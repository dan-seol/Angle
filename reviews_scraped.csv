Cheap family pack. works great.
"

These are perfect for cutting your gums off your teeth better suited for cleaning groves in your shoes not tender gums lol. Im surprised these had great reviews cheap price they are terrible I actually requested and went through the work to return them because i was so upset i tossed our old ones and had a few days with nothing to clean our teeth with (I forgot to store run so me and the kiddos smelt like dragon breathe) ended up buying expensive ones for all 3 of us because i needed a replacement fast so these actually cost be a loss even after the return. Like who returns used tooth brushes? lol
"
"
when you brush your teeth the back of the toothbrush has hard plastic that rubs on the other teeth.  feels like it would cause damage if used all the time.  good for guests if they needed one for the night i guess
"
"
OMG a FIRM toothbrush!! Yay!!! Me and my husband loathe soft toothbrushes but I guess we are the minority, because they are EVERYWHERE. So I was thrilled to find some firm ones at a cheap price and the work great!!
"
"
I bought two packs of these expecting them to be soft, as labelled. If you have legitimate health concerns or medical reasons to use soft bristles, this is absolutely not for you. I recently had gum grafts and would never have used these within the first three months post-surgery, because they would have almost certainly tore something.These are fantastic toothbrushes for someone who likes hard, aggressive bristles. They’re sleek, lightweight, and have a tongue scraper which is nice. If these were at all soft, they would be five stars. But the whole reason I chose to purchase these was because they were alleged to be soft, which they’re so far from it’s almost laughable.
"
"
I bought these because  I thought they were going to be soft. And they don't let us buy less than 2 packages minimum. I thought it was a good deal anyway.Problem is, these toothbrush are nothing but soft. They make my gum bleed so bad!! I can't even imagine what their ''medium'' and ''hard'' bristles feel like.Those toothbrush feel like I am brushing my teeth with sandpaper.I don't like to complain, but this product is so bad that  I felt it was my DUTY to warn other people.Unless you like being in pain and spitting blood when you brush your teeth, avoid at all costs.Wish they would offer a refund if they care about their customers.
"
"
I liked the price.The bristles are very firm, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Anyone else notice that it's difficult to find hard-bristled toothbrushes in stores?Anyway, I use this toothbrush for my tongue only, and it works great.I found that I was going through so many of my soft-bristled toothbrushes because I  was using them to brush my teeth and my tongue, causing the bristles to wear out very quickly.Now that I've purchased a few of these hard-bristled toothbrushes, I dont have to worry about damaging the soft-bristled ones that I have.
"
"
Love firm toothbrushesWork well.Only complaint is my wife and I use same kind of toothbrush. She uses pink and purple and I use blue and green. Lots of pink ones in cupboard so ordered 10 of these as it showed green colour. Came with one green, 3 blue and test pink and purple. Will get used eventually
"
"
They’re not bad but they’re not particularly soft. And they’re not all the same colour like the picture.The handle is very long and thin as is the brush head. Cleaned well but not what I was expecting.
"
"
Don't buy it, although it's cheap won't be used a few times. It feels like the soft-bristled toothbrushes not straight. The toothbrush is also not convex and convex, can not brush cleanly, it is almost the same as a one-off. Still, recommend buying an electric toothbrush.

Bought 4. Good thing they were cheap because I wont be using these.They are not soft at all. If your looking for a soft toothbrush do not buy this.You wont use it. Headline is misleading. False information!
"
"
They have better ones at the local pharmacy, these Colgate were supposed to be soft, but not the softness I expected. Too late to return them now. Should have tried them earlier.
"
"
These are decent brushes. If you're looking for a better manual toothbrush, get the more expensive Oral-B Pro-Health 2 brush pack. I find that does a better job of cleaning all the surfaces of my teeth.
"
"
I like to alternate from firm to medium to firm for best cleaning...  Overall quality of the brush is excellent, and the price was super awesome!
"
"
Way better than expected for the price.  All they miss is a rubber back for a cheek/tongue cleaner but they are ridged so not too bad.  Cleans well.
"
"
The bristles are pretty firm and feel good on your teeth. Cleans pretty well and is a pretty standard toothbrush. The handle is a little thin and awkward in my opinion and not very ergonomic. It does the job thou.
"
"
For those that prefer and firm toothbrush this fits the bill. For this price you can throw them out after a weeks use if need be.
"
"
The driver asked me to come down to the lobby to pick up my items which is very unusual. This is not a contactless delivery unfortunately.
"
"
I find the handles way too thin, and it is quite a large brush head. Makes it difficult to reach the back molars. On price point and arrival you can't beat it, but not the brushes for me.
"
"
Je m'attendais a plus doux vu que sur le paquet c'est écris Soft mais bon a part ça ça va. Ce sont des brosses à dents comme les autres.
"
"
good value, bough soft brushes but are more feeling like normal stiffness.
"
"
Great add-on product for a larger order. Good toothbrushes. We have a large family and need lots of replacement toothbrushes for family and friends that stay over and forget their toothbrush.
"
"
Simple soft toothbrushes. Use them for cleaning small intricate spots in the car. Better than buying a detailing brush set.
"
"
Great price, I don't always have toothbrushes in my shopping list. It was nice to be able to order a pack to keep around for guests as well as extra toothbrushes for myself.
"
"
Good product, as expected. I like to keep them on hand for overnight guests who forget their toothbrush. These are perfect.
"
"
They came very quickly.  Soft and comfortable thus far, would recommend.
"
"
They say ""soft"" but they are too hard for sensitive gums. These have now been relegated to cleaning tools for tile grout and hard to reach areas.
"
"
As described
"
"
Great Product! Well Packaged and Fast Shipping!Highly Recommend! A+++++++++++++
"
"
The toothbrushes are not as long lasting as I had anticipated after a few day’s use. Otherwise a great package to have for anyone who needs a temporary toothbrush for home or travel
"
"
These clean my teeth really well, leaves them feeling like I've left the dentist. The tongue scraper is a welcomed bonus.
"
"
Its a tooth brush. What else can I say. Its perfectly fine.
"
"
They work like any other soft toothbrush. Nothing special but nothing bad about the.
"
"
The brush aren't soft, more a medium feeling. I'm disappointed since I have sensitive gums.
"
"
No need for batteries.Just some arm workout.My teeth say yay.
"
"
Amazon should be paying me $1 for each one I bought as a disposal fee.  These brushes must be rejected ones from the factory.
"
"
Très économique par rapport à l’achat à l’unité.
"
"
Only buy these tooth brushes if you want a bristle stuck in your mouth every time you brush your teeth.
"
"
Not bad when on sale.We have been using these for a while and happy with them.
"
"
Love this product. Was sending them to Haiti on a Missionary trip with a co-worker
"
"
just what I needed for my sensitive teeth. nice and soft. the handle part feels too thin to hold even for my small hand.
"
"
Pas reçu celle commandé comme sur l’image. Poil trop dur même si commandé souple. Pas du tout ce que j’avais commandé.
"
"
Ordered it for 5.00 with a rebate of .75Definitely a steal:)
"
"
Bon produit expédition rapide
"
"
I bought 2 tooth brushes cuz that's the minimum (around $2 CAD) and I needed free shipping, But i'm not gonna lie these were much higher quality then what I bought 2 days ago for $3 CAD
"
"
Bought for Christmas Hampers
"
"
Great for using dental cleaning paste to remove build up.
"
"
moi j;aime bien  pas trop cher :et en quantitémerci au vendeur
"
"
Got these as an add on item and they work good.
"
"
This tooth brush is soft but it’s not as soft as the other ones I’ve used, but overall it’s not bad, good value and good to use as a disposable toothbrush when traveling.
"
"
I found this tooth brush too soft (I always use soft but this is softer than usual) but for the price, it is okay. I will use it as a travel toothbrush.
"
"
Les brosses à dents de type ferme sont difficiles à trouver dans les magasins et pharmacies. Merci de continuer la vente sur Amazone.:)
"
"
Ca brosse mes dents. C'est ce qui compte!
"
"
I am very happy with the price
"
"
Good toothbrush,it’s soft. Will buy again. I recommend this product.
"
"
Not soft enough for my sensitive teeth.
"
"
Très bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
They're tooth brushes...
"
"
They should be listed or advertised as children's toothbrushes
"
"
The description is quite frankly incorrect. The bristles are harder than steel wire, and can possible scrape baked-on grease off an oven pan.
"
"
Nice clean
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Worth it
"
"
Good value great add on
"
"
Good product

I just opened the first package of six brushes yesterday, and the brush is very hard and not at labelled as soft on the package. Too hard on my gums.

The handle is really narrow - feels like a kids toothbrush. My husband won't use his! Definitely won't be reordering this item.

"

Too soft for a firm toothbrush
"

These are not soft at all they are actually hard.  Threw away as they hurt my gums

Will purchase again love these toothbrushes
"
"
It says they’re soft but it really doesn’t feel like it. It’s at least a medium
"
"
Felt like I was brushing my teeth with a wire brush.
"
"
Does what it’s supposed too
"
"
not as soft as i expected.
"
"
nice firm brush
"
"
good
"
"
Great for the price I’m happy
"
"
It says ‘soft’, but it definitely feels like medium
"
"
Good value. Much cheaper than buying at a store.
"
"
I purchased these as well as some cases to take with me while I travel. For the price, these are great quality tooth brushes. Colgate makes good quality products and these are no exception. The bristles are decently soft, which is good for making sure you don't scrape your teeth too hard.
"
"
I would not recommend unless soft for you means medium or medium hard.
"
"
Great set of darts! Weighting is easy to adjust to and control.
"
"
Its a toothbrush.
"
"
At first I thought I had bought the wrong one but the label clearly says ""soft"", despite all evidence to the contrary. I have seen shoe brushes that are softer. Maybe they put the wrong one in the package ? Maybe their test customer is Jaws from James Bond ? I do not know. But I will not keep using it, unless a friendly porcupine needs a robust brushing to work the tangles out.
"
"
I am not buying this product again
"
"
The original one displayed says with tongue cleaner grip behind the head but the one they ship is just the ordinary full plastic toothbrush. -totally misleading…
"
"
Good
"
"
These toothbrushes do not feel soft & irritate gums
"
"
Produit conforme à la description
"
"
You get 4 soft bristle toothbrushes cheap can't complain ! They work well .
"
"
A steal of a deal!
"
"
Does the job as required. Price is right.
"
"
i can't believe they call the ""soft"" you'll rip out your gums using those brush
"
"
good for price.Not the best quality
"
"
Okay....
"
"
good
"
"
If this is what they consider extra soft I would hate to see what hard would be like.
"
"
good
"
"
Though this is a great deal, the toothbrushes labelled ""Soft"" actually feel more like firm. Ouch! Won't be buying again.
"
"
Modified toothbrush this is the firm one just what I was looking for for the price great deal and it’s hard to find firm toothbrushes in the grocery store
"
"
Labelled “soft”. They are not, especially compared to the other brands.Bright side? Got some cheap brushes for car cleaning.....
"
"
The bristles are alright, a little long for my liking and some were bent right out of the package. And the ""tongue cleaner"" is so short it's practically useless. I guess you get what you pay for, even with toothbrushes.
"
"
These toothbrushes succeed at brushing my teeth, which is all I really wanted from them. Thanks, toothbrushes.
"
"
These are nothing special.  The handles on these brushes are thinner than most.  They are fine for a toothbrush that gets the job done.
"
"
Great price and very lightweight (even for toothbrushes)
"
"
Cannot claim that it's the best tooth brush. But it's one of the best bang for your buck. Decent brush with excellent price.
"
"
This has so far been my favourite manual toothbrush. But to warn, the bristles aren't actually very soft,
"
"
Great price, but the brushes themselves are pretty stiff/hard...even though they're labeled as soft. They make my gums bleed, but they clean my teeth like any other ordinary toothbrush.Would I purchase this again? NoDo I recommend this product? If you're looking for a truly soft brush, no.
"
"
Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush, Soft, 6 Count my Granadas happy thanks
"
"
I brush my teeth almost compulsively, I love that these come in 5 pack! bang for your buck
"
"
Disappointing. It is supposed to be firm. But it has a small and soft brush.
"
"
Yeap Yeap Yeap...Yes, they are toothbrushes from a known brand, they work as expected, will purchase again...
"
"
It's so hard to find firm tooth brushes in the stores. So glad I found some on here.
"
"
These brushes work well and are a good value on Amazon.
"
"
Found brushes to clean well. Bristles not overly soft.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush and does the job of keeping my teeth clean.  Use it twice a day.
"
"
Bought to have spares for guests. Work well!
"
"
We always buys these toothbrushes, they work well for the whole family.
"
"
good brushes for adults; prices comparable to stores but don't have to go out and buy them.
"
"
good quality
"
"
Unlike some other toothbrushes I've used, I can tell these are cleaning the whole surface of my teeth instead of only part of them.
"
"
Good toothbrushes, they do the job, easy on the gums!
"
"
Not so soft as the label indicates...looking elsewhere for soft toothbrushes.
"
"
C es des brosse a dent a font la job

Successfully cleaned my teeth with these, as well as a few small electronic components.
"
"
Good product in Budget price!Product RECOMMENDED!!
"
"
Fast shipping and good product
"
"
Thanks!
"
"
Good value, but feel cheap and bristles are very tough. I will probably not buy these again.
"
"
They are only good after 5 brushes then they are useless
"
"
toothbrushes what can you say
"
"
As described.  Thank you.
"
"
What can I say just an average tooth brush. Bought them as throwaways for guests!
"
"
Good value, great toothbrusj

Good toothbrushes

Overall ok product
"

Bristles are harder than you would expect for a soft toothbrush; excellent value for the money.

Great soft brushes.

your ordinary ""soft"" brushes.

Cleans well.
"

Not very soft. Feels very cheap too.
"
"
...love the multi-pack, my favorite brushes
"
"
For a soft toothbrush, the bristles are VERY firm
"
"
as shown

Hard to find soft bristle for this price! will buy again!
"

Buy again

"
"
Great value
"
"
Great.
"
"
Perfect.
"
"
Exactly as described
"
"
The title says exactly what they are. They are good quality toothbrushes that will longer than the recommend 3 months for toothbrushes. This pack is great for families or for anyone looking for a bargain!
"
"
I am a fan of buying multiples. When my toothbrush looks sad I like to quickly replace it. Nice bristle action, soft but not too soft, nice size, multiple colours so I don't get my toothbrush mixed up with my partner's. How gross is that?
"
"
Colgate
"
"
I have these on hand for guest toothbrushes as they are at a great low price point and they do a good job.I also like them for personal use - I use an electric toothbrush 95% of the time but when I want to do a fast manual brushing these work just fine. I have sensitive gums and teeth and while they are not as soft as your regular soft tooth brushes the shape is great for getting at all the teeth and in between to ensure everything is clean.I would recommend if you are looking for a reasonably priced pack of higher end tooth brushes that work well. They are not your sonic 360 toothbrushes with gum scrubbers and all that fancy stuff but they are absolutely fine.
"
"
These are simple and effective, nothing too fancy, but they keep my mouth clean. At least 2 months of use before I noticed any signs of wear. Great value.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Not much to be said other than it's a good deal and they work as well as you'd expect them to.
"
"
Bristles don't fall out, brushes teeth. Does regular toothbrush things. Pretty cheap.
"
"
My teeth are clean.
"
"
thank you
"
"
Rapport qualité-prix intéressant!!
"
"
The brush head could have been a little bigger
"
"
Came as described.
"
"
Good
"
"
Cheap family pack. works great.
"
"
These are perfect for cutting your gums off your teeth better suited for cleaning groves in your shoes not tender gums lol. Im surprised these had great reviews cheap price they are terrible I actually requested and went through the work to return them because i was so upset i tossed our old ones and had a few days with nothing to clean our teeth with (I forgot to store run so me and the kiddos smelt like dragon breathe) ended up buying expensive ones for all 3 of us because i needed a replacement fast so these actually cost be a loss even after the return. Like who returns used tooth brushes? lol
"
"
when you brush your teeth the back of the toothbrush has hard plastic that rubs on the other teeth.  feels like it would cause damage if used all the time.  good for guests if they needed one for the night i guess
"
"
OMG a FIRM toothbrush!! Yay!!! Me and my husband loathe soft toothbrushes but I guess we are the minority, because they are EVERYWHERE. So I was thrilled to find some firm ones at a cheap price and the work great!!
"
"
I bought two packs of these expecting them to be soft, as labelled. If you have legitimate health concerns or medical reasons to use soft bristles, this is absolutely not for you. I recently had gum grafts and would never have used these within the first three months post-surgery, because they would have almost certainly tore something.These are fantastic toothbrushes for someone who likes hard, aggressive bristles. They’re sleek, lightweight, and have a tongue scraper which is nice. If these were at all soft, they would be five stars. But the whole reason I chose to purchase these was because they were alleged to be soft, which they’re so far from it’s almost laughable.
"
"
I bought these because  I thought they were going to be soft. And they don't let us buy less than 2 packages minimum. I thought it was a good deal anyway.Problem is, these toothbrush are nothing but soft. They make my gum bleed so bad!! I can't even imagine what their ''medium'' and ''hard'' bristles feel like.Those toothbrush feel like I am brushing my teeth with sandpaper.I don't like to complain, but this product is so bad that  I felt it was my DUTY to warn other people.Unless you like being in pain and spitting blood when you brush your teeth, avoid at all costs.Wish they would offer a refund if they care about their customers.
"
"
I liked the price.The bristles are very firm, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Anyone else notice that it's difficult to find hard-bristled toothbrushes in stores?Anyway, I use this toothbrush for my tongue only, and it works great.I found that I was going through so many of my soft-bristled toothbrushes because I  was using them to brush my teeth and my tongue, causing the bristles to wear out very quickly.Now that I've purchased a few of these hard-bristled toothbrushes, I dont have to worry about damaging the soft-bristled ones that I have.
"
"
Love firm toothbrushesWork well.Only complaint is my wife and I use same kind of toothbrush. She uses pink and purple and I use blue and green. Lots of pink ones in cupboard so ordered 10 of these as it showed green colour. Came with one green, 3 blue and test pink and purple. Will get used eventually
"
"
They’re not bad but they’re not particularly soft. And they’re not all the same colour like the picture.The handle is very long and thin as is the brush head. Cleaned well but not what I was expecting.
"
"
Don't buy it, although it's cheap won't be used a few times. It feels like the soft-bristled toothbrushes not straight. The toothbrush is also not convex and convex, can not brush cleanly, it is almost the same as a one-off. Still, recommend buying an electric toothbrush.

Like who returns used tooth brushes? lol
"
"
when you brush your teeth the back of the toothbrush has hard plastic that rubs on the other teeth.  feels like it would cause damage if used all the time.  good for guests if they needed one for the night i guess
"
"
OMG a FIRM toothbrush!! Yay!!! Me and my husband loathe soft toothbrushes but I guess we are the minority, because they are EVERYWHERE. So I was thrilled to find some firm ones at a cheap price and the work great!!
"
"
I bought two packs of these expecting them to be soft, as labelled. If you have legitimate health concerns or medical reasons to use soft bristles, this is absolutely not for you. I recently had gum grafts and would never have used these within the first three months post-surgery, because they would have almost certainly tore something.These are fantastic toothbrushes for someone who likes hard, aggressive bristles. They’re sleek, lightweight, and have a tongue scraper which is nice. If these were at all soft, they would be five stars. But the whole reason I chose to purchase these was because they were alleged to be soft, which they’re so far from it’s almost laughable.
"
"
I bought these because  I thought they were going to be soft. And they don't let us buy less than 2 packages minimum. I thought it was a good deal anyway.Problem is, these toothbrush are nothing but soft. They make my gum bleed so bad!! I can't even imagine what their ''medium'' and ''hard'' bristles feel like.Those toothbrush feel like I am brushing my teeth with sandpaper.I don't like to complain, but this product is so bad that  I felt it was my DUTY to warn other people.Unless you like being in pain and spitting blood when you brush your teeth, avoid at all costs.Wish they would offer a refund if they care about their customers.
"
"
I liked the price.The bristles are very firm, which is exactly what I was looking for.  Anyone else notice that it's difficult to find hard-bristled toothbrushes in stores?Anyway, I use this toothbrush for my tongue only, and it works great.I found that I was going through so many of my soft-bristled toothbrushes because I  was using them to brush my teeth and my tongue, causing the bristles to wear out very quickly.Now that I've purchased a few of these hard-bristled toothbrushes, I dont have to worry about damaging the soft-bristled ones that I have.
"
"
Love firm toothbrushesWork well.Only complaint is my wife and I use same kind of toothbrush. She uses pink and purple and I use blue and green. Lots of pink ones in cupboard so ordered 10 of these as it showed green colour. Came with one green, 3 blue and test pink and purple. Will get used eventually
"
"
They’re not bad but they’re not particularly soft. And they’re not all the same colour like the picture.The handle is very long and thin as is the brush head. Cleaned well but not what I was expecting.
"
"
Don't buy it, although it's cheap won't be used a few times. It feels like the soft-bristled toothbrushes not straight. The toothbrush is also not convex and convex, can not brush cleanly, it is almost the same as a one-off. Still, recommend buying an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Bought 4. Good thing they were cheap because I wont be using these.They are not soft at all. If your looking for a soft toothbrush do not buy this.You wont use it. Headline is misleading. False information!
"
"
They have better ones at the local pharmacy, these Colgate were supposed to be soft, but not the softness I expected. Too late to return them now. Should have tried them earlier.
"
"
These are decent brushes. If you're looking for a better manual toothbrush, get the more expensive Oral-B Pro-Health 2 brush pack. I find that does a better job of cleaning all the surfaces of my teeth.
"
"
I like to alternate from firm to medium to firm for best cleaning...  Overall quality of the brush is excellent, and the price was super awesome!
"
"
Way better than expected for the price.  All they miss is a rubber back for a cheek/tongue cleaner but they are ridged so not too bad.  Cleans well.
"
"
The bristles are pretty firm and feel good on your teeth. Cleans pretty well and is a pretty standard toothbrush. The handle is a little thin and awkward in my opinion and not very ergonomic. It does the job thou.
"
"
For those that prefer and firm toothbrush this fits the bill. For this price you can throw them out after a weeks use if need be.
"
"
The driver asked me to come down to the lobby to pick up my items which is very unusual. This is not a contactless delivery unfortunately.
"
"
I find the handles way too thin, and it is quite a large brush head. Makes it difficult to reach the back molars. On price point and arrival you can't beat it, but not the brushes for me.
"
"
Je m'attendais a plus doux vu que sur le paquet c'est écris Soft mais bon a part ça ça va. Ce sont des brosses à dents comme les autres.
"
"
good value, bough soft brushes but are more feeling like normal stiffness.
"
"
Great add-on product for a larger order. Good toothbrushes. We have a large family and need lots of replacement toothbrushes for family and friends that stay over and forget their toothbrush.
"
"
Simple soft toothbrushes. Use them for cleaning small intricate spots in the car. Better than buying a detailing brush set.
"
"
Great price, I don't always have toothbrushes in my shopping list. It was nice to be able to order a pack to keep around for guests as well as extra toothbrushes for myself.
"
"
Good product, as expected. I like to keep them on hand for overnight guests who forget their toothbrush. These are perfect.
"
"
They came very quickly.  Soft and comfortable thus far, would recommend.
"
"
They say ""soft"" but they are too hard for sensitive gums. These have now been relegated to cleaning tools for tile grout and hard to reach areas.
"
"
As described
"
"
Great Product! Well Packaged and Fast Shipping!Highly Recommend! A+++++++++++++
"
"
The toothbrushes are not as long lasting as I had anticipated after a few day’s use. Otherwise a great package to have for anyone who needs a temporary toothbrush for home or travel
"
"
These clean my teeth really well, leaves them feeling like I've left the dentist. The tongue scraper is a welcomed bonus.
"
"
Its a tooth brush. What else can I say. Its perfectly fine.
"
"
They work like any other soft toothbrush. Nothing special but nothing bad about the.
"
"
The brush aren't soft, more a medium feeling. I'm disappointed since I have sensitive gums.
"
"
No need for batteries.Just some arm workout.My teeth say yay.
"
"
Amazon should be paying me $1 for each one I bought as a disposal fee.  These brushes must be rejected ones from the factory.
"
"
Très économique par rapport à l’achat à l’unité.
"
"
Only buy these tooth brushes if you want a bristle stuck in your mouth every time you brush your teeth.
"
"
Not bad when on sale.We have been using these for a while and happy with them.
"
"
Love this product. Was sending them to Haiti on a Missionary trip with a co-worker
"
"
just what I needed for my sensitive teeth. nice and soft. the handle part feels too thin to hold even for my small hand.
"
"
Pas reçu celle commandé comme sur l’image. Poil trop dur même si commandé souple. Pas du tout ce que j’avais commandé.
"
"
Ordered it for 5.00 with a rebate of .75Definitely a steal:)
"
"
Bon produit expédition rapide
"
"
I bought 2 tooth brushes cuz that's the minimum (around $2 CAD) and I needed free shipping, But i'm not gonna lie these were much higher quality then what I bought 2 days ago for $3 CAD
"
"
Bought for Christmas Hampers
"
"
Great for using dental cleaning paste to remove build up.
"
"
moi j;aime bien  pas trop cher :et en quantitémerci au vendeur
"
"
Got these as an add on item and they work good.
"
"
This tooth brush is soft but it’s not as soft as the other ones I’ve used, but overall it’s not bad, good value and good to use as a disposable toothbrush when traveling.
"
"
I found this tooth brush too soft (I always use soft but this is softer than usual) but for the price, it is okay. I will use it as a travel toothbrush.
"
"
Les brosses à dents de type ferme sont difficiles à trouver dans les magasins et pharmacies. Merci de continuer la vente sur Amazone.:)
"
"
Ca brosse mes dents. C'est ce qui compte!
"
"
I am very happy with the price
"
"
Good toothbrush,it’s soft. Will buy again. I recommend this product.
"
"
Not soft enough for my sensitive teeth.
"
"
Très bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
They're tooth brushes...
"
"
They should be listed or advertised as children's toothbrushes
"
"
The description is quite frankly incorrect. The bristles are harder than steel wire, and can possible scrape baked-on grease off an oven pan.
"
"
Nice clean
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Worth it
"
"
Good value great add on

It says they’re soft but it really doesn’t feel like it. It’s at least a medium
"
"
Felt like I was brushing my teeth with a wire brush.
"
"
Does what it’s supposed too
"
"
not as soft as i expected.
"
"
nice firm brush
"
"
good
"
"
Great for the price I’m happy
"
"
It says ‘soft’, but it definitely feels like medium
"
"
Good value. Much cheaper than buying at a store.
"
"
I purchased these as well as some cases to take with me while I travel. For the price, these are great quality tooth brushes. Colgate makes good quality products and these are no exception. The bristles are decently soft, which is good for making sure you don't scrape your teeth too hard.
"
"
I would not recommend unless soft for you means medium or medium hard.
"
"
Great set of darts! Weighting is easy to adjust to and control.
"
"
Its a toothbrush.
"
"
At first I thought I had bought the wrong one but the label clearly says ""soft"", despite all evidence to the contrary. I have seen shoe brushes that are softer. Maybe they put the wrong one in the package ? Maybe their test customer is Jaws from James Bond ? I do not know. But I will not keep using it, unless a friendly porcupine needs a robust brushing to work the tangles out.
"
"
I am not buying this product again
"
"
The original one displayed says with tongue cleaner grip behind the head but the one they ship is just the ordinary full plastic toothbrush. -totally misleading…
"
"
Good
"
"
These toothbrushes do not feel soft & irritate gums
"
"
Produit conforme à la description
"
"
You get 4 soft bristle toothbrushes cheap can't complain ! They work well .
"
"
A steal of a deal!
"
"
Does the job as required. Price is right.
"
"
i can't believe they call the ""soft"" you'll rip out your gums using those brush
"
"
good for price.Not the best quality
"
"
Okay....
"
"
good
"
"
If this is what they consider extra soft I would hate to see what hard would be like.
"
"
good
"
"
Though this is a great deal, the toothbrushes labelled ""Soft"" actually feel more like firm. Ouch! Won't be buying again.
"
"
Modified toothbrush this is the firm one just what I was looking for for the price great deal and it’s hard to find firm toothbrushes in the grocery store
"
"
Labelled “soft”. They are not, especially compared to the other brands.Bright side? Got some cheap brushes for car cleaning.....
"
"
The bristles are alright, a little long for my liking and some were bent right out of the package. And the ""tongue cleaner"" is so short it's practically useless. I guess you get what you pay for, even with toothbrushes.
"
"
These toothbrushes succeed at brushing my teeth, which is all I really wanted from them. Thanks, toothbrushes.
"
"
These are nothing special.  The handles on these brushes are thinner than most.  They are fine for a toothbrush that gets the job done.
"
"
Great price and very lightweight (even for toothbrushes)
"
"
Cannot claim that it's the best tooth brush. But it's one of the best bang for your buck. Decent brush with excellent price.
"
"
This has so far been my favourite manual toothbrush. But to warn, the bristles aren't actually very soft,
"
"
Great price, but the brushes themselves are pretty stiff/hard...even though they're labeled as soft. They make my gums bleed, but they clean my teeth like any other ordinary toothbrush.Would I purchase this again? NoDo I recommend this product? If you're looking for a truly soft brush, no.
"
"
Colgate Extra Clean Toothbrush, Soft, 6 Count my Granadas happy thanks
"
"
I brush my teeth almost compulsively, I love that these come in 5 pack! bang for your buck
"
"
Disappointing. It is supposed to be firm. But it has a small and soft brush.
"
"
Yeap Yeap Yeap...Yes, they are toothbrushes from a known brand, they work as expected, will purchase again...
"
"
It's so hard to find firm tooth brushes in the stores. So glad I found some on here.
"
"
These brushes work well and are a good value on Amazon.
"
"
Found brushes to clean well. Bristles not overly soft.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush and does the job of keeping my teeth clean.  Use it twice a day.
"
"
Bought to have spares for guests. Work well!
"
"
We always buys these toothbrushes, they work well for the whole family.
"
"
good brushes for adults; prices comparable to stores but don't have to go out and buy them.
"
"
good quality
"
"
Unlike some other toothbrushes I've used, I can tell these are cleaning the whole surface of my teeth instead of only part of them.
"
"
Good toothbrushes, they do the job, easy on the gums!
"
"
Not so soft as the label indicates...looking elsewhere for soft toothbrushes.
"

Thanks!
"
"
Good value, but feel cheap and bristles are very tough. I will probably not buy these again.
"
"
They are only good after 5 brushes then they are useless
"
"
toothbrushes what can you say
"
"
As described.  Thank you.

What can I say just an average tooth brush. Bought them as throwaways for guests!

Perfect.

Exactly as described

"
The title says exactly what they are. They are good quality toothbrushes that will longer than the recommend 3 months for toothbrushes. This pack is great for families or for anyone looking for a bargain!
"
"
I am a fan of buying multiples. When my toothbrush looks sad I like to quickly replace it. Nice bristle action, soft but not too soft, nice size, multiple colours so I don't get my toothbrush mixed up with my partner's. How gross is that?
"
"
Colgate
"
"
I have these on hand for guest toothbrushes as they are at a great low price point and they do a good job.I also like them for personal use - I use an electric toothbrush 95% of the time but when I want to do a fast manual brushing these work just fine. I have sensitive gums and teeth and while they are not as soft as your regular soft tooth brushes the shape is great for getting at all the teeth and in between to ensure everything is clean.I would recommend if you are looking for a reasonably priced pack of higher end tooth brushes that work well. They are not your sonic 360 toothbrushes with gum scrubbers and all that fancy stuff but they are absolutely fine.
"
"
These are simple and effective, nothing too fancy, but they keep my mouth clean. At least 2 months of use before I noticed any signs of wear. Great value.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Not much to be said other than it's a good deal and they work as well as you'd expect them to.
"
"
Bristles don't fall out, brushes teeth. Does regular toothbrush things. Pretty cheap.
"
"
My teeth are clean.
"
"
thank you

Rapport qualité-prix intéressant!!

The brush head could have been a little bigger
"
"
Came as described.

Good
"
"
 Have been using this toothbrush last 10 days.Liked: - High quality. brushes far better than my previous brushes. - Long standing batteries. Havnt recharged yet since I bought. Charge holds good for long timeDisliked: - There are 5 modes. Didnt find very useful for 5 modes. Usually use the first mode only.Overall: Very happy to buy a quality product.
"
"
1 month update:  The original head is still holding up well, and the battery lasts a really long time.  I didn't even charge it once since receiving it and using it two times per day, it still has a charge after a month.I have owned an electric toothbrush by Oral-B which I got on sale earlier last year and while it was doing a sufficient job, I didn't like the fact that it was a rotating toothbrush as I wanted an ultrasonic one instead.  So I purchased this toothbrush  as it offered good features and value (a Philips Ultrasonic is quite expensive), while I was initially skeptical about how it would perform, I was pleasantly surprised I have never felt such a powerful clean before outside of going to the dentist.Inside the package there are lots of replacement brush heads, a flossing head, charging cables, and a hard magnetic case.  Turning the unit on, I was surprised at how strong the motor was, I had to change the setting from White to Clean as the White setting is very strong and it was 'tickling' my lips, but it does give an amazing clean.  The unit also has an indication of when to switch brushing sides by stopping the motor for a split second so you always brush for the right amount of time.If I had any concerns with the product, it would be the availability of replacement heads since they are not necessarily available in every drug store, however since you get so many in the box, you wouldn't be needing replacement heads for a very long time and the entire set costs less than a few replacement heads from a more well known brand.
"
"
I never used this kind of electric toothbrush before, my first experience is positive, so I am not a full aficionado. I got it 2 weeks ago, and I have been using them ever since. I liked the 2 min timer function that pauses in 30 sec intervals, this function can perfectly spend the correct time on each section of your teeth and get a full cleaning. The kit comes with some replaceable heads, so I can use for at least 8 months without need to buy new replacement heads.
"
"
I am happy with the purchase and product. This product is perfect size and Quality product. I love the product. The product is well made with the high quality standard materials. I love the design and style of the tooth brush. They are soft and comfortable to use. They are easy to install and easy to use. The product has good battery life and durable. The price is great and affordable. This product is rechargeable that it do not need batteries and thus saves you money. A must have product for your teeth  and it serves its purpose. This brush has different modes and vibration. This product helps to brighten you teeth and remove all the stains from your teeth and gives a good shining to your teeth. Good value for the money and great item to give as a gift to your lover, friends, parents and other family members. They will love the gift and will be surprised by this product benefits. A wonderful product for travelling especially for international and also for camp. Easy to carry around and fits nicely on your backpack. This product is lightweight and comes with the case and a bag to carry the product. This is the best tooth brush set I ever bought and it comes with the instructions and user manual. I recommend  this product. This is great for daily and travel usage. This product helps you to have a clean and healthy teeth. You do not need a dental doctor any more and you can save lots of money and time for your family.
"
"
This is a nice looking toothbrush that I'm offering as a gift to my brother since he doesnt have an electric one. I thought it was pretty lightweight and the 6 extra brush heads is really nice. Although I wish it had a generic brush head, since this one is a twist and lock. The all black design and the carrying case looks clean!! It's nice that you can charge it with any usb connection as opposed to have a proprietary stand. Also wish it had two separate buttons for the different modes and the on/off.
"
"
This is probably one of the best value electric tooth brush in amazon. It works perfectly just like my old “branded” electric tooth brush. Even better that it’s usb power, so it can share with my other charger when I go traveling.The tooth brush itself has several different mode to choose from, it can be adjust to clean the area that you want to clean. Also it came with 5 or 6 replacement heads, just those not already worth 20 if you buy it separately! Its definitely great value toothbrush to buy!
"
"
I got this set for my sister who was looking for an electric toothbrush. When I received this the packaging is perfect for gifting. It comes with many interchange heads bristles and have a nice carrying case for the brush. It looks so elegant when given as gift, will wait till my sister uses it and let me know how it is. If it’s good I will definitely buy it again as the price is on a fair side but when compared to Oral B brand this is cheaper.
"
"
Firstly, the toothbrush came with at least 2-3 years worth of supplies of brush heads. This is very generous as I don't have to worry about buying replacement heads. Secondly, there are so many different brushing modes: Whitening, cleaning, Massage, etc. Lastly, it lasts forever! I've had it for a few weeks now and it still has juice.Overall, I recommend it.
"
"
This is about half the Strength of my diamond clean toothbrush. But perhaps about 20 percent stronger than your battery operated spin toothbrush. It is quiet - much quieter than my more expensive brush and about half the weight .It has several brushing mode options and  comes with a few replacement heads- which is awesome!I think I was hoping it would be similar brushing power to my current brush (that recently died) and it just isn’t . However - it’s a much better alternative to a manual brush and some of the less expensive battery or even rechargeable brushes . It’s got a nice sleek, black design and looks nice on my counter :) The carrying case is very nice and the charger fits right into the bottom of the brush and requires a USB plug .
"
"
I am very pleased to make a good decision by buying this toothbrush. Built quality is pretty solid and brush heads are very comfortable to use. The feature that I liked most is two minutes timer with 30 second pause signal. It comes with couple of brush heads and a travel case. I took me couple of attempts to get used to with the strong vibration. Overall a very good electric toothbrush at this price range!

The unit also has an indication of when to switch brushing sides by stopping the motor for a split second so you always brush for the right amount of time.If I had any concerns with the product, it would be the availability of replacement heads since they are not necessarily available in every drug store, however since you get so many in the box, you wouldn't be needing replacement heads for a very long time and the entire set costs less than a few replacement heads from a more well known brand.

I never used this kind of electric toothbrush before, my first experience is positive, so I am not a full aficionado. I got it 2 weeks ago, and I have been using them ever since. I liked the 2 min timer function that pauses in 30 sec intervals, this function can perfectly spend the correct time on each section of your teeth and get a full cleaning. The kit comes with some replaceable heads, so I can use for at least 8 months without need to buy new replacement heads.

This is a nice looking toothbrush that I'm offering as a gift to my brother since he doesnt have an electric one. I thought it was pretty lightweight and the 6 extra brush heads is really nice. Although I wish it had a generic brush head, since this one is a twist and lock. The all black design and the carrying case looks clean!! It's nice that you can charge it with any usb connection as opposed to have a proprietary stand. Also wish it had two separate buttons for the different modes and the on/off.
"
"
This is probably one of the best value electric tooth brush in amazon. It works perfectly just like my old “branded” electric tooth brush. Even better that it’s usb power, so it can share with my other charger when I go traveling.The tooth brush itself has several different mode to choose from, it can be adjust to clean the area that you want to clean. Also it came with 5 or 6 replacement heads, just those not already worth 20 if you buy it separately! Its definitely great value toothbrush to buy!
"
"
I got this set for my sister who was looking for an electric toothbrush. When I received this the packaging is perfect for gifting. It comes with many interchange heads bristles and have a nice carrying case for the brush. It looks so elegant when given as gift, will wait till my sister uses it and let me know how it is. If it’s good I will definitely buy it again as the price is on a fair side but when compared to Oral B brand this is cheaper.
"
"
Firstly, the toothbrush came with at least 2-3 years worth of supplies of brush heads. This is very generous as I don't have to worry about buying replacement heads. Secondly, there are so many different brushing modes: Whitening, cleaning, Massage, etc. Lastly, it lasts forever! I've had it for a few weeks now and it still has juice.Overall, I recommend it.

This is about half the Strength of my diamond clean toothbrush. But perhaps about 20 percent stronger than your battery operated spin toothbrush. It is quiet - much quieter than my more expensive brush and about half the weight .It has several brushing mode options and  comes with a few replacement heads- which is awesome!I think I was hoping it would be similar brushing power to my current brush (that recently died) and it just isn’t . However - it’s a much better alternative to a manual brush and some of the less expensive battery or even rechargeable brushes . It’s got a nice sleek, black design and looks nice on my counter :) The carrying case is very nice and the charger fits right into the bottom of the brush and requires a USB plug .
"
"
I am very pleased to make a good decision by buying this toothbrush. Built quality is pretty solid and brush heads are very comfortable to use. The feature that I liked most is two minutes timer with 30 second pause signal. It comes with couple of brush heads and a travel case. I took me couple of attempts to get used to with the strong vibration. Overall a very good electric toothbrush at this price range!
"
"
I bought this because I needed a quiet electronic toothbrush. My hygienist kept saying an electronic toothbrush is much better, but I didn't like my Oral B spinning head one because my gums always bled and it was loud. I needed a quiet one since I brush my teeth in our ensuite and my husband is always in bed before me and we currently have our infant in our room.The sensitive setting is great, no bleeding gums yet, but definitely clean feeling teeth.I also love the feature of the pause every 30 seconds to move to the next side of your mouth.I've been using it over a week, straight out the box without charging it and haven't had to charge it yet.The brush head is soft, but does come with one medium replacement, the rest are soft. It's also on the smaller side, which is great because I've had four molars pulled and I can fit the brush in between the gaps easily.I would highly recommend this toothbrush. The value is just outstanding.

First of all this is an amazing electric toothbrush for the price. JUST $45!!! Thats crazy. For that price you get a travel kit, 8 toothbrush heads and a gift of a tartar remover. There is no other electric toothbrush which can compete with this. I bought this brush as I have difficulty reaching the back of my teeths with a mormal toothbrush head. Whereas this brush can reach there and agitate, on different modes. My favorite mode is the sensitive one where it agitates and renoves any gunk that is stuck in the crevices of your teeth and takes care of your gums, if your gums are sensitive.Battery life: its amazing, it lasts me 30 days on just a couple hours of charge, its just as advertised in the description.Travel: This particular model comes with a travel case where you could put in 1 toothbrush head and your brush and be away from home for 3 months! As one toothbrush head lasts 3 months!Value for Money: for $45 you are getting a supply that could last you 2+years. There is not other electric toothbrush company that gives you this much value for this price.Lastly, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get the most out of an affordable amazing electric toothbrush. You will not regret this buy.
"
"
I just first want to mention that this is my first time buying an electronic toothbrush. My dentist recommended I get one after I had root canal. I checked in our local pharmacy and it's a bit pricy. I found this and just tried it first for a few days.I've been using this for a while and it has some power to it, this is also rechargeable which is awesome! I like the fact that I didn't have to recharge it every so often.The compact design is very good when I travel. You can easily assemble and store it for travel.It will feel different at first when you use an electronic toothbrush but you will get use to it and probably find this is much more effective to use.
"
"
I have been using Oral-B and Philips electric toothbrushes for years, but this time I decided to give this toothbrush a try because I had a tighter budget compared to the last times. also it comes with many brush heads which means I do not need to buy heads for a long time, again saving money.Now after about 10 days of using it I should say I am very happy with my purchase, its quality is as high as my previous famous brand toothbrushes or even better. It's also very stylish and has many different modes.
"
"
This is a great electric toothbrush for the price.  It comes with 5 or 6 brush heads, a nice hardshell carry/storage case and a USB charge cord.  The toothbrush itself works quite well, but lacks perhaps a bit of power compared with other more expensive models that I have used in the past.  The charge seems to be lasting quite a long time - which is nice because I can't keep it plugged in to a receptacle in the bathroom  To charge the toothbrush you require a USB adapter charger.  If you have a spare one, or one built in to a plug in your bathroom, then you will be fine.  I have to bring it into the bedroom and plug it in on a nightstand when it requires charging.  Otherwise a great buy for certain!
"
"
I received my new toothbrush on time two days ago — charged her up and used her twice yesterday.  The speed with which this toothbrush operates is astounding and it pauses every 30 seconds to remind the user to move along to a different section of the mouth!!  Absolutely terrific!!!  Far superior to the Sonicare that I have been using for the past five or six years — still much better than a manual brush.I also received an email from Fairywill Customer Service the morning after I accepted delivery to offer advice on charging, what to do if I have problems, etc.  Quite frankly, I was astounded!  Customer Service like that just doesn’t exist anymore!!!!  The brush I chose also came with a supply of replacements so I don’t have to scramble for brushes for nearly two years!!
"
"
It looks great in black with nice blue neon LEDsyou can tell from the look and feel of this toothbrush that it really is a quality made product..Good for travelers and going away for two reasons. First, if you charge it before you went away it would last for 20 days which is longer than most people's holidays. Secondly, it has a custom power lead with a USB end so you could use a PC or phone charger to charge the battery.The cleaning performance is excellent. Your teeth feel super clean and smooth after the first brush.This brush has a really comfortable, robust and quality feel to it. It outperforms major brands easily whilst undercutting them on price. It's a great brush.Highly recommended!
"
"
These toothbrushes work great, my teeth feel so clean after brushing!  Love the timer for each “quadrant” and the soft bristle heads are perfect.  Came charged and after twice daily use for 2 weeks, it’s still going strong without charging.  It’s lightweight and the storage case is very handy.  I fully wipe mine down and store it in the case after each use to prevent grime buildup.  I wish this model/set came in another colour (or more), so my wife and I could more easily tell them apart, but we put a sticker on my case and the back of my brush, to help with this issue.
"
"
I have always used a manual toothbrush before trying this electronic brush and it made all the difference. I found that I did not have to use as much hand motion to clean by teeth because the vibrations of the brush did it all for me. I have sensitive teeth and gums so I like how it has 5 modes that allow you to control the vibrations of the brush. Its fairly lightweight and easy hold and maneuver in my hand. It also comes with 8 brush heads so it will last me quite a long time!
"
"
I already have another electric toothbrush that I paid for more than this one even though that has lesser features.In short, a comprehensive set is offered with this one, 5 toothbrush heads in addition to interdental one.The given travel case is sturdy too and can bear the external loads of heavy items in travel baggage.The timer lets you know when to change the side for cleaning and 5 types of vibration frequencies make it a whole set of dental cleaner.
"
"
I owned 2 Philips Sonicares and while this one has 3/4 the cleaning power, both Sonicares both broke after only 1 year of use and costs 3x as much. I've had this for 6 months. It works well. The stem that connects the brush head to the unit is better designed than the Sonicare and will likely last longer as a result. It is light, the battery lasts for over 1 month on a single charge. Great value for money at ~$30
"
"
Wow I absolutely love this toothbrush!!! Every day I am feeling like I got a fresh cleaning from the dentist, I honestly don't know why I didn't buy one of these a long time ago. A great price compared to other brands and the battery life is awesome. I think I used mine for 3 weeks, 2 x day and it still hadn't died yet. Love all the different features, the case it came with, and all the extra brush heads. Best toothbrush ever!
"
"
Received the toothbrush at the end of May 2020, It is now June 14th and I still haven't recharged it. It is suppose to last a month, so we will see. Other than that it works great, there are different selections of vibration action which are nice. It is very light and the vibration itself is not very strong so you get use to it pretty quick. Plus it pauses every 30 seconds so you can move to the next section of teeth. Overall it is a great tooth brush plus I have spares to last me at least a year. It is definitely worth the money
"
"
good value of money - with 8 brush heads  which will last more than 1  year - i guess more than 2 years .I last time took for a brand one( want name ) for 4 times the price with same features .Vey nice packing if want to gift someoneIt had  5 modes so can be used with different modes.Battery is lasting  pretty long - Charging is convenient with a USB charging cable to use anywhere. so no more battery buy tension .
"
"
I have a larger electric toothbrush but always feel like it's too big to travel with. So I purchased this one to bring with me when I'm away. I now use this one more than my larger one because I love how it works. It has different modes and comes with a lot of replacement heads. Best of all, I love the little carrying case. It packs up small, the battery life is great, and I can throw it in any small bag. Definitely recommend
"
"
I was super excited for this tooth brush because it had some great reviews.It definitely gets my teeth nice and clean, I love that it has multiple settings and comes with extra heads and a carrying case.However it does feel cheaply made, compared to some of the other toothbrushes I have used. Which wasn’t a big deal to me, until after a day of use, the bristles started falling out of the toothbrush head. Super disappointed; it’s very unpleasant when you’re brushing your teeth and you end up with bristles in your mouth.The toothbrush and value is great, but they need to improve the toothbrush heads.
"
"
I like this product. It was my first time trying this tooth brush and I was happy with results. My teeth felt clean and smooth after brushing. The head was very easy to install. Each brush head has a different color band which is good for other family member to use. I would recommend this tooth brush to people who want a deeper cleaning than using a manual toothbrush. I would definitely buy these again.
"
"
In the past I used a spinning toothbrush or normal toothbrush. It keep receeding my gums and I felt I couldn't stop it.I take a lot of power naps and brush my teeth over and over again.This toothbrush I thought I tried it due to the good reviews and I am glad I did, you know what?BECAUSE IT WORKSSeriously, it already works out of the box, I don't have to charge it like my old toothbrush daily. It seems to never run out of batteries.It has like 7 attachments brush heads and comes with this weird plaque remover thing.I wish I got this earlier if I just knew about itI can't believe the price, it is a steal. This is the best toothbrush I ever used in my entire life. If this breaks down i'll buy another one.
"
"
I bought this back in January, held off writing a review as it was my first electric toothbrush.I had concerns at first but now love it. It has never run out of battery power but I recharge it once a month. They sent along lots of spare brushes but quality is good and I'm still on the first one.works better than I expected by far.TimH
"
"
I like the toothbrush so far, as it helps me keep my teeth clean and shiny. When I opened the box, I found so many additional items such as a carrying case, changing cable, eight extra brush heads, and a whiting head.The brush has a long handle and five different modes. I personally like to use the clean mode, as the white mode is very strong. It has been a week I am using the brush and haven’t charged it once so the battery seems everlasting.
"
"
This amazing looking toothbrush is not just good in looks, but also performs amazingly well. Neon blue light on the black colour brush looks great. It comes with 8 heads, out of which 6 are soft bristles,1 hard bristle and 1 inter dental brush head. It also comes with beautiful travel case.It works in 5 different modes, one can change the mode as per their requirement.The battery of this brush out performs any other branded company brushes. It takes couple of hours to charge the battery and it lasts for a month.I specially bought this brush for my daughter, as she doesn’t like to brush her teeth by herself, she loves this brush so much that now she is happily brushing her teeth at-least twice a day and that too by herself.
"
"
Love it! Bought one for my husband and was jealous of his nice sparkling teeth so bought myself one!it’s easy to use and battery life so far is good!Good priceEasy to use , not complicated .Lots of spare brushes and i love the polishing button. Makes my teeth feel super clean and smooth.My first electric toothbrush experience! 10/10Not bad at all!

So my hygenist recommend an ultrasonic toothbrush, namely the Philips Sonicare. After much research,  I decided the stats were comparable, and the Fairywill was *much* cheaper. This toothbrush has been a fantastic addition to our house, coming with many extra heads (also a reasonable cost to replace when they eventually wear out). This brush has a quadrant timer and multiple cleaning settings. My husband is very sensitive, so having the different settings was a must.If I could change one thing it would be to make the charger a stand. Although honestly, I still haven't charged it, so it's not a big deal.The brush heads don't have different colour options, but we just put a drop of nail polish on one. A small elastic would also work.Really, it's sleek and easy to clean. Excellent Product at a very reasonable price point.
"
"
If you have yellowish teeth or plaque and cavity in your teeth then fairywill electric toothbrush creates magic in your life. Very reasonable price and comes with extra brushes. Most important traveling case is super duper awesome gives you rich feelings. Battery life is good and it's USB charging.It has 2 minutes timer which comes handy. Last 15 days I am using this brush and already I am loving it. I am going to order more for my family members for great gift.
"
"
A great product - especially for the sale price. The battery lasts 10 - 12 days and the battery warning light flashes BEFORE it runs out of juice so you can still finish the current clean. The timer is effective and obvious. The new heads work perfectly too. I’m so impressed with the clean and power intensity on this brush. So much better than my old Oral B toothbrush!
"
"
I had a old electric toothbursh I needed to replace and this one caught my eye as I liked the sleek design and the carrying case it comes.  There are multiple settings and has a 2 minute timer which lets you know at every 30 second intervals.  It came with a bunch of extra toothbrush heads and came nicely packaged.  Great for home and travel
"
"
Très bien ! La tête est petite pour un adulte. Je préférerais une plus grosse brosse, mais c'est passable. J'aime la fonction du 2 minutes qui arrête de vibrer chaque 30 secondes pour changer de côté ! Je tiens aussi à dire qu'il faut seulement s'attendre à une vibration. La tête de la brosse à dent je bouge pas, elle ne fait que vibrer
"
"
You have to get used to the high-frequency vibrating action of  the brush, but it only takes a few days. Battery life is great, and unlike some other reviewers, I don’t find taking the brush on and off is an issue. Overall, I’m very satisfied with the product, the only thing I wish is that the brush head is a little bit bigger, so it covers the whole tooth surface at once.
"
"
After a dentist visit I decided to jump on the electric tooth brush bandwagon! I came across this one which I really like because of the travel case and all the travelling I do. Very impressed with the battery life so far and all the extra heads means I wont have to buy any new ones for a while! Great price and leaves my mouth feeling fresh every time I use it!
"
"
I bought this toothbrush about 6 months ago. When I first used it I thought I was going to have to give it away because the vibrations made my mouth feel awful, especially when brushing my upper front teeth. I kept trying, though, and within a few days I adjusted and it's been completely fine since then.What I am really impressed with is the battery life. I charged it before the first use 6 months ago, use it every day, AND HAVENT HAD TO CHARGE IT SINCE!!!! It's still running on the first charge! I'm thinking of somehow attaching the toothbrush battery to a cell phone so I can make millions on my eternal cell phone battery!Cleans well, too. I'm very pleased with it and it is definitely worth the money.
"
"
It comes with a metal container that fits the product properly and light weight too. When operating, the til of the product vibrates and have 5 different modes for different purposes  What’s actually special about this is actually the vibration intensity of the product. While the tip of the product doing its job, the bottom part was very quite!
"
"
I brought this toothbrush to replace my old one that wasn't working and it is amazing! The old one was a different brand and was only 6 months old but it kept stopping while it was on. So I brought this one because I was finally fed up with the old one. My teeth feel so much cleaner using this toothbrush. Happy with this purchase.
"
"
The Brightest smile 😁!This one is Rechargeable by USB cable, I've been using for almost one week, and the batteries live is excellent, I recharge a once.Cleaning like a Dentist and has 5 Modes and 8 Brush Heads.This Whitening Sonic toothbrush is for Adults.It came with a Travel Case.
"
"
I have to say, I have had a number of electric toothbrushes and this is the best one by far!! I love having the different settings. I've had the toothbrush for about a week now and use it twice a day and haven't had to charge it yet. Other than the first charge.The case to store it in is perfect for traveling. Love it so much, bought 2 more for my boyfriend and teenage daughter.
"
"
This brand is familiar to me as my hubby is using it for quite some time. So I thought of giving a try and purchased this electric brush with additional heads. As expected my experience is awesome! It is very easy to use and handle. I'm using it for last few weeks and feel very comfortable without any pain. Definitely recommend this to any adult 👌
"
"
I love the 2-minute timer function. Every 30 seconds it will pause a little so that you know to go brush another section. There are five modes and I like that there are different choices there to help brush my teeth. The kit comes with many brush heads and I’m happy that there were a fair amount of soft brush heads because sometimes I find normal brush heads too harsh on my teeth. And it’s also very convenient that I don’t have to search and buy new brush heads anytime soon. It also comes with a very nice black magnetic case to place the toothbrush in.I have never used an electric toothbrush before and I am very happy with this first time purchase. I really love the black color with the neon blue light of this toothbrush. The battery is amazing because one charge for only a few hours really does last quite a while before needing to charge it again.This electric toothbrush was not too pricey either so I feel that buying this product package was totally worth it.
"
"
You definitely get your value for what you paid for. I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this item because I never paid anything under $75 for a powered toothbrush. I do have to say that this toothbrush rivals the expensive brands. Im hoping that the battery life cycle lasts at least 3 years, if it does I'll be buying this brand exclusively going forward. I got 4 years out of my oral B rechargeable toothbrush and I paid $80 for it. With all the brush heads and the hard storage/ travel case that comes with it this product is a steal. My only complaint, and maybe it's because I'm expecting too much for the price point..... is that I prefer a more stiff or hard brush head and it only comes with 1. All the other brush heads are soft. I know it's recommended to use soft bristles but I prefer hard bristles. I used the soft bristles and they cleaned my teeth just as good, so this is strictly a selfish complaint because the teeth cleaning isn't compromised. After a week of owning this product without any hiccups it's definitely a 5 star product so here's hoping to a great battery life cycle🍻Anything less than a 2 year battery life cycle wouldn't be worth it and I would drop my star rating. Battery life cycle is the key here because the performance is great. The juice is definitely worth the squeeze.
"
"
Easy to use, comes with many replacement heads, and has many brushing modes. Just wish the heads were a little bigger.The previous electric toothbrush I had was around the same price but the brush heads were much better quality (i.e more sturdy, had tongue cleaner).Update:The company has personally reached out to me regarding my concerns. This really speaks to their level of customer service, and I am quite impressed. This definitely makes me more confident when purchasing future products from them!
"
"
Gave this one a try based on the reviews I read.I wish it came with an option of having round rotating heads.Besides that, it's an okay toothbrush. It came in a nice package. The design was really nice, easy to use and straight forward. I just with it would give me a better ""clean"" feeling (but that's personal preference)I honestly have nothing bad to say about this product.
"
"
I used the original Sonicare for years and loved it. It finally broke and I refused to replace it for $00s. Fairywill is great and is, like the chickens, cheap, cheap, cheap. First jump in technology for a while, too -- the li-on battery means no having to keep it plugged in. Plus higher voltage allows higher frequency. Plus the extra heads allow you to use this for a l-o-n-g time without worry about the fairy dying and leaving you brush-less.
"
"
Very nice compact toothbrush. I like the travelling case that comes with it. Also no bulky charging station. It charges with a USB cable. Comes with 7 new toothbrush heads and one massaging head. If you don't want to use the travel case it comes with a clear toothbrush head protector.
"
"
Good quality and impressiveIt is so soft and flexible which makes it easy to reach every corner of my mouth.Nice design and battery life is amazing.Smart timer is great.  So far, it's working great for my sensitive teeth. If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get. Recommend!
"
"
When I ordered this toothbrush I was a little skeptical. I had been contemplating on buying from one of the major brands (ie. Oral B, Sonicare, etc). When I came across this sleek looking electric toothbrush I began reading reviews and was met with tons of positive feedback. So I took a chance and ordered the toothbrush (I know I'm sounding like this was a huge decision - but it was for me!) When I got it in the mail a few days later I began using it right away. My teeth have never felt so clean and I loved the options of having 5 settings to choose from as well as soft and hard bristle options. My teeth felt like I had just been for a dental cleaning all in 2 minutes! Then about a month later I was hit with a problem. The toothbrush randomly stopped turning on, so I contacted customer support at Fairywill. Hours later I recieved a follow up email from a representative named Holly who made my experience so exceptional. I told her what was happening with the product and was met with a quick and seamless solution. They promptly mailed me another toothbrush kit to address the battery issue. There was no fuss with the troubleshooting on the company's end and it resulted in an extremely happy customer. I never write reviews but I felt like this needed to be shared. Great product. Great customer service. I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
"
"
I was in the market for an electric toothbrush and I found this one after some research so I decided to take the risk. This was such a great buy! This set comes with a handy travel case and the battery lasts forever. This set is such a good value for the price, especially with the extra brush heads. I use the whitening setting most of the time and my teeth are way cleaner than when I was using a manual toothbrush. I highly recommend if you are looking for an alternative from the expensive brands!
"
"
Good item, recommend to buy. My son did some research and found out that this toothbrush is the best in this price range. He loves his new electric toothbrushI ordered one for myself as well.Today my toothbrush arrived, and I already know it is very good
"
"
After many years of using Sonicare I picked this Farywill product for the look and price. My one year old Sonicare broke. I have received this one in the same day and I was actually surprised by the look and accessories presentation. It is a way lighter and slicker product than Sonicare. I am using it for more than 3 weeks now for 3 X a day and, never charged it. The USB cord allows you to charge it anywhere you travel (airplane, laptop, ...). I love this product! My wife is using Sonicare as well but when she felt my new Fairywill toothbrush in her hand, she was convinced! We will order for her, too. The travel case looks also way better than other ""big manes"" products.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush happy with the features the toothbrush offers compare to branded ones in the market. It has 5 modes to clean your tooth; I like the sensitive and the clean mode clean most parts of your teeth with ease compared to a manual brush. The toothbrush comes in a beautiful kit with 7 soft bristles and one inter-dental head for cleaning for braces. Cleans great in and around teeth really well. Overall the product built is a good clean, and comfortable design with easy to charge the battery using a USB charger. I recommend you should try this product once.
"
"
Best clean I have ever had! I am starting to have receding gums from using a standard toothbrush so decided to make the switch to this - I am so happy about this! You will feel like you just left the dentist every time you use this brush. Comes with replacement brushes, power cord, a travel case and a polishing brush. It’s got different settings - sensitive, whitening, polish, etc.
"
"
Cant compare it to firsthand use of fancier models, but it seems to function quite similarly to my spouse's $200 electric toothbrush. Charge lasts a while. Comes with heads, a cable, and a case. Multiple speeds/settings. I love it, it makes orla hygeine less tedious.
"
"
I honestly never liked brushing my teeth before using this toothbrush. Even without toothpaste you can see the work it does at removing plaque and other residues. The 2min cycle divided in 4x 30sec is perfect for kids and teaching them how to clean the entire mouth properly
"
"
Great all around quality, very good value, just missing the option to buy toothbrushes for sensitive gums, they only have medium brushes, they do have a sensitive mode but a soft toothbrush option would make this kit the best one out there for the price
"
"
This electric toothbrush by Fairywill is a well designed and well-featured toothbrush. Starting with the essentials, it has various vibration modes which cater to various dental needs- these vibrations can be set to suit the magnitude at which you would like the vibrations and the frequency through it's different modes.The 8 brush heads ensure that this product will last you for a long time, as it's recommended to change a general brush every 3 months or so, if you do the math, 8 X 3= 24 months, meaning that the brush heads themselves should last you 2 years!Overall, a great product for a fair price.

My experience is positive as it a great device. Used for a couple of months have no complaints. The kit comes with some brush heads which enough to last for at least 6-8 months without spending any money.  Good value item I ever bought.
"
"
This is my very first electric toothbrush and it did not disappoint me. I’ve been using it for almost 2 weeks now and I feel my mouth cleaner and breath fresher. I like that it has a timer and does a lot more work than just cleaning. I also like that it comes with several brush heads and a travel case. Battery also lasts very long. The size of the brush head is also just right.I also noticed whiter teeth.  I just wish it tells me when I’m brushing too intense.  I recommend this product!
"
"
If this is your first electric toothbrush, you might think it’s great, but my last two brushes were the big name sonic ones, and compared to this those, this brush just doesn’t cut it. It’s just not powerful enough. It leaves you doing all the work. A good sonic brush does the work, and you simply move it around. This brush basically just vibrates. The two stars I gave it were for the excellent packaging and presentation.
"
"
Clearly very well made and manufactured.  It took me a couple days to get used to the tingling induced by the vibration of this toothbrush (as compared to my previous Oral-B rotating head),  But one gets used to it.Recommended.
"
"
Had other electric toothbrushes before. But like the fairywill sonic electric model the best. The twist off head is an excellent design. The brush heads are excellent especially the inter dental orthodontic cleaning head.
"
"
I can say my teeth are hardly white, maybe on the front teeth, but every time I get the results from my dentist, it’s just ok,not great. This toothbrush has 5 settings, which I’m still searching for my top pick- took me a while to figure how to change it, but you really do feel the difference. I now have the desire  to floss ! Plus I compared this toothpaste to the kind-Phillips, exact same type of settings, but they’re way more $$$.Thanks.
"
"
My teeth always feel so clean! Currently trying to convince my boyfriend to get one. I love the different settings, auto timer to switch sides, usb charging capability and mine came with 7 brush heads!!! Totally worth the price.
"
"
J’ai acheté ce produit et je l’ai tellement aimé que j’en ai acheté un autre pour mon mari.  Ce produit est d’excellente qualité et la brosse se recharge environs une fois au 2 mois.  Je vous le recommande fortement.
"
"
Pleasantly surprised by how well this toothbrush works. The toothbrush arrived already charged and have yet to have to plug this baby in. I have tried all the functions and switch between the different settings to mix it up.  I have to say that this brush works better than another brand I have been using. Definitely would buy this again.
"
"
Great product.  I didn't realize how much I was going to enjoy the lithium battery that only needs to be charged once a month!  The other tooth brush I owned had a charger that clutters the countertop around the sink and then it gets all cruddy and filthy.
"
"
Very nice electric toothbrush, used it for over a week without needing a charge, comes with a few heads and a tiny brush tools, and the case , very nice, great for traveling, my teeth feel so smooth now, very powerful, clean well.
"
"
Good toothbrush!Love the case but kinda annoying to have to take the head off the toothbrush to fit it in. All the extra heads that comes with it is awesome - well worth the money. I've only had it a couple days so I cant really speak on the battery life or longevity of this product. From what I've seen - it's worth the money! My teeth feel so clean!
"
"
I’ve wanted a electric toothbrush for awhile but their always so expensive.  But this one is bang for your buck.  It comes with extra brush heads. It has the timer for when you’re brushing your teeth. It comes with soft and hard toothbrush heads. I’d definitely recommend this one.
"
"
I love this product, but I find it too bad that they don’t sell the brush head on prime - it’s only 3rd party seller - and it’s expensive when you compare with the price of the brush (which comes with a couple of brushes already)
"
"
Nice toothbrush, i already have another by a different brand but what i like about this it has many options, to play with, and it maddages the gums, i like the fact otncomes with a small box, i can take it with me when i travel
"
"
I bought this product 2 months ago and now it wont charge. I ha e no way of contacting the seller to discuss this problem. So I bought 2 of these so I figure it's a 50/50 buying thisWhat a waste of money
"
"
Nice product. Time will tell how the battery lasts. Nice package. Lots of tips. Happy with purchase. Bought some for the kids too.Update: It’s been a month since purchase. This is a nice brush! I’ve only charged it once since opening. Powerful vibrations. Highly recommended
"
"
I just fell in love with this product. Honestly when i saw the price i was thinking the worse happens I'll brush my jewelry With if I don't like it. But then holy cow i ordered this for my whole family . Obviously it'll be amazing to have more choices than black in the same amount of head and with the case so we have one favourite colour each but i am very very happy.
"
"
My first electric tooth brush and I can’t believe I didn’t get one for so long. Love the 2 min timer and 30second pause as it allows you to focus on each section of your teeth in 4 intervals. Battery life’s amazing - lasts over a week before it’s next charge.
"
"
The battery life is outstanding. I use the toothbrush  3 times a day and the charge lasted over 1 month! The different speeds are easy to set. Lots of extra brushes. looks very nice and of good quality. Now ordering for the rest of the family. Great value.
"
"
I have only had my Fairywell electric toothbrush for a short time. So, far it has been great.It nicely designed and easy to use. I like it comes with a case and a multiple of various types of brushes.A great value and price.
"
"
Love it. My only complaints are that the brush cover doesn’t fit on brush while in case and I wish they had a space for the small pinch brush in the case also. Other than those minor things this toothbrush is great. I got it expecting and ok toothbrush but so far it has really done a great job and I was surprised and the quality for the price.  If I lost it I’d buy another.
"
"
I love this product. I switched from a non-electric toothbrush and I love everything about this toothbrush. I don't use most of the modes but it works for my needs. The head is a tad bit small. I love the 2-minute feature with a pause every 30s to let me know to do a different section of my mouth. A small but greatly appreciated feature is the carrying case it comes with, making it easy if I need to take it for any trips.
"
"
After using it for a week, I can ensure the service is similar to the high end brands. It also comes with a travel case for quick storage. The sonic vibrations leaves your clean teeth, with multi options --> different levels of intensity. Only downside is that it doesn't come with a charging stand.
"
"
I’ve been using a Sonicare for the last few years, but the brush heads are so expensive and I just couldn’t justify the cost anymore, so I started looking for a more affordable replacement without skimping on quality. This is it and I feel like it cleans my teeth even better than my Sonicare did.
"
"
Product arrived fast, great packaging, looks nice (black)could be hard to get replacement heads (different looking) came with pick attachment, carrying case and 6 tooth brush heads. Multiple brushing options.
"
"
This is a really good electric toothbrush so why pay more ?  You get everything you need including a nice travel case and a USB cord for charging. The brush heads do a very good job of cleaning your teeth. I noticed a difference in the white level of my teeth after just a few days. I bought one for my daughter also and will order another one for my wife. I highly recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
Works great. Strong vibrations on default setting but it can be lowered. Only wish the brushes included were larger because the ones it comes with seem more suitable for a Child but it still does the job
"
"
This toothbrush is great, used it for the first time today. Very noticeable difference between old electric tooth brush, my teeth feel like i just came back from the dentist! Great value for this tooth brush seeing how other ""sonic"" tooth brushes are $100-$200. Very pleased, highly recomend.
"
"
Lovely product! Comes with so many toothbrush heads that will last a long time. Sleek design and comes with a travel friendly case.The battery on this is really good too. I’ve been using it for over 2 weeks and I didn’t have to recharge it. For the price, I’d recommend this product to everyone!
"
"
It's really strong, very powerfull, it also has a supporting amount of extra heads, and a carying case. It has 5 different modes . It's not heavy, but it's not light either
"
"
Je l adore de loin la meilleure que j ai acheté, elle est arrivé avec trois brosse supplementaire vraiment satisfaite je la recommande escellebr choix
"
"
The power of this toothbrush is beyond what I was expecting. It has a bunch of great quality of life improvements over a standard electric toothbrush. I don’t think there’s another brush on the market of this quality for the price.
"
"
Toothbrush  is great so far!  Just wish it  came with color coded heads for entire family. The advertisement showed different  colors.  So just a heads up if you are buying for that reason.  Great product  and company was incredible to deal with. Id reccomend!
"
"
J'aime bien ce produit. Ca fait quelques temps que j'utilise ce brosse à dent et jusqu'a maintenant je suis bien stisfaite pour le moment. Merci
"
"
I bit less powerful than my previous Philips brush but it I still give 5 stars to it.The only thing you may not like is that you can't buy the replacement brushes, at least I could not find any on Amazon, you'll probably have to throw it after the kit brushes are out of use.
"
"
I received this product yesterday and try it this morning.It works very well. It is really great to receive 8 heads since it is advisable to change them every 3 months. This kit is therefore made for 2 years. For the price it's really good value. I recommand it.
"
"
Great value , looks really sharp too. Battery life is great ...going on 4 weeks charge. A stand would have been the only thing I can think of.
"
"
This is the best electric toothbrush I have ever used. It's worth every penny, although it's really affordable for a high quality product. I will buy another one for my boyfriend. 100% recommended.
"
"
I've only had this for a few months now but I'm pretty amazed with it. It's my first electric toothbrush so I have little to compare it with. That being said, I love the design. I love how it charges (though it lasts for about a month!). It's a great product and I'm impressed. Highly recommended.
"
"
Wasn’t sure what to expect for a 40 dollar electric tooth brush- I was happily surprised! Works well. Had for about a week now and my teeth look a shade whiter already. Never used an electric tooth brush before so can’t say how it compares to others, but overall feel like it was a good purchase.
"
"
Great so far, works like what it’s intended. I’ve only had it for a few days.... I’ll be giving a other review at a later date.
"
"
Pour le prix la qualité global du produit est très bonne. Tres pratique pour le déplacement chargement usb.Vient avec beaucoup de brosses (qui sont souvent dans les autres marques tres chers, ici non).Le plastique semble solide.Recommandé
"
"
Amazing tooth brush! Great value for the price. Does a great job cleaning my teeth and way better than your average brush. Professional results with an affordable price :) super happy with this purchase
"
"
This tooth brush goes where no other toothbrush has gone..Missing back teeth no problem as this toothbrush gets everywhere..The different setting all stimulate in their own way. .I am a senior and can honestly say This is by for the best toothbrush I have ever used...
"
"
I have never used an electronic toothbrush. I ordered this one and I must I'm quite satisfied with my purchase. The package arrive within 2 days. It has 7 brushes and 1 polisher, it has 5 modes to use with a timer. Totally worth of money and I would totally recommend it to friends and family.
"
"
Really like the bristles they are super soft. They make your gums tingle too which I’m not sure if it’s good or bad but you get used to it after awhile.
"
"
These brushes are amazing! I bought 3, 2 for my kids 1 for tje hubby, they are just as good as any brand name ones out there. The extra heads are the best part.
"
"
Very well designed. Using vibration to remove plaque and junk off your teeth. the battery life is excellent. Very happy after a month of usage. Love the extra head to go into the hard to reach spaces between teeth.
"
"
Bouhht 2, one for me and one for my bf. We both love the look and they work well. I brush 2-3 times a day and havent needed to charge it in 2 months. Highly recommended
"
"
Easy to use and it comes with hard case so its also very easy to carry during travelling. Battery is long lasting. All 5 modes are very different from each other and they work very well.
"
"
It is better then a normal toothbrush but nothing like a sonicare. For the price I’m happy, it still gets the job done. Replacement heads are cheaper too.
"
"
Amazing product! So light weight and makes my teeth feel so clean. I love how chic it looks aswell and the travel case is so handy! Would highly recommend this product! Already recommended it to my mum and aunt aswell and now they both purchased one!
"
"
THE 2 MINUTES SMART TIMER, 8 BRUSH HEADS and THE LONG BATTERY LIFE are bright spots for this toothbrush. At the beginning I was not used to the buzzing sound, after one week, I get used to it and really like it. It worth to have.
"
"
Just got it not sure about battery life but great price with all these extra head and awesome to have a traveling case
"
"
I have been searching for a second toothbrush and I must say I am super impressed with this product. Inexpensive and works amazing for giving your teeth that just cleaned from the dentist feel.
"
"
The  customer service department at Fairywill  is the most empowered and responsive organization that I have ever done business with. My issues were immediately responded to and resolved to a HIGH LEVEL of satisfaction. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FAIRYWILL AND THEIR PRODUCT LINE.
"
"
the brush is very soft and very easy to use. Even my 3 years old daughter likes to brush her teeth with this electric brush !
"
"
At difference of the other products it come with an universal USB charger, so no matter where you are it can be recharge (110-220 v, in a plane or a car).The owner sent me a email to know how to improve the use.
"
"
highly reccomend this toothbrush !The charge life is a long time.Very nice small travelling case for your toothbrush you just have to take the head off to toothbrush for it to fit in the travelling case.My teeth feel nice and clean and white😃
"
"
It actually works well!Good selection of featuresAnd multiple brush heads!
"
"
This Electric Toothbrush is a great value for your money! It works better than the more expensive name brands that I have had before. It has several modes to choose from and looks very nice!
"
"
I bought this for my son who’s 4, he’s had no trouble brushing his teeth, the settings are easy to move though, I will be replacing toothbrushes for our family with the fairywill. The battery lasts, comes with several heads for replacement. Love the product!
"
"
great product.lots of brush heads and travel case, which look great.brush seems to work fine
"
"
We love this product it is amazing it make sure of the mouth feels so clean and it cleans your teeth so well
"
"
Saw this toothbrush and thought it would be great for travelling.  Compact and light, comes with a case. Would recommend.
"
"
Sleek design, lightweight.It did the a good job on my teeth the first try.
"
"
The kids love using it. It's been over a month and still running on the initial charge.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush! Love the multiple settings, battery lasts a long time! My teeth feel so clean afterwards, so happy with this purchase! Would highly recommend!
"
"
Great product, long battery life. Bought it a month ago and still have not charged it, use it twice a day. Love the 2 min timer keeps you in check. Have recommended this product to family and friends.
"
"
So many benefits and functions. Definitely worth the purchase! I highly recommend.
"
"
At first found the quality of the product little cheap, especially there is no cover to protect the charge port at the bottom of the toothbrush. But after few usage, the toothbrush cleans my teeth better than the Soniccare. So for the price, I think is a excellent buy.
"
"
I love this electric tooth brush. Only one down fall......The way it recharges. I expected to plug it into the wall....not my computer. Otherwise it is great.
"
"
Premium product for an amazing price. Teeth feel dentist clean after each use
"
"
It works very well, my teeth are so clean right now that unfortunately I cannot feel the food's taste like before. Its’s odd.
"
"
charge lasts a long time, and great that its charged not battery operated.
"
"
Very happy with this purchase! Couldn’t really ask for a better toothbrush. It does a great job, I love the numerous settings available, and I feel that it was a fair price to buy. 10/10, would buy it again!
"
"
This toothbrush works just as well or better than the more expensive options from the bigger brands. Great product.
"
"
Brush teeth have never been so easy and it also require less effort, 2 mins go faster.
"
"
Better than the big brand ones I have used. Highly recommend it to anyone 😊
"
"
Great quality for a decent price.  Great compact travel kit.
"
"
Awesome product. Every time I feel like I just left the Dentist Office for a cleanup.
"
"
Amazing product. Leave my teeth nice and clean. Only been using for 3 days but can say, it cleans very good leaving teeth squeaky clean!...
"
"
Very impressed with the product...but wondering why there was no charger included.. How long can it hold a charge, and then, what do I do.  I am a senior Senior, and do not find it easy to deal with technical matters...Thank you.
"
"
A good vibration easy on the gum very effective cleaning happy with the product.
"
"
My son had had this toothbrush for 2 months now and hasn’t needed to charge it yet. Great quality. He loves it!
"
"
Love this electric toothbrushSo many amazing options such as whiteningVery lightweightDefinitely recommend
"
"
I was using it for a month or so.. Really like it. Battery is still working since I unpacked it. Very light weight, nice design, 5 different modes. So far I am very happy with this toothbrush. Thanks!
"
"
Product arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  Great value.  Toothbrush is light-weight and comes with a travel case.  The bonus was the extra toothbrush heads that were included.  I would buy another one.
"
"
My daughter and I use this brush and our teeth have never been cleaner. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking into buying an electric toothbrush!
"
"
Like it so far timer and functions are great, have sensitive teeth so I like that function.
"
"
Great value , excellent brushing machine at a great price
"
"
Awesome product only wish the brushes were bigger
"
"
great price and product is very good.
"
"
Cleans very well, no issues with the power. Charged fully from the box in approx an hour.
"
"
This is a great brush! My Sonicare bit the dust and this was a great alternative! Price is great and came with plenty of replacement heads. Battery lasts a long time!
"
"
This toothbrush was just what I was looking for! So many brushing options, the charge lasts for quite a long time. It comes with a great travel/carrying case! All around great purchase
"
"
Great electric tooth brush and can't beat the price!
"
"
Nice try for this brand, easy to use. It is very light to handle, there has also 5 functions to use. Good battery for use longtime.
"
"
I used it for a week now and I have not charged yet. Feel that my teeth are clean after using it. I find it very neat to have a travel case as I travel often. Thinking of buying for my loved ones!
"
"
Good quality and so quiet. Lots of brush heads. Highly recommend!
"
"
Just got mine. The first time I used it my teeth felt so clean. I can already feel the difference. Will update in a month
"
"
J'adore cette brosse à dent, très belle et fonctionne à merveille
"
"
It’s working really well for me.
"
"
Great quality! Enjoy the timer as well.
"
"
Makes my teeth feel really clean and the battery lasts a long time
"
"
Very happy I got this - the travel case is great too. Already seeing a huge improvement in my teeth. This toothbrush makes you want to brush your teeth as silly as that sounds. It's so easy to do.
"
"
I cannot comment on the battery life because I just receive, but the case will be perfect for travel. It very sleek and would definitely recommend.
"
"
la batterie est deja morte je peux plus la faire confionner :( apres 2 mois ???!? si possible d en envoyer une qui fontionne bien ca serait gentil !!!!
"
"
Love this product so much. I have a tooth causing me a lot of pain and after two days of using this my pain is basically gone. No need to buy the brand name ones, this one is just as good
"
"
Works great.  Love it.
"
"
J’adore ma brosse à dent. Je l’ai depuis un mois et elle est efficace, même pas eu besoin de la recharger encore! À recommander.
"
"
Once you get use to the feeling of the vibration it's the best tooth brush you've ever tried. I've never had cleaner teeth in such a short time. Great value for the money 👍👍
"
"
Elle fonctionne vraiment bienJe suis satisfait la batterie dure très longtemps bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
If you are looking for a very affordable sonic toothbrush, this is what you are looking for. Great price, Great quality.
"
"
Noticed a difference within the first few uses.
"
"
very good. battery life is insane. high quality. recommend 100%
"
"
My thirteen year old loves it. Clean teeth with no complaining parents! Great price and extra toothbrush heads. Recommend.
"
"
Bought as a gift exchange. Didn't use it myself. Box is so much smaller and lighter than expected.
"
"
Kit parfait pour les voyages
"
"
Rapport/ qualité  prix c'est tres avantageux
"
"
Great electric toothbrush. Battery lasts a very long time. It lasts over by a month fully charged. Tickles the mouth at first
"
"
Love the sleek look and carrying case! My only complaint so far is the head feels quite loose when brushing. Other than that I’ve loved the toothbrush
"
"
It's ok
"
"
Ive only had this for 3 days so far but it cleans better then any other toothbrush ive had .  My teeth feel amazing  Love it so far
"
"
Great value, works good.
"
"
Great powered toothbrush for the price
"
"
Have been using this for about a week now. Very convenient and easy to use. Have not needed to charge it yet and comes with lots of brush heads!
"
"
It worked ok out of the box, but has not been able to charge to full capacity so it is a very weak vibration. Absolute waste of money.
"
"
I haven't had a lot of time to use it. But it seems to do the trick so far.
"
"
Mes dents sont presque aussi propres qu’à la sortie du dentiste. Elles sont super lisses. Très contente de mon achat
"
"
Good Brush  tickles the mouth a bit at first  but after a week or so you don't even feel it
"
"
Correct
"
"
Excellent!!!. Have been using it for the past year and my wife wanted one too, so this one is for her and she loves it.
"
"
Excellente brosse. L'étuit de transport est très pratique.
"
"
perfect
"
"
I like the different options in speed
"
"
Very good
"
"
As soon as you take it out of the box you notice it is a cheap quality toothbrush. The build feels cheap but it does the job and is worth the price.
"
"
Really great, not too loud and I have been using it for about 2 or 3 weeks now without having to charge it
"
"
satisfait de mon achat
"
"
Love this toothbrush.. it is so easy to travel with and just as described, I love the timed settings~would re purchase.
"
"
All the thing is good but the brush is too hard. If your teeth are sensitive I reccommend you buy another brush which is more soft than this one
"
"
So far so good. I like the different settings to suite your taste. Battery life is really good so far. Very satisfied
"
"
Absolutely love it with zero complaints. Highly recommend.
"
"
Everything is as advertised.It does its job and it does it well.Happy with the product so far.
"
"

If you're looking for an electric toothbrush you'll quickly realize how overly expensive they are. When I bought this I wasn't expecting a miracle tool, but didn't want to spend over $100 on a toothbrush. However, this has totally exceeded my expectations! I've been using this brush for almost 6 months and I've charged it maybe 3 times! The brush itself has a nice sleek look with 5 different modes (I prefer the clean and polish one) and it's very easy to change the brush head. All in all, this is so worth your money, I really am impressed.
"
"
Love this product.  Like the squeaky clean feeling after every time I brush my teeth.
"
"
Vraiment génial ! Marche très bien et la batterie tiens longtemps :)
"
"
Love this toothbrush. High quality, beautiful design and I love the easy travel case.

I went to charge my battery today and replace the brush head... and I was beyond mortified to find black mold beneath the brush head. I store my brush upright and it is never submerged in water.I would HIGHLY recommend removing the brush head after every single use.The manufacturer should also state this in their care instructions. (Update: The manufacturer emailed me after this comment and stated that they email their customers with care instructions after purchase, however I never received said email).I am choked that I spent near 50 bucks on this toothbrush and have basically been brushing my teeth with black mold for I'm guessing probably a couple weeks now. (Update: the manufacturer did reach out and offer to send me a new toothbrush FOC or issue a refund to rectify the situation which was nice. I am leaving my comment up to let people know that they need to remove the brush head after each use to avoid mold growth... since it is not stated anywhere in the manual)Also adding in that the whitening feature is misleading as it is just a different speed of vibration.
"
"
Was so excited when I revived my toothbrush, does really clean your teeth better then a manual brush. However, I was extremely disappointed that my the charger that came does not charge the tooth brush so now I have this amazing toothbrush that won’t charge and I can’t enjoy.
"
"
Cuts out intermittently. Then just turns off. Thought it might need a charge. Charged it. Still cuts out intermittently and just shuts off.Needs on/off switch. That's it. I want to brush my teeth for 20 minutes straight if I so desire. This tells YOU, the customer, the owner of the product, how long, and even when to change sections of your mouth. It must be for children. I have never once in my life forgotten to brush a 'section' of my mouth without a warning. This product could be FLAWLESS. Give an option for timer, because it is the most unnecessary feature on a product I have ever purchased. Sure it is easy to turn it on again. You know what's even easier? An on/off switch.
"
"
I am not at all pleased with the product. I had a Philips Sonicare that finally died on me a few weeks ago. I found this product to be far less effective in actually cleaning the teeth, and found no difference in the various settings, ie no difference in the sensitive, vs the clean, vs the whiting, etc. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!! This review is on the Model: FW-507. After writing this review I was contacted and sent a new model of the Fairywill electric toothbrush, A P11, and it works much better than the FW-507. I was asked to change my original review which I will not do as it is still a valid review on the original PW-507 toothbrush.
"

For the price you pay, it comes with an abundance of accessories -- the extra brush heads and the travel case are particularly welcome. But the designers tried to do too much by adding too many settings to this brush and making it too difficult to operate. For example, the regular setting, which most people would use, is not the default setting. Instead, you have put the toothpaste on the brush head, put in your mouth, power it on and then using your peripheral vision try and click it the right setting before you start brushing. Not easy to do. You should be able just to switch it on and start using it. You may like this system, especially at this price point, but I don't and I'm returning it.
"

Purchased this item and it was working fine until it stopped vibrating at 5 month mark (even the power lights and option lights seem to work fine.....). I did not reach out to the company for this issue but did leave a review on Amazon. Few weeks later, the company reached out to me and offer solution options to fix my problem as the product comes with 1-year warranty. I gladly choose to receive a newer version of Fairywell (P11). After using P11 for couple of weeks, I think P11 is even better and well-worth the additional 10CAD over this model. If you are prone to deposit, P11 version clean it very gentle (gentle enough for pregnancy women like me) and very effective. I am impressed.
"
"
Worked great for exactly 2 days and then it just stopped. Like stopped. I thought it's the battery, but after charging for 4-6-8 hours, it still won't start. No water damage or anything. It just stopped and I'm furious.
"

I purchased the toothbrush with the traveling case. I am a frequent traveler​ for work and found the traveling case to be perfect for my situation as the case is very small and allows me to take off the toothbrush head to minimize the length of the toothbrush. The travel case is made out of plastic so no worries if it gets wet and remains closed with the help of magnets. Just like the travel case, the toothbrush is also waterproof! The travel case is not large enough to fit the charging cord for the toothbrush but that shouldn’t be a problem as I have been able to use the toothbrush for at least a month before having to charge again which only takes few hours. I just let it charge overnight and use it again in the morning. The charging cable requires a USB adapter to charge. I am very impressed with how much supply is provided with my purchase as I had a total of seven toothbrush heads. Each head is wrapped in plastic to ensure cleanliness before usage. There is a total of five modes, white, clean, sensitive, polish and massage. The toothbrush will remember your most recent mode and continue to use that mode the next time you brush your teeth so you don’t have to spam click the power button to get to your desired mode. With this being said, you only have to click the power button (the only button on the toothbrush) to switch between the different modes. The overall build quality is very impressive as fairly lightweight and has a premium feel in my hands.  This toothbrush is an item with a very good presentation and good for gifting. The experience of opening this toothbrush was very pleasant and very much enjoyed as the box is high quality and everything is individually wrapped. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a toothbrush upgrade or purchasing it as a gift for someone.

I was hoping to buy a decent electric toothbrush because I tend to brush too hard with a regular toothbrush.  This brush feels like a fancy expensive toothbrush at a great price point.There are different modes to swap between, my gums were almost 'ticklish' when I first started using the brush so the sensitive mode helped.  Battery lasts forever, haven't had to charge it yet and it's been over a week of use.  If I put too much pressure on the brush it pauses so I know if I'm pushing on the brush too hard.Fellow Invisalign users! This is perfect for cleaning your trays thoroughly and quickly. The brush head is small enough to navigate through the trays.I am Indian so I eat a lot of spices and drink a lot of tea and have noticed much less staining on my teeth after using thisHappy with my purchase :)

I tried this toothbrush as my first electric toothbrush because I didn't want to spend lot of money to name brands. After using this for a one-week duration I realize how versatile this electric gadget and how important this for my busy life.The powerful toothbrush does its duty within 2 minutes' time and during brushing, it gives a reminder to change location intermittently.Medium soft brush heads clean my tooth without any harm to oral mucosa and gums. It is waterproof and can use while in a bath. Battery life is excellent and after fist charge, I use this for seven days and still it is life.It came with eight brush heads and eye-catching travel case.I really love my new electric toothbrush and will definitely rate this five stars.

I've received the toothbrush on April 17th, fully charged the battery (took maybe an hour, so the battery wasn't full when I received the toothbrush, but near). The battery died on May 31st. I brush 3 times a day for the full 2 minutes. The battery life sure is impressing.The multiple modes are... kinda pointless, you'll settle for one and keep it that way. The brush remembers the setting it finished on, so you never have to change it, which is pretty sweet.There are 2 things that kind of annoy me:1. The indicator if the battery is going to die (that apparently flashes?) is where your hand is when brushing, so it's impossible to see while brushing, when I came up to brush my teeth the brush just didn't turn on and I had no idea why (other than it been over a month and a half without charging). I wish the indication for an almost dead battery would be done differently (e.g.: when the 2-minutes timer is over, the brush could vibrate a few times)2. The 2-minutes timer is absolute. Once you reach 2 minutes, the toothbrush turns off. This is both nice and annoying. It's nice because you know you've done the 2 minutes and your teeth should be clean. It's annoying because sometimes I wish I could spend a little more time on a few spots I feel aren't clean enough. This is my first eletric toothbrush, so it might be because I'm not used to this. I'm slowly getting less annoyed by that, but still I wish I could have a way to add an extra 30 seconds.But for the price, damn this is a good buy.

I have been using an electric spinning tooth brush for the last two decades.  That toothbrush cost about $9 and that has a good speed.After I saw a YouTube video that compared inbuilt charcoal tooth brush, electric rotary toothbrush and a sonic toothbrush on a dirty up corn., I was amazed at how the sonic brush cleaned up the corn section.  Was cleared of the debris and that section was actually shining.So I looked and got this sonic electric toothbrush.  I was pleasantly surprised in how my teeth felt after spending two minutes on each section of my upper and lower teeth.  My teeth felt smooth and slippery - in a good way.  My rotary toothbrush doesn't give me that feeling.For sure, one has to put toothpaste on the brush before pressing the on button.  It is hard to select a mode while I was brushing.  I really have to remember where the desired mode, like one press, two press, three press, etc.One thing I didn't like about the packaging is that on the advertisement, you get eight brush heads.  That included the in-between cleaning head.  BUT in the packaging, the in-between cleaning head is offered as a ""gift"".Overall, I found the brushing helpful.  This will stay as an additional step to clean my teeth - for the rest of my life. :-D

I've been using this electric toothbrush for a few weeks now and there are a few things that are good and bad about this toothbrush. I'll start with the good. It's amazing how this tooth brush comes with so many replacement heads that I'm sure it'll last me for a few years. It even comes with a carrying/travel case for easy storage and convenient for me to take everywhere. The battery life on this thing is also phenomenal, I haven't charged it every since I got it and I have been using it for a few weeks now and the power still seems to be running well. Speaking of power, the vibration and the power is also quite strong, not too strong that it'll hurt you and not too weak that it won't clean. It also has a flat bottom so I can easily store it and put it on my sink counter. Now the bad part. The head of the tooth brush seems a bit too small for my liking and I'm not used to having such a small head so it feels like I can't get my teeth as clean as having a bigger head. Another thing is that it has a lot of different modes, but all the modes seems like it's the same and the manual doesn't really explain what the different modes are for and when to use them. I've also realized that the vibration is on a timer for optimal cleaning, but again, the manual also doesn't explain how the timer works and when to switch teeth. So I think they should update the manual or provide explanation somewhere to explain all the cool function it has. Overall, it's a really good value electric toothbrush for your money, and you won't regret buying it

I have tried a three different Panasonic Ultrasonic models in the past and I had varying success of them working until they died between 9 months-2 years later. I have tried an Oral B electric brush but didn’t like the way it felt but this is an inexpensive alternative. It feels like the Panasonic in almost every way but I’ve had it for a month and haven’t had to charge it yet whereas I used to have to charge the Panasonic every 3-4 days which required bringing a charger for any trip longer than a weekend and it was less than $50 for the brush and enough heads to last two years. What I will say for the Panasonic is that it felt like it was more powerful than the Fairywell. I am happy with this brush and it saves so much money compared to buying a new Panasonic model every year.
"
"
Before I got this brush my teeth were black mud. Now after few days of using it, my teeth are whiter than  milk. What an amazing master piece. I'd write more but women are calling me from foreign countries to date me and I have to get ready.On serious note, I switched from an mid-range Oral-B brush to to this and I must say I am incredibly pleased. I don't know what it is about this brush, but I just enjoy using it more than I did with my Oral-B and my teeth feel great.If you enjoyed this review and found it helpful, it would be awesome if you hit the ""Yes/Helpful"" button below! :)
"
"
So far so good. I wish the case had a stronger magnet or clasp on it, but it’s a great addition. The 2 minute timer with 30 second intervals really helps me know that I’m spending enough time on each quadrant of teeth. I don’t know what other sonic brushes feel like, so it’s hard to rate. It doesn’t feel like it’s doing much, but that could be normal. I prefer it to my old spin brush that caused toothpaste and water to fly everywhere. With so many replacement brushes, this package is a good value. I hope that my dentist will notice a difference in my teeth and gums at my next appointment.
"
"
I bought one for my son (great for cleaning his braces).The toothbrush head vibrates and the top bristles move back and forth faster. There are different ‘modes’, but  I found they are more speeds than anything!But the fact that it comes with so many replacement heads and a polisher head is an amazing value and worth your money!It also comes with a nice travel case and it charges well.So I bought a second one for my daughter and she loves it! She actually brushes her teeth longer and sometimes 4 times a day lol
"
"
What a surprise. Everyone said go with oral B, but after doing a lot of research on effectiveness and ‘cost of use’ analysis, this came out as a top value purchase.  Holds the charge amazingly long. After a month of use, it finally needed a charge. Simple to use, it remembers you favorite setting. Works well and yes, your teeth get whiter than using a regular toothbrush. Travel case is perfect. Highly recommend.
"
"
This electric brush is an excellent value because they give you so many brush heads for free along with it - whereas you often have to buy extra heads later on with other products.It looks very sleek and beautiful in addition which is a plus.The ultrasonic action is very nice and it is known to remove more bacteria and plaque from teeth than regular brushing.  On the whole its a well made product
"
"
This kit has everything I needed, many brush head to be use for a very long time and an attractive color (Black) and easy to use function. I only charge it 1 time for now and it still work fine. The 5 modes are great but pretty much does the same thing, I prefer the third one for my sensitive teeth. This toothbrush is a little bit smaller than the other one I have owned and it came with a practical travel box.
"
"
...compared to bigger names in the market. But I was pleasantly surprised. It is quiet, light, and one charge lasts for roughly three weeks. They care about their customers! It shows in the quality and in all the accessories.This product is by far (imho) much better than more expensive alternatives.USB charging is a great feature when you travel (which I do a lot)
"
"
I liked this one as it comes with spare replacement heads that can be used by multiple persons in the house with safe matter and less money, comes with 7 spare brushes head in an awesome package and a strong cover for the brush. I really liked the indictor lights and i has various modes such as  strong for white teath and soft or sensitive for the people like me
"
"
Battery last very long as I haven't had to recharge it yet after 1 month of using it daily.I was using a waterpik sonic toothbrush before it died so I can compare both. This one feels like it's less strong (less aggressive?) on the teeth but my teeth feel very clean after I use it so I'm happy.
"
"
When I opened the box, I was really impressed with the quality and all the features and extra brushes. I haven’t tried it yet because I am still using my old one for now until the brush is done. I thought that I would order now because it was on sale...lol.So far, I am really happy with the order.  :) Thank you.
"
"
I’m a few weeks in and I really like this toothbrush. The battery life seems good, and I like that every 30 seconds it lets you know to start cleaning the next quadrant of your mouth. I find myself doing the full two minutes all the time and my teeth seem much cleaner. Good value for the price.
"
"
Comes in a great case to bring with me when im travelling or sleeping over at a friends place. Comes with multiple brush heads both soft and firm to your preference making it worth the money paid for. Really like the different modes and the timer to countdown how long to brush.
"
"
We had a similar design toothbrush from a different company. It worked well for couple years and gave up. So we ordered from this company because it looked the same.  It works as expected no issues so far  (about a month of use). In addition, it has a nice case with replacment heads.
"
"
I've always been an oscillating electric guy but this actually is amazing!  Your mouth will actually feel clean after.  Cant beat the value.  Came with like 8 replacement heads. USB charging.  It's awesome!  Thank you again!  Will definitely recommend
"

Tres bien tres tres bonne qualite ,un plus la.brosse est asser longue sa salir le manche je recommande sauf qui donne une garantie de 6 mois supplenentaire et a l enregistrement ont recois pas de retour .mais si sa brise pas ont en as pas besoin
"
"
à première vue en ouvrant j'ai eu peur, car elle est toute petite, mais après l'avoir essayé je suis ravielle est puissante et pratique. Différent mode de brossage et une minuterieSuper coolbon achat que je recommande
"
"
it took me a minute to get used to i had never used an electric brush as an adult so the buzzing sound threw me off however now im obsessed. i use it twice a day everyday so its cool that it comes with extra heads. would purchase again.
"
"
I have been using it for a while now and like everything about it except it will just cut out during use and start back up. Only lasts for a second but still wierd. Have contacted Fairywill and will see what their response is.
"
"
My dentist told me i should switch to a sonic toothbrush.i found this one on amazon for much less than the other big brands.this toothbrush has tons of great features like times and extra brush heads.
"
"
Overall good value for money.  I don't think it cleans my teeth as well as I would like.  The charge lasts a long time and the unit is easy to clean.  It has different functions but I only use the 2 minute clean cycle.
"
"
Not too impressed.Brush head for tiny teeth, not adult.No medium brushes available. You get soft,Packs do not say if soft or medium, hard.Probably will return
"
"
I love it, the price is incredible and it does the job like the most expensive ones do. I had an expensive one before and when it broke I chose this one, very happy with the decision
"
"
I ordered this for my husband. So far he’s really happy with it. He said he likes having different mode options and likes the case it came with. Its nice it came with so many extra toothbrush heads.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush. Powerful and effective. Comes with a bunch of head replacements, a great case, and even a little plastic cover for the brush head. Love it.
"
"
I really like this brush set , its a great deal and  the brush stays charged for  weeks. the heads are nice and soft . I've had no issues as of yet !
"
"
Only had it a few days but so far so good.Various settings are great and brush itself seems of good quality.Really cleans and shines beautifully.Very satisfied and highly recommend for the feel and look of a good hygienist-like cleaning.
"
"
Always wanted a sonic toothbrush and couldn’t pass it up for this price.Works excellent and build quality is very nice.I like the clean feeling after every brush.I recommend it.
"
"
Just got my toothbrush today and I was so excited to try it out. I was BLOWN AWAY at how amazing this toothbrush is! I love all the function options and this toothbrush has done such a great job on my teeth and getting rid of plaque. I very very highly recommend this product!!!!

Works well. extra brushes are wonderful. Long battery life. Great for travel.

Initial battery life when I first used it lasted for a month and the travelling case is a welcome bonus.

Love it. Easy to use, easy to assemble, powerful.  Battery lasts forever.
"
"
 It is technically an electric toothbrush, it does vibrate a bit. Doesn't feel like the vibration is doing anything though. It's not intense enough to remove anything more than a normal manual brushing would.
"
"
clean most of the areas, only thing which i didnt like is the battery power.Battery didnt last long, but with the price, its worth for the money
"
"
I love this toothbrush, it's great and disposable... Just what I was looking for! I love the thinner floss tips to get in between my teeth and leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean! 😁👌🏻
"
"
I am glad to have learned that tooth-brushing can be this simple and effective.But angry that I took so long!This brush cleans your teeth almost the same as a dental hygienist.In between the teeth feels smooth, and it is light and simple and unobtrusive and compact.Excellent value for money!
"
"
I have used this brand of toothbrush before and love it.  An electric toothbrush was just a bit too severe for my permanent bridges but the Sonic Power toothbrush does the job well.
"
"
Not a great brush. It just vibrates not a motorised one. Ocerall not bad experience.. But, it seems a rotating brush in picture
"
"
Great deal on this set. Will definitely purchase again.My teeth feel amazing and I don’t feel the need to put pressure on my brush when brushing now. It’s amazing.

I am a little bit surprised that the inexpensive power feature seems to work.

Such an amazing price for a decent entry level motorized Toothbrush.  Really feels comfortable.  Good for a kids primary and traveling adults, (not adults primary).  Sleek design blends into existing decor.  Highly recommended and impressed with the value!

My regular brush is a sonic rechargeable one, with a small head and a powerful strength.My review is based on a comparison between the one I use and a product on the subject.Pros:- Great bristles, clean thoroughly and getting deep between the teeth.- The tang cleaner does the job.- 1 AAA battery is included.Cons:- Batteries powered - it requires 1 AAA battery. I prefer rechargeable versions.- The brush's body is short, and its surface is somewhat slippery when wet. I have rheumatoid arthritis, and using the brush caused me a pain in hand.- The head of the brush is longer and wider than my regular brush's head, and the size caused me several times a laryngospasm.Note:The manufacturer's description of the product on Amazon's page says:- The brush has a replaceable head - it is not replaceable- It requires 2 AAA batteries.But the model on the subject, Colgate 360 Sonic Power Toothbrush,  powered by 1 AAA battery.
"
"
===INTRODUCTION===I had the opportunity to review the 'Colgate Sonic Power Toothbrush w/Floss Tip' for 1 week.Included in my review is my experience with the product over the course of the above time line (3 brushes per day, x7 days).===PROS +===+Ergonomic Grip is Very Comfortable;+Well Designed Bristle (maximum coverage);+Rear Tongue Cleaner;+Battery Included'===CONS -===-Cleaning is Average vs. Higher End Battery/Electric Toothbrushes===CONCLUSION===You only have one set of teeth - once they fail due to poor maintenance, that's it - they never regrow! With that being said, you want to overly invest in dental hygiene to ensure that your teeth maintain excellent condition throughout your life.This particular Sonic Power toothbrush provides an average clean and is ideal for using on short trips. In order to save on battery costs, you can purchase rechargeable batteries from Amazon (AmazonBasics are the best value).Overall, if this is a toothbrush you will use on occasion, it's recommended; however, long-term, purchase a high end model to keep your teeth/gums in ideal health.

It has been long time since I have used manual toothbrush since I switched to electric toothbrush long back. Colgate 360 Sonic Power Toothbrush looks like a manual toothbrush, but it is battery operated power toothbrush. It is not as fully featured as even entry level electric toothbrush, but it is better than regular manual toothbrush.At $12 price point for two toothbrush that also includes batteries, they are priced similar to good quality manual toothbrush but with a magic button. You press that button and it activates 20000 sonic strokes per minute. Unlike another Colgate Power Toothbrush I have tried it is not bulky and unergonomic. It feels good in hand.This toothbrush provides decent cleaning performance and I can recommend it to anyone who is on budget and do not want to buy electric toothbrush.If you are thinking to move to electric toothbrush to improve dental hygiene, I would highly recommend to start with ORAL-B 1000 Pro series or Philips Sonicare Protective Clean Series which provides exceptional value at around $50-60 price point and they often go on sale.

I've been using a $300 electronic tooth brush for about 8 months now so when I tried these battery operated brushes I had very low expectations but here's the thing; they work. In fact they work better than my electric one. I feel weird about saying that but if you look at the brush head you'll see how that's possible. The floss tip really does get between my teeth and the yellow rubber bits polish them to a shine. The brush head is much bigger than the one on my electric brush. The vibration is a perfect strength for effectiveness but that may diminish as the included batteries fade (they can be replaced). All of this makes me wonder why Colgate hasn't ventured into the electric rechargeable brush market because these battery powered brushes are awesome. My teeth feel 100% cleaner.My only complaint is that from the front, both brushes in this 2 pack look nearly identicle and I worry that my son will confuse the two and end up accidentally using mine.For the price of some electric brushes, you could buy a life time supply of these. I think it's a no-brainer, these brushes are an awesome buy.

This is one that both my husband and I like to throw into our travel bag and for the short trips  as for the cost it does not matter if we forget them, break them or loose them. They do an ok job at cleaning better then a manual toothbrush but no where near that of a higher end brush. The feel in your hand is nice it is comfortable to hold and the bristles are soft and do give you a nice coverage when you are brushing. Over all it I think it is a good brush to travel with or to start your journey in to electric toothbrushes but save up and buy a higher end one and just throw tis one in your travel kit.
"
"
I was really surprised to see how strong this toothbrush was. I've used 300$+ electric toothbrushes and this one does a great job for the price. It has the normal toothbrush head, not the skinny flat or minuscule round head of the regular electric toothbrushes.  It's more ergonomic for your teeth and mouth.This one was the ""soft"" one, but it's a little on the stiff side; I prefer super soft toothbrushes but they are very rare.The toothbrushes in your pack have batteries included.The price is awesome; at 11.97$ and the amazon coupon of 1.25$, comes down to 5.26$ each brush
"

I like this 2-pack of electric toothbrushes from Colgate for travel. One for me, one for my wife. Keep them in our luggage, use them until the battery dies, then replace them. They're a little better than a completely manual toothbrush, but they don't compare to my high-end Philips rechargeable toothbrush that I use at home. For the price and my purposes, they're worth it.
"
"
For the price, I am unsure if this can be beaten. At about 6 dollars a tooth brush, that is very good value. As a toothbrush this works quite well, probably on par with a manual tooth brush in this price range. The bristles are very soft on your teeth, and do a great job of getting around your gums.
"
"
I have always been a fan of Colgate toothbrushes, and these Colgate 360 Sonic Power Toothbrushes are no exception. They have a very nice shaped head and leave your mouth feeling clean. It cleans all areas of the mouth. I highly recommend and would definitely buy these again.

 Got this as a gift from my sister. Its good for traveling. Comes as a pair.

Amazing. I love them. Best value for the price

Good quality tooth brush with some rattle action going on.  Looks nice too
"

Amazing tooth  brush, I do recommend persons to use it.
"

Excellent value for money here. While not a true rotating toothbrush, this works very well and feels a lot better than a regular toothbrush. I would buy this again.
"
"
Was very disappointed not being able to find these locally, but Amazon came through yet again!  Very pleased with them and will definitely buy more!
"
"
I probably just have to get used to it but it makes my hand go numb.  We bought them for our upcoming trip so we don't have to bring our electric toothbrush with us
"
"
I am picky and charge my tooth brush monthly. These are nice and soft and do a great job with the vibration feature. Will buy again
"
"
Works well, for the price its a steal surprisingly came with Aaa energizer battery installed. Fantastic deal.
"

My son gags, and this is great for a quick Clean. Would buy again.

Seem good, but the brush only vibrates not spins❗️

This Colgate toothbrush was a pleasant surprise. I thought that at this price I'd be getting a piece of junk. Instead, I got a toothbrush that gives my $300 Sonicare a run for its money. This is because it does just about everything that the Sonicare does, except for having bells and whistles (e.g., phone app, fancy chargers) that are not relevant to having a clean mouth. For starters, this Colgate 360 is much more ergonomic than the Colgate 360 advanced optic. It is much thinner and lighter and therefore better to hold, store and pack away for travel. Secondly, this toothbrush leaves my mouth feeling just as clean as the $300 Sonicare.  This is likely due to the fact that they both share the sonic vibration technology, instead of brush rotation. Of course,  the Sonicare may pulse at a higher rate, but at the end of the day, my mouth feels just as clean with the Colgate as it does with the Sonicare. That's very impressive given that the Colgate costs $290 less.The only factors to get used to are the larger brush heads on the Colgate as well as the different bristle material. I quickly adjusted to the larger brush head. The bristle material feels a bit more synthetic and less luxurious than on the Sonicare, but honestly, it's nothing to gripe about given the huge price variance. What matters is that the bristles are still soft and gentle on your gums and they brush incredibly well. Overall, I'm very impressed with this Colgate brush. It is perfect for traveling or even for daily home use. Except for the bells and whistles on the Sonicare, it seems to perform just as well. Full marks from me!

This is no $400, more-tech-than-Silicon-Valley toothbrush. This is an affordable, self-contained ultrasonic toothbrush that does exactly what it needs to - clean your teeth - and nothing more. There'e no buggy phone app, no chargers, no extra anything. It's powered by a single AAA battery, easy and cheap to replace, which will last for weeks if not months.There are, however, a few things I'd like to point out:1. Like any sonic toothbrush, this vibrates like crazy. If you suffer from any type of headaches, this may not be for you.2. The 'off' part of the switch is both smaller and harder to press than the 'on' switch. This may be by design, but it gets to be annoying.3. Why isn't the brush head replaceable? It's not like this is expensive, but it's just one more thing that ends up in the garbage.
"

I absolutely love these Sonic Powered Toothbrushes!! I have a very expensive electric toothbrush but I can honestly say that these work just as well. They clean very throughly and the little floss tips get deeper and further into my teeth and it leaves my mouth feeling just as clean. The head is also much bigger so I can cover more surface area at one time, making my brushing time shorter. The replacement heads for my brush are really expensive and I would honestly rather get these instead! This way I can get a whole new brush every few months for much less than my replacement heads.They are supposed to be replaced every three months or so but I always change them out once I begin to notice signs of wear. The battery can be replaced if you happen to run out of juice before the bristles are done.The only slight issue I have with them is that they don’t fit in my toothbrush holder because the bottoms are so wide (to accommodate the battery).
"
"
A step up from manual brushes, the 360 Sonic Power brushes from Colgate vibrate the bristles that gave me a marginally better cleaning. I personally prefer either manual brushes or a full-out electric toothbrush with rapidly spinning bristles. The floss tips were what I liked the most because it does get into the gum line a bit more, although it certainly irritated my gums more than other soft brushes. It's a bit harsh in that regard but my teeth near my gum lines felt noticeably smoother than usual with a soft manual brush.
"
"
I normally use the Phillips Sonicare Diamond or Oral-B 7000 series toothbrushes so my review is a comparison to those.This Colgate battery operated toothbrush cleans quite well, but, is definitely not as good as a premium rechargeable toothbrush, I actually found myself moving my hand while using this toothbrush because it really does not provide as many strokes per minute as my premium rechargeable toothbrushes. In short, it is better than a manual brush, but, will not produce premium results.The bristles are quite long, and, if you spend enough time, they give a very good clean, however, the brush head is actually too big for me; I would prefer something smaller.After 1 week of use, the battery is still going strong, but, this can be changed when they do run out. At $12 for a pack of 2, that is $24 per year for a decent quality battery operated toothbrush, though, do note that the brush heads are not replaceable.I recommend these for travelling or as an affordable improvement over a manual toothbrush.
"
"
At this price, the clean performance of these toothbrushes is insane. Absolutely out of this world. You can feel the interdental floss brushing working because when you rinse with water, the water passes through your teeth with relative ease. That's a good sign, and not something you usually encounter with even the more expensive electric toothbrushes. The vibrations here are subtle yet felt, and never did I feel the toothbrush was too harsh or abrasive on my teeth.
"
"
We use smart toothbrushes from Oral B and Phillips at home... but when travelling, we've always found the travel cases to be bulky and a bit of a pain. These toothbrushes cost less than the cost of a head replacement and are actually quite excellent. They fit in my toiletry bag really easily and there's no need to pack a charger or bulky charging case with these since they're AA.One thing to note is that these brushes get kinda sad and ineffective with batteries that are dying. It's probably best to set a reminder to replace the batteries periodically so you don't just gradually get used to a weaker clean.I'd still stick with the smart ones for home for the feedback they offer but think these are fantastic for travel, young children or someone on a budget.
"
"
Quick Review:I really like these toothbrushes. Simply push a button to activate 20,000 sonic strokes per minute.Comfortable to hold...the bristles are quite soft which I really like as I have sensitive teeth.They feature 4 different bristles....a floss tip for interdental cleaning, oscillating bristles for polishing, regular bristles for flat surfaces, angled bristles for cleaning along the gum line, and also has a tongue & cheek cleaner.Requires a single AAA battery which are included.Overall a very simple straight forward toothbrush that gets the job done without the bells and whistles of some.Recomended for sure!
"
"
I was picking up new toothbrushes for my youngest two children to test and I picked up this two pack for me to test. Almost my whole life I have used hard tooth brushes, and lately my wife has been trying to convert me to medium. So, it was brand new for me to try a soft brush. I was very impressed I have used this several times now and feel it does a very decent job cleaning my teeth and gums. Very happy with my experience with this brush and would seriously consider switching to it as my default brush. Only feature I would like would be for it to have a timer function like so many other offerings on the market. But solid construction and excellent functionality.
"
"
If you’re using an expensive toothbrush with electric charger at home,  then I would say this Colgate floss tip toothbrush is an excellent tooth brush to take with you overnighting or going on a vacation.  It’s also great for younger children because it fits comfortably in the palm of their hands, it has the rubber grips at the on/off, so it wouldn’t slip out of their hands easily. I like the slimness of this electric toothbrush, it encourages kids to brush their teeth. The bristles are soft and does not bruise your gum. Overall a excellent toothbrush for any age.
"
"
I have a spin brush I use at home but I hate taking it with me on camping trips or vacations.  These Sonic Power toothbrushes have really impressed me.  They are gentle, yet powerful and seem to really get between my teeth where food and plaque could easily build up.  I really believe they do as good of a job as my expensive brush.The only thing to note is how both brushes look alike.  We put a black sharpie dot on one so we don't get them mixed up.
"
"
The toothbrush works surprisingly well at this price point. There are so many electric toothbrushes on the market currently. Some of them are very fancy - having a lot of functions, being connected to app via Bluetooth, and having a formidable price tag. This one is very basic and use replaceable batteries. However, the cleaning power is strong. The floss tip makes cleaning more effective. The brush is indeed very soft. I strongly recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
As far as electronic toothbrushes go, this one is kinda disappointing. It has a light vibration to the whole thing, but the heads and bristles don't actually move at all.Works as well as a regular toothbrush but with slight vibrationna we'll. So I'm sure it'll work at least as well and any standard brush for cleaning your teeth.Comes with 2 brushes. Disposable.
"
"
It’s hard to use a toothbrush of this quality when I’ve been using a Phillips Sonicare diamond collection for many years. This toothbrush is alright if you are not willing to spend loads of money on one. However, you get what you pay for and this toothbrush does not have quality. It’s a great investment for kids rather than adults.
"
"
The pack has two brushes. It’s battery powered that oscillates 20000 strokes per minute. I felt nice after using it. It’s not alternative of regular flossing however sometimes when I feel lazy doing flossing I use it. It has angled bristles to help in reaching hard to reach areas. Overall a good value for money brushes.
"
"
Colgate is known for toothpaste and toothbrushes. These are good brushes, although I primarily use a different type of toothbrush.Two come in the package and should last someone a fairly long time.  The price seems fair for the quality and the fact there is 2.These are also good for travelling.
"
"
This is a gimmick, pure and simple.  Has the same imbalanced motor you find in some razors and cell phones... the bristles don't move, but the whole thing buzzes.Between that and the waste involved (the whole thing is disposable), it's not worth considering.
"
"
Good sized brushing head, which is important if you hate having little brush heads likes I do. Thick handle for an easy grip bristles are nice and 2 for $11 is decent. I don't think the sonic power really does much but they are still just a decent toothbrush nonetheless.
"
"
I love this toothbrush for travelling! I normally use a Sonicare but I dont like to bring it when I travel and this one is an amazing alternative! It is baterry operated and batteries can be exchanged.
"
"
 It is technically an electric toothbrush, it does vibrate a bit. Doesn't feel like the vibration is doing anything though. It's not intense enough to remove anything more than a normal manual brushing would.
"
"
clean most of the areas, only thing which i didnt like is the battery power.Battery didnt last long, but with the price, its worth for the money
"
"
I love this toothbrush, it's great and disposable... Just what I was looking for! I love the thinner floss tips to get in between my teeth and leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean! 😁👌🏻
"
"
I am glad to have learned that tooth-brushing can be this simple and effective.But angry that I took so long!This brush cleans your teeth almost the same as a dental hygienist.In between the teeth feels smooth, and it is light and simple and unobtrusive and compact.Excellent value for money!
"
"
I have used this brand of toothbrush before and love it.  An electric toothbrush was just a bit too severe for my permanent bridges but the Sonic Power toothbrush does the job well.
"
"
Not a great brush. It just vibrates not a motorised one. Ocerall not bad experience.. But, it seems a rotating brush in picture
"
"
Great deal on this set. Will definitely purchase again.My teeth feel amazing and I don’t feel the need to put pressure on my brush when brushing now. It’s amazing.

Ca nettoie tres bien les dents. Mo  fils a tres bien aimé son experience dune brosse vibrante.

My favourite and newly chosen toothbrush!! I love with the power. Has lasted me a great amount... not so much my hard brusher boyfriend LOL

I am a little bit surprised that the inexpensive power feature seems to work.

Such an amazing price for a decent entry level motorized Toothbrush.  Really feels comfortable.  Good for a kids primary and traveling adults, (not adults primary).  Sleek design blends into existing decor.  Highly recommended and impressed with the value!

My regular brush is a sonic rechargeable one, with a small head and a powerful strength.My review is based on a comparison between the one I use and a product on the subject.Pros:- Great bristles, clean thoroughly and getting deep between the teeth.- The tang cleaner does the job.- 1 AAA battery is included.Cons:- Batteries powered - it requires 1 AAA battery. I prefer rechargeable versions.- The brush's body is short, and its surface is somewhat slippery when wet. I have rheumatoid arthritis, and using the brush caused me a pain in hand.- The head of the brush is longer and wider than my regular brush's head, and the size caused me several times a laryngospasm.Note:The manufacturer's description of the product on Amazon's page says:- The brush has a replaceable head - it is not replaceable- It requires 2 AAA batteries.But the model on the subject, Colgate 360 Sonic Power Toothbrush,  powered by 1 AAA battery.

===INTRODUCTION===I had the opportunity to review the 'Colgate Sonic Power Toothbrush w/Floss Tip' for 1 week.Included in my review is my experience with the product over the course of the above time line (3 brushes per day, x7 days).===PROS +===+Ergonomic Grip is Very Comfortable;+Well Designed Bristle (maximum coverage);+Rear Tongue Cleaner;+Battery Included'===CONS -===-Cleaning is Average vs. Higher End Battery/Electric Toothbrushes===CONCLUSION===You only have one set of teeth - once they fail due to poor maintenance, that's it - they never regrow! With that being said, you want to overly invest in dental hygiene to ensure that your teeth maintain excellent condition throughout your life.This particular Sonic Power toothbrush provides an average clean and is ideal for using on short trips. In order to save on battery costs, you can purchase rechargeable batteries from Amazon (AmazonBasics are the best value).Overall, if this is a toothbrush you will use on occasion, it's recommended; however, long-term, purchase a high end model to keep your teeth/gums in ideal health.

The floss tips were what I liked the most because it does get into the gum line a bit more, although it certainly irritated my gums more than other soft brushes. It's a bit harsh in that regard but my teeth near my gum lines felt noticeably smoother than usual with a soft manual brush.
"
"
I normally use the Phillips Sonicare Diamond or Oral-B 7000 series toothbrushes so my review is a comparison to those.This Colgate battery operated toothbrush cleans quite well, but, is definitely not as good as a premium rechargeable toothbrush, I actually found myself moving my hand while using this toothbrush because it really does not provide as many strokes per minute as my premium rechargeable toothbrushes. In short, it is better than a manual brush, but, will not produce premium results.The bristles are quite long, and, if you spend enough time, they give a very good clean, however, the brush head is actually too big for me; I would prefer something smaller.After 1 week of use, the battery is still going strong, but, this can be changed when they do run out. At $12 for a pack of 2, that is $24 per year for a decent quality battery operated toothbrush, though, do note that the brush heads are not replaceable.I recommend these for travelling or as an affordable improvement over a manual toothbrush.
"
"
At this price, the clean performance of these toothbrushes is insane. Absolutely out of this world. You can feel the interdental floss brushing working because when you rinse with water, the water passes through your teeth with relative ease. That's a good sign, and not something you usually encounter with even the more expensive electric toothbrushes. The vibrations here are subtle yet felt, and never did I feel the toothbrush was too harsh or abrasive on my teeth.

We use smart toothbrushes from Oral B and Phillips at home... but when travelling, we've always found the travel cases to be bulky and a bit of a pain. These toothbrushes cost less than the cost of a head replacement and are actually quite excellent. They fit in my toiletry bag really easily and there's no need to pack a charger or bulky charging case with these since they're AA.One thing to note is that these brushes get kinda sad and ineffective with batteries that are dying. It's probably best to set a reminder to replace the batteries periodically so you don't just gradually get used to a weaker clean.I'd still stick with the smart ones for home for the feedback they offer but think these are fantastic for travel, young children or someone on a budget.

Quick Review:I really like these toothbrushes. Simply push a button to activate 20,000 sonic strokes per minute.Comfortable to hold...the bristles are quite soft which I really like as I have sensitive teeth.They feature 4 different bristles....a floss tip for interdental cleaning, oscillating bristles for polishing, regular bristles for flat surfaces, angled bristles for cleaning along the gum line, and also has a tongue & cheek cleaner.Requires a single AAA battery which are included.Overall a very simple straight forward toothbrush that gets the job done without the bells and whistles of some.Recomended for sure!

I was picking up new toothbrushes for my youngest two children to test and I picked up this two pack for me to test. Almost my whole life I have used hard tooth brushes, and lately my wife has been trying to convert me to medium. So, it was brand new for me to try a soft brush. I was very impressed I have used this several times now and feel it does a very decent job cleaning my teeth and gums. Very happy with my experience with this brush and would seriously consider switching to it as my default brush. Only feature I would like would be for it to have a timer function like so many other offerings on the market. But solid construction and excellent functionality.
"

If you’re using an expensive toothbrush with electric charger at home,  then I would say this Colgate floss tip toothbrush is an excellent tooth brush to take with you overnighting or going on a vacation.  It’s also great for younger children because it fits comfortably in the palm of their hands, it has the rubber grips at the on/off, so it wouldn’t slip out of their hands easily. I like the slimness of this electric toothbrush, it encourages kids to brush their teeth. The bristles are soft and does not bruise your gum. Overall a excellent toothbrush for any age.
"
"
I have a spin brush I use at home but I hate taking it with me on camping trips or vacations.  These Sonic Power toothbrushes have really impressed me.  They are gentle, yet powerful and seem to really get between my teeth where food and plaque could easily build up.  I really believe they do as good of a job as my expensive brush.The only thing to note is how both brushes look alike.  We put a black sharpie dot on one so we don't get them mixed up.
"
"
The toothbrush works surprisingly well at this price point. There are so many electric toothbrushes on the market currently. Some of them are very fancy - having a lot of functions, being connected to app via Bluetooth, and having a formidable price tag. This one is very basic and use replaceable batteries. However, the cleaning power is strong. The floss tip makes cleaning more effective. The brush is indeed very soft. I strongly recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
As far as electronic toothbrushes go, this one is kinda disappointing. It has a light vibration to the whole thing, but the heads and bristles don't actually move at all.Works as well as a regular toothbrush but with slight vibrationna we'll. So I'm sure it'll work at least as well and any standard brush for cleaning your teeth.Comes with 2 brushes. Disposable.
"
"
It’s hard to use a toothbrush of this quality when I’ve been using a Phillips Sonicare diamond collection for many years. This toothbrush is alright if you are not willing to spend loads of money on one. However, you get what you pay for and this toothbrush does not have quality. It’s a great investment for kids rather than adults.
"
"
The pack has two brushes. It’s battery powered that oscillates 20000 strokes per minute. I felt nice after using it. It’s not alternative of regular flossing however sometimes when I feel lazy doing flossing I use it. It has angled bristles to help in reaching hard to reach areas. Overall a good value for money brushes.
"
"
Colgate is known for toothpaste and toothbrushes. These are good brushes, although I primarily use a different type of toothbrush.Two come in the package and should last someone a fairly long time.  The price seems fair for the quality and the fact there is 2.These are also good for travelling.
"
"
This is a gimmick, pure and simple.  Has the same imbalanced motor you find in some razors and cell phones... the bristles don't move, but the whole thing buzzes.Between that and the waste involved (the whole thing is disposable), it's not worth considering.
"
"
Good sized brushing head, which is important if you hate having little brush heads likes I do. Thick handle for an easy grip bristles are nice and 2 for $11 is decent. I don't think the sonic power really does much but they are still just a decent toothbrush nonetheless.
"
"
I love this toothbrush for travelling! I normally use a Sonicare but I dont like to bring it when I travel and this one is an amazing alternative! It is baterry operated and batteries can be exchanged.
"
"
I always use a soft toothbrush, otherwise, my teeth gums bleed. I bought this brush because it was labeled as a soft one, however, when I used this, it is super hard and causes pain to my gums. Had to throw it away after just one use. Giving one star due to the wrong label.
"
"
Purchased as an add-on item for $1. Ordered this because my order needed to be at least $35 to qualify for free shipping. Love Oral-B tooth brushes. This one seems very basic. Will probably get the job done :)
"
"
I bought 5 to keep in my unexpected guests box. I like to have a few sets of essential toiletries on hand in case someone stays over, and forgot theirs. My sister in law gave me the idea. Just a small box with a toothbrush, body wash, mini deodorant, mini comb, etc. Great product to add for $1 to meet the free shipping threshold and the brand is definitely one I trust. Happy with purchase and would purchase again 😊
"
"
It did not look like the picture. It's crap. The tooth brush was not the normal Oral B bristle design. I bought a Walmart brand tooth brush once that was better than this. It's not soft, it's a medium softness and I will be replacing it right away before it wrecks my gums.
"
"
This toothbrush is not soft.  I have used medium and hard toothbrushes before, and this one is worse than a hard one! I have scrapes on my gums from this brush!  Very upsetting! What if this was for one of my kids instead? Could have tore up their mouths worse then my own.  Highly disappointed.
"
"
These toothbrushes only last me about 2 weeks before the bristles flatten and I have to replace it. Normally I am pretty hard on my toothbrushes and replace them every month but these I find I have to replace even more frequently. The handle is pretty comfortable at least.
"
"
My gums are sensitive and I was having issues using Colgate & Crest tooth brush, so my buddy suggested using Oral B toothbrush as they are well known for their soft bristles. The toothbrush itself is not bad however not soft enough for my sensitive gums.
"
"
Not soft. There are very hard plastic bristles all around the ""soft"" bristles and they are awful. I cant use this toothbrush but it was cheap so maybe if I go OCD I'll have a toothbrush to clean the hard to get spots in my bathroom or car.
"
"
Cute and cheap toothbrush. I've been dying for a new one for forever so I'm very happy with this purchase. It is a stiff brushing at first but I don't brush so hard so it should get better. If you have very fragile and sensitive teeth, I do not recommend. Otherwise, the perfect teeth brushing!
"
"
Toothbrush may not be the colour shown in picture. I received a red; thought it would be blue. It's cool though, thanks!

It’s a good toothbrush but I wish the bristle part was wider. It’s smaller than I’ve ever seen actually. But good value considering the price I guess. But I would honestly recommend the dollar tree one over this one.
"
"
Umm idk if this is what I think it is but the first day I used the toothbrush I thought I was so lucky for buying this for a dollar but the day after in the morning I whent to get it and the side was like a greenish black color I think it’s mild and it was also on the side it’s good for the price but I mean I would like to not have payed for a oun time use toothbrush
"
"
Not kuch to say here; it's a toothbrush. Decently soft, and well priced. A great staple to keep in mind when I need to bump my order up a dollar for shipping purposes.
"
"
How do you review a toothbrush? :):) comfortable in the hand.... goes where many can’t??
"
"
I usually don't give negative review. Probably it's the first time over 2 years using Amazon. This toothbrush is way too hard. I bought two and I use them on my shoes now. It will damage your tooth, don't use it. lesson learnt.
"
"
Bristles are harsh on gums, mine started bleeding but I guess can’t complain much for the price paid. Still it’s oral B
"
"
The package says soft but it is actually hard. It is also larger than normal toothbrushes. I will buy soft from a different brand and use this one to scrub the toilet or something.
"
"
Good filler  to get free shipping
"
"
Photo is as is. You receive a tooth brush. Package was not damaged. Happy with my purchase thank you seller.
"
"
Excellent product from Oral-B. Meet the expectations. Gentle gum cleaning. Added it to cart as add-on item to meet requirements of free shipping.
"
"
Not the best of the best quality toothbrush but amazing value for the money, I stock them for my Airbnb.
"
"
Bought this as a cheap add on item to get my Free delivery and guess what this is now my go-to tooth brush, Great brush at just under $2!
"
"
This is a great little toothbrush. Nothing fancy but does what it needs to do and easy on the teeth. Will by again.
"
"
I just received the toothbrush just 5mins ago, it was fast delivery, fantastic price, I recommend it
"
"
The quality of this brush doesn’t look like original Oral-B from that which is available in Walmart..
"
"
Good quality for price. Usually a good add on item for me to qualify for free shipping.
"
"
The bristles is not soft at all, its actually pretty hard(similar to the brush that you use for cleaning). I prefer real soft bristles since hard bristles can damaged your tooth.
"
"
What did you expect? It's a toothbrush, and it's literally the price you can find in any local store...
"
"
Great price, way cheaper than in stores. Will buy them from amazon from now on
"
"
For a hella lazy human... great price and I didnt even have to leave my house haha
"
"
Ended up cleaning the toilet with it. And tried brushing my teeth too. Prior to the toilet cleaning of course. Both my pearly whites and the pearly white bowl are sparkling.
"
"
Works well. It is soft enough for my teeth. I would certainly recommend it.
"
"
Soft enough on my gums, still firm enough to do a thorough brush job.
"
"
I was looking for a gentle toothbrush and came across this one. After using it, I was really pleased because as well as being a soft and gentle toothbrush, it also reaches all of my teeth as it is very flexible. Would definitely recommend :)
"
"
good toothbrushes, and great price, soft and gentle on gums.
"
"
for the price it’s a good toothbrush. easy to replace (cost wise)
"
"
Cannot go wrong with this when it is an Add-on price :)
"
"
I got it when it’s on sale, one dollar each, I got four, really good
"
"
Very good quality tooth brushes at a remarkable price.

Good item. Delivered fast and I'm very happy with purchasing this item.
"
"
Great cheap tooth brush. I like keeping several on hand for unexpected visitors.
"
"
Good price for a decent toothbrush!
"

It is not that soft. If you really need soft don’t go for that one.
"
"
Perfect soft and does the job great price point good quality
"
"
Good price for adding to an order
"
"
Tel que la description, merci !
"

My old toothbrush was far too hard and was causing me some dental problems, so I switched to one of these and started being more gentle. End result is much less grief with my teeth.
"

Bought for Christmas Hampers

Are you really looking at a review for a toothbrush? It works. Add toothpaste and water. Brush for 2 minutes.
"

Good brushing.
"

works fine. bristles were still a little too hard even though i got the 'soft' kind
"
"
Awesome brush that cleans teeth thoroughly. Haven't noticed whitening but I really like the way it feels brushing.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush. It cleans very nicely and it is a good size. I'm going to buy another one.
"

I wasn't expecting much when I bought it, I just wanted free shipping on another product. The toothbrush turned out to be a lot better than me older one though!!

I bought a few of these initially earmarked for our guest bathroom and didn’t expect too much, but these are really good toothbrushes and an excellent value given the price point.I like the size of the toothbrush’s head (not too bulky, but good length for the bristled portion), slim grip handle,  bristles are clustered tightly and angled well at the tip to let you easily tackle difficult-to-reach spots at the back of your molars. For those so inclined there’s also a bit of a tongue cleaner on the backside too (if you can handle tongue-scrubbing without gagging – personally, I limit tongue scrubbing to dental visit days).I like the blue bristles that fade over time to indicate when you’re due for a new toothbrush too.  Overall, this toothbrush is as good as any that I’ve purchased in the drugstore for twice the price.  That said, I was expecting a soft brush and this feels more like a medium firmness to me.If you’ve read to the end of my toothbrush review, chances are you’ve already fallen down the rabbit hole of unconsciously reading dozens of reviews today, looking for a useful add-on item while you’re online shopping.  Trust me, you can’t go wrong just adding this toothbrush to your cart and moving on to more fascinating reviews… (if all else fails and the brush is firmer than you like, you’ve got yourself an inexpensive yet handy brush for cleaning your kitchen sink’s crannies, grout, or even jewelry).  There’s nothing more to see here.  Buy it.  Move on.  No regrets :)
"
"
My go to toothbrush. The bristles are the perfect stiffness for comfortable cleaning. The blue fades halfway out of the bristles so you know when it is time to change you’re toothbrush. Amazon also offers subscribe and save for this toothbrush so you always have a new brush when you need it!
"
"
I bought this specifically because I wanted to replace my hard bristled toothbrush with a soft one, so imagine my confusion when the bristles on this felt EXACTLY like my hard bristled brush. I'm still confused, unless they now make Extra Soft...there's nothing soft about this at all.
"
"
I love add on items, I purchase quite a bit off Amazon as my schedule is quite hectic.with add on items its like a little gift I get form amazon :)this is an awesome toothbrush
"
"
Would have liked to have been able to choose the color of my brush. Seeing as it is used every day, being able to have the color we want makes sense.Anyway, it's good quality and does the job.
"
"
This has become my favourite toothbrush.  It seems a little too soft at first, but after adjusting and fine-tuning the pressure, I am able to clean my teeth more completely than any other toothbrush.  If it came in a larger head, it would be the perfect toothbrush!
"
"
Ordered for stocking stuffers, was not disappointed. Ordered 4, got 3 assorted colors which made it easy to tell them apart. Glad they weren't all the same color
"
"
I was sent a different colour then the photo, which was disappointing as the whole reason I choose this one was because it was supposed to be pink. All in all, still a good toothbrush, and very soft, good for sensitive teeth.
"
"
Personally I find the bristles soft. I needed to change my other toothbrush soon and this one is perfect
"
"
Nice toothbrush, good value. I ordered 3 though and Amazon shipped all 3 the same colour. ☹️
"
"
Great as an emergency brush for company. I like the grip on these brushes and price is good.
"
"
The toothbrush is exactly what I hoped for: soft enough to be comfy but hard enough to clean, plus the size was fine even though it was a bit on the larger side.
"
"
Cheap price, but still does the job. The bristles are extremely hard though, so make sure your gums are solid and not sensible.
"
"
I like that the handle does not flex like some others. I use it to brush my teeth.
"
"
This “soft” brush is HARD.  I cannot recommend it.  Look for an alternative.
"
"
Cant complain.Cleans great! For $1 and name brand  you cant gi wrong.
"
"
Bought as an addon. It's a toothbrush like any you can buy at the store. Cleans your teeth like it says.

One of my favorite toothbrushes!
"
"
Great brush

Would be nice to have colour choice. If I bought this in a store, I would be able to choose from a selection of colours available on the shelf. Especially important in a household with multiple people. Need different colours to tell toothbrushes apart.
"
"
is ok
"
"
I mean, it's a toothbrush. I bought it for like, $1.50. I'm not even using it to brush my teeth, but to clean a humidifier. Works well enough.

You can buy other lines/brands of toothbrushes for half the price but I do like these 360's, they have way more bristles than the other lines. That said, because of all the bristles they are stiffer than others, so these ""medium"" stiffness 360's seem to me like hard equivalents of cheaper toothbrushes. Not a deal breaker, still loving these, but next order I think I'll go for the soft 360's.
"
"
I've been using this brand of toothbrush for a few years now and it's the only one that I like. I love that it has the tongue brush on the back as well as the plaque brushes in the bristles.  I have sensitive teeth and receding gum lines so I pair this toothbrush with the Colgate Sensitive toothpaste and I find that it works the best for me.
"
"
I dont have sensitive teeth or gums but these brushes are horrible. The rubber circles in the bristles feel and sound horrible when theyre scraping against your teeth. In general they feel horrible to use. I wont buy these again, I may use up the rest that are in the package for cleaning around the house haha
"
"
I have sensitive teeth and I agree with other reviews that there are definitely much softer brushes.  These will do but I will definitely go a different direction next time.  If you do not have sensitive teeth it is a very nice brush.
"
"
What I like most about this particular one is that it really does feel like a 360 clean, and the tongue cleaner is abrasive enough to clean yet still gentle.I recommend going for this one, it gives you that nice, deep clean that leaves you feeling super fresh.This toothbrush is definitely worth every star. Cheers, Colegate

I almost damaged my gums because of the medium-bristled brush advertised on this ad.I believe they should re-state their product with SUPER HARD BRISTLE instead so people would not get surprised when they brush their teeth with a medium bristled toothbrush!
"
"
Medium bristles, as advertised. Combination of open pattern plus different lengths of bristles works for me to get between teeth. New fangled, though. But what can you do? You can't do nothing! Just more and more of those new fangled things all the time.
"
"
Extremely hard, gum recession inducing bristles. Threw the whole pack out. Entire family complained about how painful these brushes are. Good for scrubbing toe nails only.
"
"
We are happy with these. We used to use oral b brand but they did not last at all. These are more durable and do a great job.
"
"
Cleans teeth great. Easy to hold and use. Different colours make it so everyone knows there tooth brush. Good value pack!

Works great to brush my teeth. This is a dumb review
"

I love the cheek scrubber on the backside. Never buying a different toothbrush again
"
"
Not a fan of the medium bristle but they do the job.
"
"
I have crowded teeth, but this toothbrush cleans very well! Its easy to get the hard to reach places.
"
"
Love these toothbrushes.  Good price, good quality.
"
"
Yup, the bristles are definitely still pretty hard even with the ""soft"" ones. It does look different from those ones that are in store.
"
"
Was able to get med hard to find last for a while
"
"
Is a good product but this is more a personal opinion: this brush is too hard for my taste. I had to stat brushing gently but almost every time I get my gums to bleed a bit.
"
"
The toothbrush is too hard and even on the first brush the bristles start to come off.I would never buy this again.I wish I could return it.
"
"
Good toothbrush but could be softer
"
"
Very good price for great toothbrushes
"
"
Great value pack, work great.

Ces brosses à dents sont très désagréables à utiliser:  poils trop rigides, s'insèrent mal entre les dents, trop massive inutilement. MAUVAIS ACHAT
"

These are my favorite toothbrushes. Would be better if you could pick your colors though.
"
"
Brushes my teeth pretty well!
"

Very impressed by the difference we noticed brushing our teeth with this toothbrush compared to other (cheaper looking and pricewise) ones. Worth every penny.

Very good happy and the  price  awesome

Good sized toothbrush.

Bristles are unusually stiff for a soft toothbrush (more like a medium - I had to double check the package since this is the stiffest 'soft' toothbrush I've ever encountered.My teeth still feel fuzzy after brushing, which I don't like.I like the silicone rings, but the bristles are just too hard.I know there is one version of the Colgate brush that is VERY similar in appearance to this, with 3 silicone rings that is much softer - I actually have an old one - but it looks like Colgate no longer makes it. I even emailed the company, but they told me to go to the store and see whats available (no attempt to help whatsoever).
"
"
The size of the brush is better than expected, will buy again.
"
"
No regrets these are like CAD $15 in Walmart the cheapest got these for like $6
"
"
good one
"
"
As expected
"

I only use Colgate toothbrushes and I enjoy trying the different varieties. When these arrived I didn't think I would be able to get to the back of my mouth because of the large round brush. I normally use a narrow toothbrush vs a round toothbrush however these did the job. There’s something about this brush that I really like, it’s comfortable just feels right. Thanks Colgate :)
"
"
This is a toothbrush with a larger head than your 'regular' toothbrushes. I would recommend it for adults with bigger mouths. It says it is soft bristled but to be perfectly honest I would not classify it as such.I bought this as I usually use an electric toothbrush and like to have a manual one to 'mix things up'. I used to like this brand and style but it seems like it has been modified or else I have become an old curmudgeon who has nothing better to do than complain about toothbrushes. I am hoping that it is the toothbrush.
"
"
The brush itself is pretty nice, I don't have much to say about it. I hate the handle though. There's something about the curve that makes my hand slip too far near the end of it. I don't feel comfortable with it at all.
"
"
Definately an upgrade from 2 dollar brushes I bought at a local grocery stores.Update: lasts about a week longer than the brand's cheaper line up as well.
"
"
Colgate 360 Toothbrush, Soft.  Very efficient design.  I actually got a compliment from my dentist as to how well brushed my teeth are.  The 360 Toothbrush reaches into the little crevices where the gum has separated from the molars.  Excellent product.
"
"
Great brush, fun to use, rubberized grips so you can really aggressively hammer the brush into those hard to reach areas of your throat.
"
"
I brush my teeth with mine. What do you do with yours?
"
"
I love the little rubber ring in the middle of these... makes your teeth feel like they've just been to the dentist for a cleaning!
"
"
Best bang for buck! These really get in there
"
"
The little silicon things make my teeth shiney white. Love this!

Does exactly what you need it to do. Not too hard, not too soft.

"

Well made product,works great,very impressed with the quality of this. I was very impressed with how clean my teeth felt even after the first use. It is so soft and flexible and so easy to reach every corner of my mouth. Nice design and battery life is amazing. Smart timer is great. I like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area. So far, it's working great for my sensitive teeth. If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get. Recommend!
"
"
You can tell from the look and feel of this toothbrush that it really is a quality made product. It looks great in black with nice blue neon LEDs. Good for travelers and going away for two reasons. First, if you charge it before you went away it would last for 30 days which is longer than most people's holidays. Secondly, it has a custom power lead with a USB end so you could use a PC or phone charger to charge the battery.The cleaning performance is excellent. Your teeth feel super clean and smooth after the first brush. It has five different modes for those so it has one for everyone. When first using the brush it tickles your nose and caused me to itch quite badly but this went away after a couple of days. Two spare heads and a smaller cleaning head for getting right between your teeth.My last brush was an Oral B that used to take 24 hours to charge and barely lasted 6 days from new. It really is no comparison this is 10 times better in every department. And questions or problems are dealt with so fast it's unreal. You would be lucky to hear from the likes of Oral B or Colgate inside two weeks if at all.This brush has a really comfortable, robust and quality feel to it. It outperforms major brands easily whilst undercutting them on price. It's a great brush.
"
"
I wasn't expecting any good performance to be honest. But it's much more exceed my expectations, really liked it, using for over a week , battery remains good for twice for a day. Has different options for your teeth, plus I really liked it's 30 sec signals so you can arrange equal amount of time for all teeth. Really appreciated .
"
"
 Wow... i liked this toothbrush. It comes with 3 external brushes. So 3 person can use it thats the good point.Having 4 function with diffraction vibrations. Battery life is also amazing as I am using it from last 6-7 days and I didn’t charge the single time.I will recommend this..
"
"
 One of the best toothbrushes I’ve had! It’s a lot less clunky than other electric toothbrushes but it still has great battery life. I haven’t had to charge it since I first got it. I really appreciate the different modes, which allow me to you less power on parts of my mouth that are more sensitive. Definitely a great buy for the price.
"
"
Amazing electric toothbrushWorks amazingYou can choose different types of modeHave extra 2 brushs for futureGreat valueGreat functionalityGreat qualitySo light!!!!Recommend people!!
"
"
This item arrived very quickly, so I was very pleased right off the bat. Comes in a nice packaging, with the USB charger, the toothbrush, heads, and a plastic cover for the head. The plastic cover is a great add-on for traveling (but I use it in my bathroom too, it's just cleaner). I was looking at a number of electric toothbrushes, but for the price of this one compared to others, it's a great buy and I would highly recommend it.I've had this product for a little over two weeks now, and I brush several times a day for 4 minutes at a time. I have some mild OCD, and while my teeth come out relatively clean at the 2 minute mark (with sensodyne) I prefer a four minute brushing to really get ALL the plaque. If I use arm and hammer toothpaste, the 2 minute timer works great. The nice thing about the timer is the 30-second increment feature. So far I havent had to charge the toothbrush yet brushing for 8 minutes a day (about 16 days of battery use so far).So far I've used this toothbrush on the White and Clean modes. I'm sure all the modes work for their intended purpose, but I find the clean mode the best.

I really like this toothbrush. I will say that it doesn't clean quite as well as brushes with dual heads, though it is longer lasting than others I've tried in the past. It does clean well, and I love the grip of the pretty pink material it is made of - it feels like a soft rubber or silicone. It has multiple settings and I like all of them. It arrived charged, and I haven't had to recharge it yet, and I've been using it twice a day for over a week now. I would definitely recommend for a good value option.

Well made product,works great,very impressed with the quality of this. I was very impressed with how clean my teeth felt even after the first use. It is so soft and flexible and so easy to reach every corner of my mouth. Nice design and battery life is amazing. Smart timer is great. I like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area. So far, it's working great for my sensitive teeth. If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get. Recommend!

You can tell from the look and feel of this toothbrush that it really is a quality made product. It looks great in black with nice blue neon LEDs. Good for travelers and going away for two reasons. First, if you charge it before you went away it would last for 30 days which is longer than most people's holidays. Secondly, it has a custom power lead with a USB end so you could use a PC or phone charger to charge the battery.The cleaning performance is excellent. Your teeth feel super clean and smooth after the first brush. It has five different modes for those so it has one for everyone. When first using the brush it tickles your nose and caused me to itch quite badly but this went away after a couple of days. Two spare heads and a smaller cleaning head for getting right between your teeth.My last brush was an Oral B that used to take 24 hours to charge and barely lasted 6 days from new. It really is no comparison this is 10 times better in every department. And questions or problems are dealt with so fast it's unreal. You would be lucky to hear from the likes of Oral B or Colgate inside two weeks if at all.This brush has a really comfortable, robust and quality feel to it. It outperforms major brands easily whilst undercutting them on price. It's a great brush.

I wasn't expecting any good performance to be honest. But it's much more exceed my expectations, really liked it, using for over a week , battery remains good for twice for a day. Has different options for your teeth, plus I really liked it's 30 sec signals so you can arrange equal amount of time for all teeth. Really appreciated .

 Wow... i liked this toothbrush. It comes with 3 external brushes. So 3 person can use it thats the good point.Having 4 function with diffraction vibrations. Battery life is also amazing as I am using it from last 6-7 days and I didn’t charge the single time.I will recommend this..
"

 One of the best toothbrushes I’ve had! It’s a lot less clunky than other electric toothbrushes but it still has great battery life. I haven’t had to charge it since I first got it. I really appreciate the different modes, which allow me to you less power on parts of my mouth that are more sensitive. Definitely a great buy for the price.

Amazing electric toothbrushWorks amazingYou can choose different types of modeHave extra 2 brushs for futureGreat valueGreat functionalityGreat qualitySo light!!!!Recommend people!!

This item arrived very quickly, so I was very pleased right off the bat. Comes in a nice packaging, with the USB charger, the toothbrush, heads, and a plastic cover for the head. The plastic cover is a great add-on for traveling (but I use it in my bathroom too, it's just cleaner). I was looking at a number of electric toothbrushes, but for the price of this one compared to others, it's a great buy and I would highly recommend it.I've had this product for a little over two weeks now, and I brush several times a day for 4 minutes at a time. I have some mild OCD, and while my teeth come out relatively clean at the 2 minute mark (with sensodyne) I prefer a four minute brushing to really get ALL the plaque. If I use arm and hammer toothpaste, the 2 minute timer works great. The nice thing about the timer is the 30-second increment feature. So far I havent had to charge the toothbrush yet brushing for 8 minutes a day (about 16 days of battery use so far).So far I've used this toothbrush on the White and Clean modes. I'm sure all the modes work for their intended purpose, but I find the clean mode the best.

This is a great tool when paired with flossing and mouthwash. It really does a deep cleaning of my teeth. There are a bunch of different modes to use, and I use most of them to ensure I get a good cleaning. They include 3 different brush heads for soft, medium, and hard brush users. I personally use medium, and it works great. I like that it comes with a cover to protect any germs from getting to it. Very light weight, easy to use, and not to mention its INEXPENSIVE compared to the $200 dollars ones I have seen. I recommend this!
"

I was seriously considering spending a new hundred dollars on a tooth brush but figured I'd try this one first. for $30 I think it's a steal. My teeth feel extremely clean after using it for a few days. Comes with 2 extra brush heads and one accessory to clean between teeth. I am curious to see how it will hold up in the next few months but other reviews seem very positive
"

 Pink!!! LOVE THE COLOR. so as my daughter. She said it's not boring anymore to brush because it's her favorite color. It's a win win situation in our house. And bes part it has a sensitive mode for my 7 year old to use which makes it a great toothbrush. I just hope motor will last long. And now searching for replacement tooth brush heads. Love products like this. Makes parents issue easier.

Purchased this toothbrush as a treat for myself after Christmas, bought a second one for my son, and will purchase another for my husband (who is now electric toothbrush curious) within the month (why not earlier? because he doubted my claims.) I previously had a Philips sonicare toothbrush and that electric toothbrush is from the dark ages compared to Fairywill.Pros to this toothbrush:1. The charge lasts forever. A couple of hours plugged into the USB and the charge lasted longer than a month with multiple uses each day.2. There's no charging base, so you're not getting gunk settling on it and you're not killing the battery inside by having it charge 99% of the time, and it isn't taking up space on your sink, no precarious cord using precious outlet space.3. It's lighter than your average electric toothbrush, it's thinner, and it's smaller, so it's easier to use and pack for travel. It feels less like a clunky appliance you're putting in your mouth, but a sophisticated tool.4. Strength is just right. It gets the job done and you get that clean post-dentist feel you don't get from manual toothbrushes. The multiple settings are fantastic (the polish one really kicks things up a notch.) Also it has an automatic timer, which guides you to brush your teeth for the right amount of time.5. Price. A steal, frankly, considering how much my previous electric toothbrush cost as well as the brush heads. You don't realize how much of a premium you're paying for a brand name until you stumble across something like this, the value is fantastic.If you've never tried an electric toothbrush before, I would suggest this one. The cost, quality, and form are all excellent, even if the brand is unfamiliar. I've been using it for six weeks and there is a definite improvement over my previous electric toothbrush. It makes toothbrushing less a chore and more a self-care hygiene ritual. You look forward to it!

I have always wanted an electric toothbrush but all the good ones are too expensive. I once bought one a long time ago and it only lasted 3 weeks. I bought this one without too high expectations but it totally blew me away. The brush feels very premium and I love using it. Brushing my teeth is no more a chore, it is something I look forward to!

After my $300 Philips sonicare diamondclean died suddenly I decided to purchase a more affordable electric toothbrush. I ended up buying Fairywill electric toothbrush and so far I’m quite satisfied with this purchase. It is good looking and lightweight. It does a similar job (if it’s not the same) with my old super expensive toothbrush. The best thing is the battery life which is 8-10X longer than Philips. Overall I’m pretty happy with this product and I purchased another one (punk colour) for my wife. It is highly recommended, great product at a fraction of the price of my old toothbrush.
"
"
I used to have $200 which sadly died after a decent time of heavy usage. I liked it but spending $200 on a toothbrush seemed a bit extravagant. Bought this one instead. It's noticably weaker than phillips (less moves per minute) but it's a good thing, because both me and my wife complained about Phillips being too hard on the gums. I feel no difference in cleanliness after use and its milder on my gums. Will see how it holds up with the time (I've had Phillips for almost 4 yrs, that's very good), hopefully this one is durable too.

I have used a battery operated Colgate tooth brush for a few years and have looked off and on for a better quality tooth brush during that same time.  I finally purchased this toothbrush based on customer feed back.  I had intended to buy a Oral B or the like but settled on this one.  I received the toothbrush quite quickly.  It was packaged nicely.  I charged it right away and used it the first night.  I found that it is quite a noisy toothbrush.  You won't hear anything else around you when your brushing.  I also found that the brush head is quite small and I  would have preferred it to be bigger.  I am hoping my gums will get used to the vigorous brushing.  My teeth do feel cleaner.  Not sure of the battery life since I have only used it a few days.
"

I was sceptical about this toothbrush at first, I had never heard of the company before and so I had to ponder for a while, and weight my options until I took the decision to go with it. If you're looking for a rotary electric toothbrush, this isn't it. Let's be clean that it is a sonic toothbrush.Is the toothbrush good? Yes, I will as far as to say that I haven't had a great clean that leaves me refreshed in ages.The toothbrush itself is the same size as a brand name electric toothbrush, but the charging cable is much simpler, you just plug it into the base of it and then use the same usb block you use for your phone. Which in turn makes it easier for travel purposes (as you don't have to pack up the base that the brand name toothbrush suits on). The matte black finish with golden inlays make it stylish. It has 5 modes to it but I cannot review all of them as I have only used the ""clean"" mode. The integral timer let's you know exactly when to change spot (2 minutes with a small pause every 30 seconds).Was it worth it? Definitely, I would recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants a sonic toothbrush that's affordable.
"
"
This was my first foray into electric toothbrushes and I have to say I’m really pleased. I have extremely sensitive teeth, and I’ve always had pain and discomfort while brushing with a manual toothbrush, no matter how soft the bristles are. With this, there was no pain. My teeth came out smooth and perfect. Almost I would say nicer than they ever came out with a manual toothbrush because I wasn’t having to skip a certain teeth because of the pain. compared to other more well-known name brands, I would say that this is just as good if not better, and for a much more reasonable priced. I am going to buy one for my significant other, because it is not only affordable, but it is well-made and works great as well. I also love the small miniature toothbrush head that is used to get between teeth and into smaller crevices. No other toothbrush that I have seen comes with one like this. Also, the fact that it comes with extra toothbrush heads means that you don’t have to reach out to the manufacturer for quite some time as you are set up for roughly a year of healthy brushing with your first package.
"
"
Can’t say enough nice things about this toothbrush. It looks cool, has a narrow enough head to get into the hard-to-reach places, and is powerful enough to clean well. I’ve used a couple of electric toothbrushes in the past and felt like there was nothing special about them. This one makes me feel like I’ve coming straight from a cleaning at the dentist and has managed to remove the tea/coffee stains that I sometimes get behind two of my bottom teeth.I bought one for my daughter soon after buying this one!

This is a 3 month review of this toothbrush . I bought two of these . One for me and one for my wife . For the first month I was so impressed of the battery life . I didn’t charge if for over 30 days . Same as my wife’s . Upon my first charge , it only lasted about 6 days . When my wife had no problem lasting over 30 days . Now it lasts about 7 days on average for charge . Not sure if I have a defective one or not . My wife has no problems with hers and is still doing well . Also a pain that it won’t work plugged in . So I’m constantly charging it . Not a bad product . Just wish my battery was the same as my wife’s.Update ###Battery is completely dead . Charge last one day then have to charge again the next.
"

I've had this toothbrush for over a month now and I can confidently say it is the best toothbrush I've ever bought. I initially bought it as a replacement for my expensive toothbrush that broke, as I wasn't willing to spend another $200+ on a toothbrush, and this seemed like a cheaper alternative. This toothbrush is even better than my original. It has multiple settings based on the brush you want, like sensitive or whitening, and lasts over 30 days on just one charge. Theres no bulky charging stand to kill the battery and get dirty, just a USB cord you can use to charge. When I took it out of the box, I did not charge it before I started using it, and it lasted the full 30+ days. I have only had to charge it the one time. The toothbrush itself is sleek and I love the design. The kit comes with multiple heads to get you started, and you can buy replacement heads as well. Overall, I cannot recommend this toothbrush enough, especially if you aren't ready to spend absurd amounts of money.

I recently bought a Fairywill P11 toothbrush (which is perfect!) and I decided to buy one of these for my wife so that she will know how good this brand is. The P11 is still superior to this one, which makes total sense because that one is more premium and more expensive. But the performance of this toothbrush at this price point is definitely a win!Forget Sonicare and Oral B, Fairywill is taking over the electric toothbrush market!THE GOOD/GREAT:- The 5 brush modes are actually functional. The first 3 are the vibration strengths and the next 2 have different vibration patterns. This means you have plenty enough options that suits your brushing habbit.- This one is smaller than the P11 - almost the same size as my old Oral B Vitality but the handle is slimmer which makes it more comfortable to hold while brushing. The sleek design also makes it perfect for travelling and with a 30-day battery life, it is longer than any vacation I would go to.- The package contains 1 main brush, 2 brush heads, and 1 mini head (for people with braces or maybe use it as a pick). Now I have a total of 3 brush heads that I can use for what, 9 months right? I'd say it is just a really great investment especially when we talk about dental health.- Value for money. What else can I say, I wouldn't leave a review if I am not equally impressed and satisfied with the products I purchased. At this price point, pretty soon I'll buy more for my kids and possibly give it as a gift. This is way more practical than giving someone something they will just put in a drawer.- Overall quality - this competes with mainstream brands pushing $100~ price range. The base models of those toothbrushes doesn't come even close to the amount of features (and price) this one offers. Even the packaging is way better than the other ones which is why this is also perfect as a gift.THE OKAY (because there's really nothing bad with this toothbrush):- Bristle quality is just normal. The P11 has a really premium brush head - but like I said, it is way more expensive than this 407 model. By no means this is bad. This is just as par as the regular ones you see on store shelves.- I wished there is a travel case that came with this. This is fine not having one because all other toothbrushes at this price range doesn't have one as well. It is more of a bonus having one though.All in all, this is a well built electric toothbrush. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I hope the other people sees it that way as well. If you are upgrading from a manual toothbrush, this one will definitely give you that ""dental cleaning"" feel after your first brush. Nuff said, Fairywill knocked it out of the park!

I have been using the phil sonic for years, and it's giving out. So decided to give this toothbrush a try. It is great! huge bang for your buck, works super efficiently. Has way more options than my old toothbrush. You can do whitening and even gum massages and it works well. MOST amazing aspect is the battery life. I don't even need a charger for a month it lasts such a long time. The look of the toothbrush is also great, it feel sleek and high quality. Overall i def recommend these you should give them a try!
"
"
I am used to an electric toothbrush, so I was not expecting a huge improvement. I did want to get away from replacing my battery every few weeks. I have only used this toothbrush for a week but I am amazed at how much cleaner my teeth feel. The whitening mode is very fast, so hard to get used to but so far, I love this product. I can't rate the battery life, as I have not used it long enough. For travelling, it comes with a little cup that goes over the bristles but it would be great to have the one with a travel bag.
"
"
 This toothbrush was a great surprise. My usual brushing routine before was using traditional brush, mouth wash then dental floss and I thought may mouth was already in touch cleanliness, but Nope! my dentist recommend me to use electric toothbrush, so I've decided to have one and  I got this! after days of using it my teeth are so incredibly smooth. It cleans so well and adjust its vibration according on what you need. It's as if I just left the dentist after a good polishing.  Highly recommended!
"
"
I have tried a few brands of electric toothbrushes, and Fairywill is by far the best. My mouth is as clean as if I just visited the dentist -This model is the perfect blend of cost/features. Interval pausing every 30 seconds is the coolest feature, actually the right way and time to clean your teeth. It gives you thorough cleaning for teeth and gums with absolutely no noise. its very light weight and will highly recommend buying this product. Also bristle quality is very good and very gentle on teeth. It's all the toothbrush you could need. I've had friends with the higher versions , but even they are using this toothbrush now are very satisfied.This toothbrush is excellent and you'll be happy you got it.

Ça fait presque deux mois que j’uttilise maintenant la brosse a dent. Je ne l’ai charger qu’une seul fois et elle brosse encore très bien, avec vigueur.Ça ma pris quelques semaine pour m’habituer aux vibrations, puisque c’étais ma première brosse a dent électrique, mais une fois habituer, on voit que la brosse est efficace.La brosse vien avec son chargeur et une tête de remplacement, ce qui évite de racheter d’autre pièce dans l’immédiat.Seul petite chose qui me décoit, c’est que lors de la charge, il n’y a pas d’indication lorsque la batterie est charger completement, le chargeur continuerais a l’infinie. Donc on ne sais jamais si la brosse est totalement charger.Très bon produit en général, à très bon prix.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush! I’ve been meaning to get an electric toothbrush for a while and decided to order this one because it had such good reviews. I love it! Made my teeth feel so clean after the first time using! Definitely great results for the price! Ive ordered a second one for my husband since he decided, after hearing me saying how much I liked it, that he wanted one too. The timer is a nice touch and good for children and adults alike to brush their teeth for the right amount of time. Very happy 👍🏼
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price. It has many different modes. The tip cover is a nice little add on that you usually don’t get with electric toothbrush brushes. It comes with a few extra heads which is also nice. The heads are different than other electric tooth brushes which makes it harder to find but for the price it is a great option. The battery life is also great. It holds charge for a long time!
"
"
I have used many types of toothbrushes but thus one is amazing. My teeth after using this one has never felt cleaner and I even ordered extra brushes as this one is my favourite and want to have it around for awhile. I love that it has the different modes and timer on it that keeps me on track to brush longer than I did before with other toothbrushes.  Anyone who buys this one will be more than satisfied using it and I recommend it 100%.
"
"
I have taken a real liking to this Sonic tooth brush. The brush vibrates super fast and as you move it around your mouth it leaves your teeth feeling very clean. The battery life on the brush is very good as well and after repeated use for over 2 weeks I have yet to charge it up. The brush feels great in your hands, not too big or too small. Overall I really like it.
"
"
It is a great brush for the price. Pink being the women’s favourite is what I chose to. The colour Is great and I like the design too. The bristles are not too hard neither too soft which makes it perfect.The 5 different modes help me decide and choose the stimulation I want and the 30 second stop is useful to remind me to switch between cleaning. The only thing is the noise of vibration but this is my first time using an electric brush so I guess i would be used to it. Overall just love the style, design and packaging
"
"
When I first got this, the vibration and sound drove me around the bend. People said to give it a chance so I did! Well, I am glad I did as I started using it approximately 6 weeks before my annual check up and cleaning at the Dental Office. The hygienist asked what I was doing different as she only had a couple of very tight spots to descale. My teeth had never been so clean. I told her about the Ferrywill electric toothbrush. She and my dentist  were really impressed. Now I am excited to see how next year’s checkup turns out!

I was looking for best budget electronic brush as I never try any electronic one before and this one I found good one out of top 10 user review on google so thought to give it try.  I surprise after few days of usage of fairywill - 507, it's just amazing.I love different mode and it's look. Good thing is I can easily keep it into my tooth cleaning kit and do no not need to carry charging adapter all the time. I am going to buy for my parents and brother as well. Thank you Fairywill ! :)
"
"
This toothbrush is perfect if you're looking for an electric toothbrush that isn't too complicated.It has 5 different settings and a timer option. I ordered the black and gold model and I have to say I love the design! It's very modern, has a good weight and doesn't feel cheap at all.It is also very easy to purchase replacement heads on Amazon as well which is a huge bonus! I still haven't had to charge it since I bought it- battery life is long lasting!
"
"
My main concerns for electric toothbrushes is intensity, because I've used toothbrushes before that were just TOO MUCH and it hurt to use them (felt like my brain was vibrating), so I was hesitant to go with a new brand. Luckily, this is a great product and I'm very satisfied with my purchase!I agree with all of the other reviews and this is absolutely a product that I'd recommend to others. I'm also thinking about buying it again as a gift for others, because it's fantastic. It's easy to use, easy to measure the length of time that I'm brushing, the battery life is insane, and I love that it came with so many different heads. And really, you can't beat that price.Highly recommend.
"
"
I won't repeat what everyone has written.I will say that I realized once I began using it, that I prefer tooth brushes with LARGE heads/lots of bristles. The brush is so small that I feel like I'm brushing my teeth with a child's tooth brush. Also, when it comes to electric tooth brushes, I also realized that I prefer round brushes.
"
"
I always wanted to use an electric toothbrush. Then I found this one. This toothbrush is handy and neat. It perfectly fit to your hand. It has 5 modes which you can change with your necessity. And it is easy to use. You don't need to worry about brushing teeach now. It has 4 heads and I think it will be enough fir several months. Overall its a good tooth brush for the money
"
"
One of the best electric toothbrush I have used so far, it has many features like massage, cleaning, polishing and a feature for sensitive teeth. The toothbrush charges pretty fast and you can connect it to any USB output, that's pretty amazing. This toothbrush has a smooth mate finish and it also has good grip which is really good. The best part is that it also comes with a mystery surprise gift which obliviously I won't say what it is but its really cool.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush set-- polishes to a satisfying degree without gag-worthy skull rattling vibrations. Multiple cleaning heads, the tapered one is a beautiful little gem for getting in around the gum line. Times out beautifully, easy to switch between modes, surprisingly quiet and that battery lasts a very long time between charges.
"
"
This toothbrush is a must have I bought it over a week ago and I can tell you this toothbrush wont let you down (so much better then a regular toothbrush) . For the price it's perfect usually one of these toothbrushes would rack you $60 to $100 but for this one it's a fraction of that. The toothbrush works by a vibrating action and comes with 3 heads and one for flossing. If you are wondering oh my teeth are real sensitive it has a setting for that , this toothbrush actually has 5 settings (white,clean,sensitive,polish, and massage) the settings are really straight forward I like that it's also easy to use . Press the power button once turns the toothbrush on and then if you continue pressing the power button it will keep lighting up for which setting you desire. The battery lasts a long time I don't know what they used but been using the toothbrush for a week now and have not had to charge it once what so ever. Last but not least the toothbrush works really amazing and my teeth been getting whiter by the day . If you want an affordable electric toothbrush that has everything checked off then this toothbrush is the toothbrush for you :)
"
"
I got one each for me and my 2 kids.I love it.Initially it took about 10 mins of using the toothbrush to get rid of stains from smoking and tea drinking but now, using the toothbrush daily for 2 mins, 2 times a day, I don't have issues with stained teeth. (Stains weren't too crazy but still visible)Now with Covid-19, I can't see my dentist so really loving this toothbrush.I like that the toothbrush pauses every 30 seconds. It helps make a routine with bushing my teeth. (30 secs outside, 30 secs inside etc.)My son doesn't like how much it vibrates his teeth but he'll adjust.
"
"
If you've looked into other electric toothbrushes - namely the sonicare or oral b ones - you'll notice one thing: the price. Typically those range anywhere from $80 to $250+ for a decent toothbrush, and sometimes they only come with 1 toothbrush head.  This product is really good value as it gives you 3 heads in total (lasting for 9+ months), 5 different cleaning modes (though I only really used the 'clean' mode), a quad pacer (timer for brushing your teeth), and a long battery life (and I mean LONG). Only downsides are there's no pressure sensor, the bristles won't have wear indicator, and the toothbrush charges via a cable (not a base). However, these downsides are minor, especially for the price (pressure = you get used to it, bristles = just change it when it wears down, cable = you only need to charge it 1 once every month to two months anyways). Overall this brush worked as expected for me! Oh you also can't forget how the replacement heads are A LOT cheaper than the oral B or sonicare ones!
"
"
Honestly my teeth are so happy now I don't have my teeth don't take no More. I have very sensitive teeth I hate brushing my teeth I don't do a good job but with this I can't mess up. plus they gave me the thing that you put on to floss your teeth with and I'm telling you that works beautiful. my teeth feel so clean even if I only do it once a day my teeth stay feeling very clean all day long. If you hate brushing your teeth I suggest getting this electric toothbrush it's awesome.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush for myself. It has soft bristles so it doesn’t hurt your gums. It has 5 modes like cleaning,masssage etc. I really love the massage mode post brushing. I feel the difference in my teeth in just couple of days. It’s way better than manual toothbrushes where you use a lot of pressure and can cause gum recession or gum bleeds. It’s a very economical rechargeable toothbrush and is way better that expensive brands out in the market. Just buy it and see the difference yourself. I really love it.
"
"
Where do I even begin? This thing brushes like a mad men, makes my brushing such a breeze and more efficient. Easy to charge and once fully charged, it'll last for a good amount of time. This is an amazing value for your money and it brushes just as well as those $100+ electric brushes. Aside from this godlike brush, but the after support has made my experience even better (shoutout to Holly for the assistance and fixing my problem). Thank the heavens I encountered this brush.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush. Initially, it was the sleek design that appealed to me, then I rationalized the purchase as improving my tooth health. It looks good, feels good in the hand, is very quiet, perfect to take on holidays too as the battery will hold a charge for weeks. It requires the tiniest dab of toothpaste. I am delighted.
"
"
I got this for Christmas but decided to try it out for a month or two before reviewing it. I have been using it since the end of December and still have not recharged it. That is using it faithfully twice a day!I'm soooo impressed with this brush. Definitely recommending it to everyone :)*EDIT*the charge light just went on - March 17th and I've had this since Christmas. I use it at least twice a day!! Battery is FANTASTIC!
"
"
It’s my first real electric toothbrush (I was waiting for a rechargeable that didn’t need a base) and I love it.I started on the sensitive setting to get used to the vibrations and my sensitive teeth look and feel great. Much less lazy to brush now! The black color makes a nice gift
"
"
As many reviews have stated it does take a little bit to get over the tickling sensation but other than that this is great toothbrush. I wanted to try an electric toothbrush at this price point before I spent a lot more on one of the major brands. I’m loving this one and still using the original charge from manufacturer weeks after it arrived. Incredible value for money. Pull the trigger in this one.
"
"
I had originally written a different review but because of the great customer service I received I decided to fix it.Although the tooth brush wasn't what I expected it can still be good for other customers just not for me.

I have been using this for a week and I can say that this is different than anything I have used before for my dental health.  The ""white"" mode is definitely showing results and the ""massage"" mode is quite relaxing for the gums. These are the only 2 modes I have used. It takes time getting used to. My suggestion would be to use this sparingly for the first week. Although it has a ""sensitive"" option, I would suggest to consult your doctor before using this if you have gum problems.

This is my very fist electric toothbrush. I have braces on and normal brushing sometimes still leaves food stuck. And I can't time it right, especially if I'm in a hurry, I'll brush ""quickly"" and go. With this, since there's a 2min timer, I can estimate for how long I should brush certain areas. At first, the vibration bugged me a little but if you set your mode to sensitive you'll get use to it eventually. I'm still in that mode for a few weeks now since I have a sensitive teeth, but you can change it eventually once you get comfortable. Also, out of the best sellers in amazon, this one I think is the most affordable and effective product since I've only charged it once so far and I bought it like a month ago.

I have never used an electric brush before.  This toothbrush was very easy to use and was slender for my small hands.  I have used it for several days and haven't had the need to recharge it yet.  I like that I have a deeper reach with this toothbrush and my teeth feels very clean after each brush.The toothbrush comes with a 2 minute limit for each session.  I feel this is more time than needed and I generally finish brushing before the 2 minutes.This is a great buy and value!
"
"
Great electric toothbrush with replacement heads for soft, med and hard preferences.  Easy to charge with USB and holds charge well.  Toothbrush comes with multi functions for cleaning, whitening, polishing etc.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush to up my oral-hygiene game and I am not disappointed. It is much taller than a regular toothbrush but is still very comfortable to brush with. The head comes with multiple brush heads (ex. soft, firm bristles and a cone shaped one). It was vibrate for 30-sec intervals and is very obvious when you need to switch quadrants. I now brush my teeth for the length of time your supposed to

I went to the dentist recently and there were a few concerns with my teeth. Ive always had good pearl white teeth so i was a little shocked. She told me to buy an electric toothbrush and that should help my situation so i came home and bought this one.So far so good, it works great! Makes my teeth feel super clean and is gentle on my gums (which is one of the reasons i had to buy it) it says once charged it last 30 days, so far shes going stong. It says it flashes to let you know when it running low on battery (havent gotten that far yet).All and all its a great toothbrush and a great price! Would totally recommend 10/10
"
"
This an excellent brush, I have used electric toothbrush before but this one is next level,works great and after brushing I feel like coming back from professional dental cleaning, I charged it to full the day it arrived and I am on my 8th day and have  not charged again... cant get better for this price or even more.
"
"
Powerful toothbrush that leaves your teeth super smooth! I like the different modes and a full charge can last well over a month. Replacement heads are not expensive and the device itself is nice and light. If you're looking for a sonic toothbrush you can't go wrong with this one!
"
"
Purchased this brush after my 10 yr old Braun died and I'm very pleased with this toothbrush. I'm really picky about which dental products I use and this one has kept me happy. The battery lasts long, the sound is a minimal buzz, teeth feel very clean after use. My only criticism is for the placement of the buttons, it can be easy to hit another setting while brushing. I'd definitely purchase again.
"
"
So far I am happy with my toothbrush. I do however have very sensitive teeth and even on the sensitive mode I find I can only use this brush a few times a week and my regular brush the rest of the week. My teeth feel very clean after using it but I notice how cold water is right away and I have a few weak spots on my teeth that feel it during the actual brushing. I do not press down when brushing just lightly brush.
"
"
A quiet electric toothbrush. A lot lighter and less noisy than other electric toothbrush that I have used. Soft bristle. Cleans quite well - first day my gum did bleed a bit but it was because it got rid of the plaque build up that my manual toothbrush couldn't reach. After the first day no more bleeding. Regarding the whitening effect, I'm still testing it out. In terms of the battery life, I have had the toothbrush for about 10 days now, and the battery is still going great. I like the fact that it comes with two addition bristles, and that it offers different mode. Overall very satisfied.
"
"
I have been using the brush for over a week now and i am very satisfied. it is a lot easier than normal brush, I don't have to charge it for several days and it doesn't take much place in the bathroom.  I found it confortable in the hand so I can do my 3 minutes brushing withour getting tired, and it doesn't hurt my sensitive teeth and skin. I am happy with my purchase and I am willing to use it for long time
"
"
This toothbrush is better than any of the ones I’ve bought in the store. It leaves my entire mouth feeling thoroughly cleaned after brushing and I appreciate the 20sec reminder to change spots. I haven’t had to charge it yet so it battery life does last. I like the black design and the other options from cleaning to whitening and massage. You will not be disappointed.
"
"
This is my first ever electric toothbrush and 5th times using it before this review. It feels weird in the beginning but after few minutes of use i got used to it and had fun doing it. It also feels like it cleans my tooth far better than the conventional toothbrush.
"
"
I bought it 9 months ago, and got a 2nd one recently for my spouse. I thought the head is a bit too small at first, but it turned out that smaller heads are actually better for cleaning every corner. This toothbrush is just easy to use and reliable. No need to mention the price is very affordable, but I should note that their service mind is amazing. Very caring and attentive to the voice of customers. I wish Fairywill would prosper for a long time, so I could get the replacement heads easily.
"
"
I really like this e toothbrush. It comes with 2 additional heads and the head caps. Battery last good after each recharge, I haven’t yet recharge after my first one. It come with five different mode to choose from based on the need of your teeth’s. My personal favourite is Cleaning. It’s good product in this price.
"
"
Bought this for a month-long trip because my electric toothbrush is a little bulky (as is the charger). This toothbrush performs at least as good as my old one that costed 4 or 5 x the price. The battery is amazing, I didn't bring the charger with me for a month and it lasted.
"
"
I had lots of electric tooth brushes. This is the only one that has removed my yellow stains. I'm a smoker and a coffee drinker so I had yellow surface stains. Before, I had to send about $60 on whitening strips a month but this tooth brush is doing the trick and I no longer need any other products. It also removes plaque, previously I had to use a metal plaque remover thingy. It also cut my flossing time in half because the brush bristles gets most of the particles stuck between the teeth.
"
"
 Been looking for an inexpensive electronic toothbrush for a long time and this is so light! The overall black is really nice too. Very smooth. Will see how the functions go for the next month :)
"
"
Je mets 5 étoiles pour le fournisseur ! Service a la clientèle vraiment bon , j’ai acheter cette brosse en pensant que ca serais ce que je cherchais , mais je me suis trompé , le service a la clientèles es toute intervenue , sen rien demander et ces assurer que tout sois parfais pour les deux parties ... alors je leve mon chapeau ! Bon produit ! Juste pas fais pour moi !
"
"
a black brush certainly looks nice there :) I like the speed but gentleness on my teeth so it feels clean but not hurting my gum. the package has spare brush for later use which is a bonus. USB charging does help in my case as I have a bunch of empty charger hanging around.
"
"
Solid addition and low-cost replacement to my Philips Sonicaire that just stopped charging/working. It has all of the options that my previous toothbrush has and works just fine. No issues at the moment as it is still an improvement to my non-electric brushes.
"
"
If you're looking for a toothbrush look no further, this one is the one to get. After using it for a week, I already noticed the difference in how clean my teeth are. The automatic timer comes in handy, and the different modes lets me take care of my teeth in ways I couldn't before. Also, the battery life is amazing and the bristles are really well made, it even comes with free replacement heads.But what was even better than the toothbrush was their customer service. I had a problem with my order and they got back to me instantly and professionally. Thanks again PRO care!
"
"
I'm pretty sure I bought this toothbrush over 5 months ago and I haven't charged it once.  Honestly, I am one of those weird people that loves going to the dentist and hygienist to get my teeth cleaned so you might imagine how particular I am about a toothbrush - this one 100% totally worth the price.
"
"
Gives me a just-came-from-the-dentist feeling, all the different settings are awesome. This is my first electric toothbrush so I don’t have anything to compare it to other then manual, but it’s like 10X better then that and it looks sleek and high tech, price wasn’t that bad.
"
"
I have been using this for over a month now. Bartlett life is really good (I used it for two weeks without charging it) and it cleans well. I brush my teeth like a Neanderthal, so this might help my gums out a bit.
"
"
There are many products that I buy on Amazon and I'm not paid for any of them. I never asked for a discount or any incentive because I don't want to be biased when I review.One of my top five purchases on Amazon
"
"
I haven't used very many toothbrushes but this one feels good I guess...? I have no complaints about it and I plan to keep buying new brushes for this toothbrush hopefully for a long time.
"
"
This toothbrush rocks! It's got a beautiful design, great size and several different settings. It comes with extra brushes and the battery lasts a long time. The only thing that I can suggest is selling it with a travel case, rather than just the box.Love it! 😘
"
"
I’ve been using it for a few days, definitely has some power and seems to work well. For this price you really can’t go wrong. Some people are sizing this up against higher end competitors - you really can’t do that. This is an overachieving, lower end product that drives great value at the price point. If it lasts a year it’s worth every penny.
"
"
Based on the price, it’s not bad. To me it feels cheap. When I turned it on the vibration is a lot and it has a very high pitched sound that I do not like. I have used other electric toothbrushes and it is not as loud as this one.
"
"
If I paid $80-100 for this toothbrush, it still would have been worth it. The battery life is insanely long (I got mine in Feb 2020 and didn't have to charge it until May 2020 with daily use).
"
"
I am very happy with this electric toothbrush and wish i bought one a long time ago. It just cleans my teeth better than any other toothbrush i hs before plus it has options for you to also whiten, massage, polish and for sensitive teeth. This is a really good toothbrush.
"
"
Didn't want to pay for high-end brands for my first electric toothbrush. After buying this one, I don't know why anyone would need to.Me and my wife are using it and the battery last for over a month.The multiple bushing modes are really useful.
"
"
EDIT: amazing customer service. Offered to fully refund me and send me a new toothbrush. Love this toothbrush so I’m very happy!I really like this toothbrush, but the only reason I am giving it 2 stars is because it constantly switches modes as I’m using it. I’m not sure if it’s supposed to do this or not but I find it a bit annoying. Other than that, I like the design and everything else about it.
"
"
new purchase not sure about the battery life, but compare the price with other brands this is a great value. Easy to use, the product looks nice and it is strong enough to clean my teeth, will plan to buy a pink one for my wife.
"
"
I've never really had an electric toothbrush before, but this one was the perfect price range for me. The options you get to choose is great and the battery life is amazing. I like that it has a timer turning itself off for a second to let you know when to move to the next section of your mouth. It's super easy to use.
"
"
Replacement for my oral-b toothbrush. It is different as in this vibrates vertically rather than circularly unlike my oral-b, but works just as well. At the price of one-fifth of what my original costed, this is a pretty god buy.
"
"
Higher quality with less money. Very happy with purchase. Comes with different tips but I only using one. I like massage function.Highly recommended soon going to buy another one.
"
"
Such a good price and the battery lasts FOREVER. my only complaint is that the actual brush size is small and a little too soft, but this device definitely makes up for it in price, battery, looks and variety of settings. I ordered 2 - one to keep at my boyfriends because I can’t go back to a regular toothbrush after using this!
"
"
The toothbrush is made of very good quality, very light, and very comfortable. every functions are working well. Easy to carry while travelling and can charge with your phone charger. It comes with extra brush which was not expected. Battery life is great. Results are very impressive. Worth buying it.
"
"
This is genuinely one of the best tooth brushes I've ever used.I wasn't expecting much for the price range, but it absolutely beats brushes I've spent $100+ on in the past.Its comfortable to hold and use. I've yet to have it roll or cut my gums. Super easy to understand the settings on the brush and how to access them.It also came in really cute packaging.Will be repurchasing.
"
"
I like the countdown to how many minuets I've been brushing. Then it shuts off when done. I find I'm brushing longer than what I was before. Teeth seem cleaner but only been using this unit for a couple of weeks. The vibration was a shock the first day but after that it's been great. So far battery seems great. I have no issues at all with this unit.
"
"
For the price, I didn't expect much. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package. It comes in a nice box and everything is sealed. It came with a few extra brush heads as well as one pointed brush. The settings are great and it stops briefly every 30 seconds to remind you to switch sides. After using it my teeth felt like I had just came from the dentist. I highly recommend this product!
"
"
An electric tooth bush makes all the difference in dental care! I recommend anyone who’s manually brushing their teeth to switch over to an electric on! They are able to reach the areas that manual brushing would not be able to reach! Also I have to charge it maybe once or twice a month. Couldn’t be happier.
"
"
bought 5 of these for myself, hubby and 3 boys. I love the 30 sec x4 feature on it. really makes my boys brush their teeth for longer then they were! I havnt charged it yet... its been 3 weeks of use. love them
"
"
This is the first time i am using electronic toothbrush and after using it i thought its worth it. You can not find better quality at this price. And the good thing is it come with 2 heads, soft and hard. Other brand will charge you for that.
"
"
There is stricly no comparaison between this tool and my former 15$ walmart toothbrush, a world of difference. The charge is provide by a special usb cable, a plus for traveller. A premium tool for health care.
"
"
first time i'm using an  electric toothbrush and  up until now i have no complaints. really like it
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I was skeptical as the head is rather small but after using it I realized it was great for getting into small spaces. One charge lasted me almost 2 months.
"
"
Great electric tooth brush for the price ! Charges fast and battery last long, and really like the extra cleaning brush heads included cause I use more of a hard bristle
"
"
The fairywill electric toothbrush is amazing! I cannot believe how well this toothbrush works, it gives a very good feel to my teeth after brushing them. I love the fact that it has five different modes which allow me to assist my needs more specifically.  Also, love the sleek vibe the colour and size of the toothbrush give! Truly was one of the best purchases I've made this year!
"
"
It's my first time using electric toothbrush and I was skeptical about how it will clean my teeth well but this has proven my doubts wrong. It makes brushing so convenient and easy to use. Also has a great battery life. Really loving it
"
"
Wow, this is an excellent product.  I cannot see it staying at this price for long.Quick buy one before the whole world finds out.This is an excellent sonic tooth brush.  GO FOR IT!
"
"
It’s amazing for the price I paid. It has white clean sensitive polish and massage options. There is 2 more extra brush heads and a cleaning head in the box. I’m glad I purchased it.
"
"
I love this electric tooth brush! For the money you can't go wrong! It works just like the expensive ones. Our older ones stopped working and they were a more expensive brand so I was so happy that this one works just as well! The charge also lasts so long which is another plus!
"
"
I am impressed with it. Wish I bought one sooner. Love the one extra head to get in and around gums. Teeth feel amazing.  Will have to get more once my little ones are ready for an adult brush.
"
"
Nice toothbrush, fast delivery.It came charged up and holds the charge for a long time. Light, easy to use. Like the multifunctional options, also.However, I find the brush head a bit too soft , it’s almost like the design is for children.I’m also wondering how or where to get replacement heads.Overall I recommend it.
"
"
Bought this for my wife, very satisfied with it, nice and lightweight easy to pack, lasts forever .. she is very happy, just need one for myself now!
"
"
Just bought two of these toothbrushes and replacement heads for my boyfriend and I. Received them on Friday and I couldn’t be happier with the quality, looks and works as advertised!Have only been using for 3 days so I can’t comment on the battery life yet but so far so good!
"
"
This is the first time I bought an electric toothbrush, and I am impressed with the quality. Its got different modes to have the teeth cleaned. Plus total 3 brush heads and a interdental brush. Its a complete package. The motor is powerful for a superb cleaning. Thumbs up to the product. Really liked it.
"
"
Very pleased. Great value. Battery life is long. Automatically shuts off after 2min of brushing. Different modes of brushing. Would recommend
"
"
I really like the way it takes a break after 30 second because thats what my dentist recomends 30 seconds every section and 2 min total. Also Comes with 4 different heads.
"
"
This product has been working flawlessly for months now. Impressive battery life! Replacement brushes reasonably priced, unlike the name brands here. Would strongly recommend.
"
"
This is my first electronic toothbrush since I was a kid but I really like it! The price is good and i like that it has different options for different needs. It also comes with a bunch of different brush heads that you can change it to. I've had mine for just a little over a month and it's been working great, haven't had to charge it yet.
"
"
I was a bit skeptical before ordering this due to a much lower price compared to other major brands but when I read the reviews and tried it myself I was not disappointed.
"
"
Just got this toothbrush a few days ago, but after the first try and I could tell the difference! Wow! My teeth felt squeaky clean!I have used a regular toothbrush most of the time but I am so happy that I switched to this electric one. It is definitely worth buying.
"
"
Pros: High capacity battery, USB slot charging,  fast motors, comfortable vibration,  good reach till backside, spare heads includedCons: No travel box included
"
"
Best toothbrush I’ve ever tried, works awesome and in only a few days my teeth are noticeably whiter. The timer and 30 second notices makes 2 minutes fly by. Does tickle bad at first but you get used to it quickly
"
"
I like that there is a timer and it pauses to tell you to switch spots of brushing so you get a full good brushing experience! Also, that there is other options other then just a button to turn it on.I really do feel that my teeth are cleaned properly every brush and I’m so satisfied about it
"
"
Great toothbrush! I have a $150 toothbrush and this $30 was for travel, but it works as well or better. My teeth are clean and white!!!!
"
"
Wow very great quality toothbrush for the price. It has many settings and it is very strong. Love it. I just wish I could get the pink one.
"
"
J'ai adoré ma brossé a dents, j'en ai même acheté une pour ma femme.  J'ai branché il y a déjà 9 jours et meme pas recharger encore. Plusieurs mode de brossage.
"
"
Works very well. Have only had it for a few weeks so can’t comment on battery life or use for traveling, but it cleans nicely and is very easy to use. I like the different settings to choose from.
"
"
This is an amazing toothbrush. This is the first time that I buy an electronic toothbrush and I’m sure it’s the last time. I really recommend this one guys. Battery life is amazing, it’s very portable and astethicly pleasing .
"
"
J’aime beaucoup sont poids, la brosse à dent est très légère comparativement aux autres brosses à dent électrique. Le seul problème, c’est qu’elle fait beaucoup de bruit.Sinon excellent rapport qualité/prix.
"
"
I was worried about using electric tooth brush. But trust it is working very well. I am using it since 4 days. Battery life is really good. Toothbrush charges really very quick which is the best part of this toothbrush. Highly satisfied.
"
"
Bought this for my six year old for Christmas, and she loves it. She actually asks to brush her teeth more often and loves the timer on it.
"
"
Good product, this toothbrush has a nice design! You can choose different modes: clean, massage, white... each mode has a different intensity and movement! Recommend!!!
"
"
Great battery but overall performance is very lacking... i have always used a oral b product and the cleaning ability on this unit compared to the oral b is not the same... feels like a mild vibration and not an actual cleaning
"
"
Great quality sonic toothbrush with multiple cleaning modes ! I used to own a Phillips brush that retailed for well over 100 dollars and this one is comparable . So far I would recommend anyone to buy this brush ! Customer service is also top notch . After purchasing , they reached out to me just to check in . Overall completely satisfied
"
"
Bought this for my daughter and she Loves it. She feels it does a very good job cleaning her teeth. Battery lasts a long time and it's great for travelling. Excellent  value for money.
"
"
This is my first electronic toothbrush and I'm pretty pleased - especially for the price. My only complaint is that I don't find the vibrating very effective. You still have to brush like you would using a standard toothbrush - the bristols don't actually move or clean on their own.
"
"
I am amazed that this electric tooth brush performs as well as any branded product. Used to hve a Philips until the battery died. This tooth brush has more features than the Philips one and so far it's great. Glad I bought it.
"
"
Bought for my daughter for Christmas and she says she loves it!  Says it makes her teeth whiter too. Going to purchase more for the rest of us
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. After one use I could immediately tell the difference in how clean my teeth were. The USB charging is a neat idea instead of a charging stand that gets dirty. Incredible value for what product you get.
"
"
This power tooth brush is truely wonderful.First try today and absoutley my teeth feel so smooth clean.Totally worth the money.Fast service delivery.
"
"
Charge lasts a long time. Lightweight, and USB charge makes it easy for travelling (esp where there are different voltages). I think I still prefer brushes with a circular head for my teeth, but that's a personal preference.
"
"
I'm disappointed in the battery life because it has to be charged so often but Fairywell has good customer service and reached out to me to try to make it right so I have changed my original review to reflect their efforts
"
"
Great working tooth rush with great value! Comes fully charged, with great intensity on each mode. Already seeing a difference with my teeth! Got 1 for my boyfriend for traveling as well.Pro tip, tooth brush comes with a charging wire but not a cube!
"
"
This toothbrush is amazing! I am obsessed it with it! And I love the clean sleek black look. My teeth feel sooo clean! Thank you!
"
"
I use my brush twice a day (2 minute each session) and the charge last for at least 3 months.  After recharging, good for another 3 months.  The various programs are nice to have and the overall strength of the brushing is great.A really buy at a very reasonable price.
"
"
Worth the price. Battery has lasted a month so far ! Had an oral B and this is much better. Love the look and settings. Brush head a little small but you get used to it !
"
"
Has various modes that clean teeth well and its convenient to hold and use daily. Recharges quickly and has a good motor
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush. I havent used the pick yet, but i notice less plaque in the harder to brush areas. Good product for the price!
"
"
Love love love this tooth brush. I previously had the oral b and hated it so much. Saw the amazing reviews on this one and had to try it out! And I’m so glad I did. Going on a month and it’s still holding the original charge! I bragged about it so much at work and 5 people ended up ordering the same one.
"
"
I love it !! Its really inexpensive for what it does, my teeth feels clean like it was cleaned by the dentist. It makes brushing your teeth fun, because usually I hate it. They also give you an interdental brush, wich is a really great tool for a clean finish. I absolutely recommend it.
"
"
I was hesitant to buy this product, now I am really happy I did.. I researched electric toothbrushes for about a month and I took a chance with this product and I am very pleased that I did.
"
"
I have used many other electric toothbrushes and this Fairywill brush is superior. The Price is less than half of some of the ""Brand name"" toothbrushes and yet outperforms them. The extra toothbrushes is such an added bonus as is the nifty travelling case.
"
"
Ergonomic in hand and the micro Sonic pulses clean my teeth better than my Philips Sonic brush. Great product at great value. So good I bought 3 more for my family members.
"
"
Différent mode selon vos besoins. Aucune douleur aux dents après utilisation. Doux quand même comme brossage.
"
"
The first time I used it made my mouth feel clean! Better than I expected from it. I will get more for my husband and kids.
"
"
It has different modes of cleaning and does the job PERFECT. it also has timer which gives you an idea of how much cleaning needs to be done on each side.Very happy I bought this product.
"
"
Love love love this brush. Bought one for every member of my family.I have receding gums and this is a great brush. So gentle!
"
"
I have had this toothbrush for 2 weeks now and used it 2 times every day and the battery is still not showing signs of slowing down. It's multiple speeds and pulses help get used to the rather odd sensation of the vibration in your head. Great buy and value!
"
"
~Affordable~Instant Results~Long Battery charge (haven't charge in a week)~More thorough brushing with 30 sec timerBeyond happy with this purchase.
"
"
First of all look premium great build quality and heavy duty I purchase this for the gift and she like it
"
"
Je l'adore ! Enfin une brosse à dent qui nettoie en douceur, mais très efficace. Je ne suis vraiment pas déçue de mon achat! Ça vaut la peine de l'essayer au lieu d'en acheter une plus dispendieuse.. elle fait extrêmement bien le travail pour le prix.
"
"
I like how powerful it is, long batter life, great design. However , I'm concerned on how to get the extra brush heads...the reviews seem poor, but we'll find out. Also...I wish you can order the sleek travel case on its own, hope this possible in the near future.
"
"
love this toothbrush, recommended by my dentist! Cleans, massages gums and whitens teeth!
"
"
Very nice electric toothbrush, not too pricey and you don’t need to charge it often!
"
"
Love this product! I’ve been using for almost two weeks, great battery life and different brushing heads. Love the colours too. Will continue using for sure!
"
"
I’m so happy with this purchase! I truly do feel like my teeth are clean after I use this. I love the different cleaning options too. The battery charge last for a long time as well. I also really like how it has a timer, you low you are getting a through clean!
"
"
After carefully considering many toothbrushes, I finally decided to get this one and I must say that I am pleased with my selection. This toothbrush does the job it was designed for. You can;t go wrong with this one.
"
"
Battery life is amazing! Works just as well as toothbrushes triple in price and it’s super cute!
"
"
I've had sensitive teeth and with this toothbrush it has really help improve my teeth.
"
"
Different settings are great. Light weight and hold a charge well. No cumbersome charging base
"
"
Le maniement de l'appareil et son fonctionnement est très utilie et facile.
"
"
Cleans my teeth well gets the hard-to-reach places. Easy to use. It lasts long on a one charge.
"
"
Very happy with this purchase. Toothbrush is of great quality and have had no issues as of yet. Highly reccomended.
"
"
Belle brosse comme sur la photo .ça super bien .la batterie dure très longtemps .
"
"
I've had it for a couple of weeks now and it works great. Comparable to expensive brands.We're three to use it 2x per day and haven't had to recharge it yet.Definitely recommend.
"
"
Jai acheté cette brosse en remplacement d'un ancien modèle. Wow! grosse différence d'efficacité et de durée de la pile. Aucune déception avec ce produit et jen ai acheté une deuxième pour mon ado.
"
"
My teeth feel much cleaner when I use this compare to a regular toothbrush, no tooth plaque, and feel very fresh after. Recommend to use it in sensitive mode if you first use it.
"
"
didnt want to buy a really expensive one so i went for this one . works wonderfully! i would definitely say my teeth feel clean for longer compared to standard brushing .
"
"
I was surprised by the quality of the product and the value for my dollar.Excellent buy. My wife loves her.
"
"
Loved this product but it stopped working after 4 months of use. It just didn't charge so I basically had to use it like a manual toothbrush.The company got in touch with me and I was offered a new brush as a replacement!Would buy again.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and I’ve been impressed every time I use it. It’s powerful, cleans well, is super light and has an amazing battery life. I’d recommend this to anyone looking to buy! It’s worth every penny.
"
"
Great toothbrush! I love that there was choices for different heads. I only had to charge once since December and it is almost the end of March. Very impressed. The price was perfect too.

Légère, efficace. Bon rapport qualité-prix, grosse différence sur la dentition après seulement 2brossages!  Je recommande fortement.
"
"
Works well, my teeth feel clean after use. It comes with extra brush heads which is great. It also comes with an inter-dental cleaner.. Overall great product, would recommend.
"
"
Well worth the money! the toothbrush is sleek and good quality, the battery lasts a long time (can go more than a week without a charge). The price is very fair for all the heads that it comes with along with the different settings. Love this!
"
"
Elle à plusieurs fonction : blanchiment, massage, nettoyage .....
"
"
Love this toothbrush! Amazing cleaning for my teeth, lightweight, and looks nice. Highly recommend this toothbrush!
"
"
Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, very sleek look. He loves it and it came with three replacement heads. perfect gift!
"
"
Works great, teeth and gums feel fantastic, only issue is I ordered 2 black and 1 pink colored, and received 3 black...otherwise will recommend to all my friends. Thanks Fairywill!
"
"
Thank you guys for the good quality product. We are enjoying the deep clean. Recomanded 100%
"
"
For it's price, it is by far one of the best electric brushes I have used. Recommend 100%
"
"
This is the product what I was looking for a long time, the brissels are soft and are comfortable and it also has different modes plus it also have a mode for sensitive teeth like me so all in all it is a great product that I would recommend.
"
"
Just got this unit and it looks pretty well made. Used it once and boy, my teeth were squeaky clean. Time will tell about durability , but so-far, looks like a keeper.
"
"
This is just great. My mom is a dental hygienist and she is impressed with the clean and polish I get. Highly recommend. My boyfriend can't believe he paid 350$ for his and mine is pretty much the same.
"
"
This is excellent. I’m obsessed with my teeth and I love it. The battery life is impressive. I haven’t charged it once since I got it two weeks ago and the sound of the toothbrush isn’t annoying or too loud. Just amazing.
"
"
You get want you pay for. Don't expect the performance to be at par with the very well popular and established brands.
"
"
Excellent, it really helps keep my teeth white and clean!
"
"
I used to buy Sonic brand but this one is less expensive and lasts and lasts. Very good product! I love the whitening option.  It work well.
"
"
The product works well. I like the long battery life when it is charged.  I would recommend this product.
"
"
The toothbrush works really well, super easy to use and cleans deep! One small consideration would be using a normal usb plug for the device this way If I lose the one that comes with pack I can use any other usb charger cable.
"
"
Does the job like you expect it to. Compact and powerful. Only charged once since I bought it and it's still working with good battery life. Not a bad buy for this price point.
"
"
Since I've gotten this about a month ago, I've only charged it once and it's still going strong. Seller contacted me to ensure everything was ok which made me happy! 10/10, thank you!
"
"
i love how this toothbrush works and the different seetings
"
"
La différence entre une brosse sonique et une brosse à dents électrique est tout à fait perceptible. De plus, elle est rechargeable, ce qui évite les frais ponctuels pour les piles. Un excellent choix!
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush! I continue to be thoroughly impressed with power and battery life. I have an after dentist clean feeling after every use. This product is a great price for its ability and power. Highly recommend!
"
"
For the price it is good value. Use it for travelling so is easy to pack. Head is a bit small for me but that may just be my preference.
"
"
What I can say is really good product. After using it. I feel my teeth fresh and clean. Great product.
"
"
GREAT ITEM! VERY HAPPY WITH PURCHASE! THANK YOU! A++++
"
"
so good, glad i didn't buy the expensive one. this one is awesome, battery last for wks.
"
"
We got this for our 11 year old son.  He really likes it especially the fact that the toothbrush counts to two minutes with  30 second intervals.
"
"
Got them for our kids and they love them. These sonic toothbrushes are gentle on the kids teeth and clean way better then regular tooth brushes.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I must say it’s fab! Loving it so far, no complaints.
"
"
Very nice kit for a lot less. Love the timed feature.
"
"
Overall a great toothbrush. My only issue with it is the vibration. I have very sensitive teeth, so the vibrating is magnified for me. It will take some getting used too. Other than that I love it!
"
"
Love the toothbrush - no problem plugging it into computer to charge.  Teeth feel incredibly clean - have a hard time seeing the settings but you can switch and tell the difference in very short order.  Love it
"
"
Very stylish ! My daughter loves hers!
"
"
My daughter loves this and now wants to buy one for everyone for Christmas!
"
"
J aime beaucoup mon achat étai rapide y bon qualité je suis très contente
"
"
Good looking and long lasting battery,Soft brush, easy to change and clean.We can give gift to someone, its a amazing product.
"
"
Great value for your cash. It stays charged for a long time too so ypucan easily travel with it without recharging.
"
"
Great product,  highly recommended
"
"
This was a gift for a friend, she loves it.
"
"
Long battery life. Looks nice. Stays clean. For the price, can't go wrong.
"
"
I love this tooth brush, my teeth not only look 100% better but my gums do as well. This is by far the best tooth brush I have owned and used in all my 46 years. Thank you so much
"
"
I was browsing for sonic toothbrush, but didn't want to pay 200 on them. so I found Fairywill, they are amaizing, battery lasts forever, and I really notice some amazing changes.
"
"
This is the second unit I have bought!  Very good purchase for a quality product!
"
"
mon épouse est tres satisfaite
"
"
great tooth brsuh system but found the head a bit small
"
"
Very good quality for the price! Multiple settings and comes with attachments. Battery life is great, if had it for 6 months now and only charged it 3 times
"
"
Really cleans teeth well! gets in the small areas, and has lots of power! Really happy with the purchase:)
"
"
I just switched to electronic toothbrushes, must say that this product was quite the thing I was looking for. Good value of money and easy to use.
"
"
Best investment I ever made. My teeth and gums feel amazing. No manual toothbrush or spin brush can come close. All plaque is removed. Love the timer, the extra  heads and different pulsing options.
"
"
Perfect toothbrush for the price.  Was comparable to more expensive toothbrushes I've owned in the past. Gf loved hers too so definitely would recommend.  Win win
"
"
Really great toothbrush. I was thinking of buying an expensive one but this one really does the job. Great buy and so inexpensive, great deal.
"
"
Le bas prix paraît un peu lors de la prise en main, mais le reste est parfait.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien. Les fonctions sont tous utilisables.
"
"
Please make the power cord more noticable. My husband thought it was battery operated. He threw the box out but didn't check for a cord. It was under the plastic holding the toothbrush
"
"
Love it! Nice and lightweight for the kids as well.
"
"
Excellent product-very happy
"
"
It keeps charged for a long time. It works well.
"
"
PERFECT, nough said - GET IT!
"
"
Value for Money. You will start noticing the difference from first use itself and would never want to go back to manual toothbrush
"
"
Got it fast and works very well
"
"
I bought a pink one. It is so cute, handy, and comfortable when using. Battery lifetime is impressive. Totally worth the price.
"
"
It works well and has multiple options of toothbrush heads. One thing I found confusing though is it pausing every few minutes when on the clean setting. Other than that it works very well
"
"
Excellent product, I brush my teeth three times a day now. I even tried to purchase for my best friend who lives in the US but unfortunately it said it cannot ship to New York.
"
"
Just got it for Christmas,  cant speak about the battery and traveling, but I love the clean it does, works amazing.
"
"
LOVE IT . Thin, rechargeable  soft brissels. Clean feeling like at the dental office. Gentle on gums.
"
"
Price is good compare to a branded one,love this toothbrush,very light and I dnt need to charge every week.
"
"
Works just great 👍
"
"
Terrific little toothbrush with a USB charger, so really compact for travel. It came with FOUR heads, which is remarkable for the price.
"
"
I’ve been using this product for 3 weeks now and i absolutely love it! Happy to have and i dont have anything bad to say about!
"
"
Sturdy toothbrush, battery has lasted well so far but I’ve only been using for a week, no charge required yet. It’s much quieter than my last toothbrush which was Oral-B.
"
"
Since I’ve received it, I haven’t charged it and it still works amazingly
"
"
Offert en cadeau a mon conjoint qui a l habitude de détruire une brosse a dent en une semaine .  Cela fait plus de deux semaines et toujours en excellent état ..très bon produit
"
"
It works great
"
"
Very happy with the product I DO recommend it !!
"
"
I love this product! My teeth feel so much cleaner after each brushing! I love the timer feature and the pauses to indicate when to switch sections are really helpful!
"
"
better than expected works great really good value-long battery life before battery charge neededhidden gem
"
"
I was wanting an electric toothbrush but didn't want to spend an arm and a leg. this one is awesome! loads of settings, comes with 2 extra heads and a flossing brush!
"
"
Dont know yet about battery however my teeth and gums never felt so good nor looked so gorgeous! ABSOLUTELY recommend this product!
"
"
Whole family loves it! Everyone has their own head. Like the timer and the polish function. My six year old likes the sensitive setting.
"
"
I really feel something different .it is a great product as compared to expensive brands. I would definitely recommend to all my known persons.
"
"
It does its job beyond what I expected. Long lasting battery. Have not charged it yet.
"
"
This brush is perfect if you’re looking for an electronic toothbrush that isn’t too complicated. You gonna feel your teeth super clean. Also the battery life is amazing.
"
"
Amazing tooth brush. I will never use any other toothbrush after experiencing this one. I bought 3 more for Christmas presents because I am sure my family members will like them.
"
"
Very good alternative to Phillips sonicare
"
"
Superb toothbrush, can compete with more expensive versions.
"
"
Kids loved them. Loved all the settings as well
"
"
I preferthis brush to my oral b electric toothbrush.  My teeth feel cleaner and my gums are healthier.  I'm very glad I got this toothbrush.
"
"
Christmas gift!
"
"
thought I would give this a try and so glad I did!! This thing is awesome! Does such a great job 👏
"
"
Happy with this purchase.  The brush head is smaller than others which I like. Battery life really good.
"
"
They stand behind their product. I’m a very satisfied
"
"
This product was amazing. I thought it could have done a bit better cleaning, but overall it was quite good (would suggest using the hard brusle)
"
"
Great Price! Works very well. It arrived in very professional packaging. Won’t be disappointed.
"
"
Très efficace pour le prix, avoir plusieurs mode c'est merveilleux. Je la conseil a tout le monde. Livraison très rapide et avant la date prévue
"
"
Faut s’habituer à la vibration qui est intense.
"
"
Very strong, great value for the cost, can already see and feel a difference after a few days.
"
"
Wow je suis surprise très efficace et bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
Satisfait de la qualité de la brosse
"
"
awesome toothbrush! battery lasts a long time and very powerful, my teeth feel super clean after. Totally worth the money. Delivery was quick.
"
"
My grandson is using it and loves it
"
"

"
"
Leaves teeth feeling and looking nice and clean. Love the timer on it because it helps my daughter know she is brushing long enough as well.
"
"
Parfait ....sa déloge les plaque et le tarte...

"
Good toothbrush and good price

"
"
Great toothbrush worth the price!
"
"
I’m very happy with the toothbrush! It’s still relatively new so I can’t speak for the battery life, but otherwise a very good purchase.
"
"
Love this toothbrush! Really good deal!
"
"
I love the sleek design. It's super comfortable in my mouth and my teeth feel like I just left the dentist. Amazing purchase.
"
"
Very happy with this purchase!!!I normally stick with name brands.But this was worth every dollar.
"
"
Works amazing. You can choose different types of mode.extra 2 brushs included for future use.Great functionality with great value and quality.
"
"
I’ve never had an electric toothbrush before and have been very happy with how well it works and would recommend it to other people.
"
"
I like that it has a timer on it. Four sessions of 30 seconds so you know to move on to the next section and brush as long as it recommended.
"
"
great deal
"
"
I really like the various settings, whitening...AND so far, it’s not hard for me to use because of my RArthritis
"
"
After a month of use it’s been working great. Excellent value and looking forward to getting good results.
"
"
La brosse à dent rechargeable est efficace, légère et garde sa charge pendant plusieurs semaines.
"
"
Best electric tooth brush I've ever had , especially the value
"
"
Had an issue with the one I got but customer service offered to send me a new one for free without asking,It is very efficient and a good deal too
"
"
Received a defective unit and they sent me a replacement unit no questions asked. Great toothbrush for the price and at par when the more expensive brands!
"
"
Works amazing! Battery life is great. All in all a great buy.
"
"
Je l’adore
"
"
Brush head a bit small
"
"
Overall good brush feel good plenty of modeAnd extra heads
"
"
The toothbrush can stand on its own, battery life is great. Love it.
"
"
Excellent achat pour ma part. Fonctionne super bien. J'ai chargé la batterie une fois et cela fait maintenant 1 mois que je l'utilise sans l'avoir rechargé.
"
"
Very nice to use. Would prefer an on the counter charging dock to the USB cable.
"
"
Excellent tooth brush. Highly recommended
"
"
I'm a dental assistant and I absolutely love this toothbrush, my teeth feel so clean and smooth after using it
"
"
A ma fille pour sa fête et elle l'adore!!

"
Its a great product, great price, and easy to use. No disappointments.
"
"
Seriously hands down.  Well built.  Works amazing.  My teeth have never been so clean. Fast charge

"
I liked the time intervals. My teeth have appeared whiter since I started using the product! I would recommend to others.
"
"
Very effective and all the heads are useful and easy to use. I can feel and see the difference after each use. I highly recommend
"
"
Love the colour and the feel of it. Fits nicely in hand and teeth felt extremely clean!
"
"
Cleans well, looks good. Haven't had it long enough to review battery life, but should be fine.
"
"
Fantastic love it
"
"
Great little toothbrush. Does everything it needs to do. Great price and fast shipping!
"
"
Bought these for my kids. They look cool and work great.
"
"
Does what it does and does it really well! Over a month and I haven't had to charge it yet!
"
"
La tête n'est pas assez puissant et la vibration est trop faible. L'impression de ne jamais bien me laver les dents.
"
"
Love this new toothbrush. I feel like it reaches places in my teeth that I couldn't reach with a manual toothbrush
"
"
Great product with an even better priceMy teeth says thank you
"
"
Great toothbrush,  does just as good if not better than the sonicare I got from the dentist a few years ago.
"
"
This toothbrush cleans so great. I’ve never felt my teeth feel so great. I would buy this product again for my children.
"
"
it does a great job cleaning my teeth, also like that it is lightweight
"
"
The brush stands without charging for a week or more since I haven’t charge yet. Good price and easy to use.
"
"
Digne d'un dentiste. elle et mince et longue donc elle se rend dans les endroits difficiles d'accès. j'adore!!!
"
"
I'm very satisfied with this purchase.
"
"
Great travel toothbrush. Very light weight.Probably not as effective as my Oral B.
"
"
I like the 30 seconds timer and 4 different modes.
"
"
Works great, cant really vote on battery life as I havent charged it yet.. good for the price and very powerful.
"
"
Works great! My teeth have never felt cleaner!!
"
"
Very good toothbrush ! dont worry

My overall thought on the electric toothbrush itself is that is is good and an excellent value for money. Far superior to a manual brush and provides good cleaning power through various modes and is aesthetically very pleasing and easy to use. It comes nicely packaged with extra heads which is a bonus and easy to understand instructions. It charges with USB which I like, especially as I travel a lot and not having to carry extra bases and cords.You can get very fancy and $$ with the Oral B and Sonicare brushes but I believe the additional dollars don't necessarily give you exponentially that much more (besides a bunch of buttons you never use).Thoughts.I would have liked a carrying case, it should be standard with all models. Somehow, the pink model does not offer a case option?Troubles.I have had two of these brushes. The first stopped working after 4 weeks which was very frustrating as I had started a 3 month trip with it. Kudos to customer service, I left a review here and was contacted promptly by Emliy who sent me a new brush and did a nice follow up. I have just started to use the second brush and so far all is good. So though the brush did stop working the company stood out for rectifying the situation and I will update this post on the longevity of brush 2.
"
"
Fabulous! It does take some getting used to, but once you find the level of pulsations that you're comfortable with, you'll love it! My only drawback is I wish the brush head was a little larger; once you apply your toothpaste and start the unit, the paste slides off from the fast movement of the brush. It takes a bit of trial and error to get the amount of paste you can apply so it won't slide off. All in all, a great tool!
"
"
I never write reviews but I’ve been using this toothbrush for over a month and I can’t get over how much of a difference it’s made.My teeth have always had this yellow staining that I could never get rid of. I’ve always just used a manual toothbrush. Since using this product I can happily say my teeth have gotten at least 3 shades whiter and I have no more staining, they are white and not yellow!At first it is hard to get use to how ticklish it feels but within under a week I was fine and it no longer bugs me. I also have not had to charge it yet besides when I first got it. The battery life is amazing!!So happy with this product I will continue to use this toothbrush !!!
"
"
Product arrived when advertised.  Kudos to Amazon for superior service.  Been using it for a week now and find it works as well as the much more expensive unit I leave at home.  In some ways, it is much nicer as it is half the diameter and weighs in substantially less.  The additional features are a welcome bonus.  If you're looking for a powered toothbrush, then look no further.
"
"
I received 2 soft bristle head brushes and one hard bristle. There was also a small interdental brush as a gift. I've been using it for 2 days and I really love it. I have very sensitive gums so I'm using the sensitive mode. It's very gentle but cleans very well. It beeps every 30 seconds and stops automatically after 2 minutes.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush and was expecting it to be crap.  I am very surprised as ti is just as good as my husbands much more expensive SonicCare toothbrush.  The battery life has lasted almost 2 weeks on one charge and it does a great job brushing my teeth.  I really like the built in timer.  Great purchase you wont be disappointed!!!
"
"
Fantastic value for money! I've had it for about a week and haven't had to charge to battery yet (brush 2x a day). Love the different settings! Will purchase more for family members!
"
"
The seller was amazing. Fast professional service. The item was exactly as described. It arrived on time, and was a very reasonable price. I bought this as a gift so I am not sure how it works, But, based on all the other experiences, I am sure will be fine.
"
"
Charged this toothbrush and its been a few weeks and it still doesn't need to be charged. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a good electric toothbrush
"
"
I was very surprised of the quality of this toothbrush. Is so quit too. I really appreciate all the different fonction! I bought it for my daughter, but i think im gonna keep it to myself and order one for her :)
"
"
I bought this for myself as i have wanted a sonic strength toothbrush but can't justify the price tag! I received it the next day and everything was as advertised.  My 7 year old was so jealous I had to order her one too!!  I highly recommend this product for people on a low budget for quality product.
"
"
It was a really surprising how good this toothbrush. I have carried it around world for like 2 months. And I only have to charge it once. It is smoothing cleaning as well. Nothing can really to complain about it.  Only thing I would ask is that they can sell a nice case with it.
"
"
Great product. Many functions. Bought for my daughter because she is getting braces.
"
"
LOVE LOVE LOVE this brush has a timer and my teeth feel extra clean
"
"
Will take some getting used to as it is very powerful , but my teeth have never felt cleaner ! Would buy again for sure.
"
"
I bought this for my 8 year old son and he loved it! Been using it for almost a month now. Easy to use, changes to different settings every few seconds .
"
"
Works great and decent price comes with extra heads will buy again
"
"
UPDATE: The company contacted me and made it right, great support and customer service.Brush heads are too small, it's like I'm using a children's toothbrush, and no matter which setting I'm using, it doesn't clean my teeth well.
"
"
My husband and I love it. We ended up buying 2.

when the toothbrush vibrate your whole hand will vibrate . i used to have electric toothbrush and  its not suppose to do that. the sound is annoying. very low quality . overall dont waste your money on this one.
"
"
Makes me feel like I have had a cleaning at the dentist every time I brush. Way better than a regular toothbrush
"
"
Bien recu. Pas utilisé encore, cadeau de Noel.
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price! I used it almost a month until it needed to be charged! I paid around $18 for it, since there was a coupon code at the time of purchase!
"
"
Great product so easy to use and understand
"
"
Soft for my gums :)
"
"
Worked as advertised.It is easy and very comfortable to use. It comes with 3 brush heads and an inter-dental for braces. Good quality for a lesser price.
"
"
My teeth have never felt so clean. Well worth it! I got it on sale for $17!!
"
"
This is a great toothbrush for the price and the features it has.
"
"
Fast shipping, long battery life and good product. I bought it with a deal. Looking forward to buy more.
"
"
item exactly as described, arrive very quickly
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Love this product.  The battery lasts a really long time.  No need to place on a base, so less room.
"
"
This is my first electric tooth brush and I am converted. Great price, great product.

100% not a soft bristle toothbrush. I posted a picture showing a soft bristle vs theirs, soft bristles are really truly very soft and very close together. What is laughable is they also send you a ""hard bristle"" head, which is the exact same tooth brush head as the ""soft bristle"" head. There is no difference whatsoever. Felt pretty misled here, since I was specifically looking for a soft bristle electric toothbrush.That being said: It's very powerful and very hard on the teeth, even if you are using a sensitive setting. If you have any enamel concerns or need soft bristles exclusively, NOT THE BRUSH YOU WANT. This thing has serious horse power, I've been waiting for the battery to die down so it doesn't rip apart my gums. And it holds battery life for a long time. If you struggle with receding gums, do not use this near the gum line, it is really powerful.Other than that, the little attachment for in between teeth is great! Will update my review after my dentist has a look at the brush! Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this as a soft bristle brush, simply because it's not.
"
"
Overall not bad toothbrush. Battery life is not great n there is no base or adapter that comes with the tooth brush. I don't hate the brush but I wouldn't buy again because for around the same price you can buy s better quality one that has it own charging dock.The company contacted me once I wrote the above review and offer to refund me or give me a new toothbrush.  So I took the new toothbrush. The customer service was very good. However the 2nd toothbrush doesnt even hold a charge for a whole day. Plus on the 2nd toothbrush the modes keep jaming. I would not recommend this toothbrush but the companys service is 5 stars.
"
"
Was pretty excited to get this but it would never turn on. After multiple full charges the buttons lighted up but no vibrations ever came...Gave it 2 stars for sleek designEDIT: I have changed my rating as I was contacted by a very lovely customer service agent and was sent a new toothbrush free of charge. They actually sent the model up so I can't comment as much on this model but the P11 has been great so far, very durable and seems like it should be worth a lot more money.  I would recommend trying the P11 over this model, it's not that much more expensive and is vey powerful. I am happy with this toothbrush and am glad they made me give Fairywill another try!
"
"
Update:After posting my review about the issues I had with this toothbrush, Fairywill quickly reached out to me wanting to fix the issue. Within a few days they sent me a replacement unit, free of charge.I'm happy to say that I haven't had any issues with the replacement unit. The toothbrush works great, gives a great clean feeling. For the price its totally worth it.Original review:I'm hoping the one I got is a one off, but the battery doesn't hold a charge. I've charged it over night several times and by evening it wont even turn on. Very disappointed, owned it for less than a week.
"
"
Ok so I bought this product based on 4.5 stars average rating. Well, I have to say I am very disappointed. This is awesome for people coming from regular toothbrush. If you are coming from premium electric toothbrushes like Braun or Sonicare you are downgrading. This toothbrush does not really brush. It is like a dildo with bristles. It just vibrates. My old Oral-B 9000 Triumph actually spun clockwise then counter clockwise very fast and you felt it rubbing against your teeth. I guess the old saying is so true.......you get what you pay for. I'm gonna fork out another $150 and buy a product that will last me another 10 years and do a proper job at it. That's like $15 per year :)
"
"
Disappointed, it doesn't really clean your teeth. It's just like a regular toothbrush but it vibrates. wish I'd spent a bit more and gotten a better brand name brush.
"
"
It looks good but too much vibration.I can barely keep it in my hand. I don't recommand for those who have sensitive tooth.
"
"
After purchasing this toothbrush I decided I wouldn’t buy anything else. Then it stopped working after 2 months...I was so disappointed.  The company made everything better by offering superior customer support and re-instating my love of the Fairywill toothbrush.  I must say this is one of the best toothbrushes...
"
"
Une bonne vibration tellement que ca chatouille la bouche...peut etre juste une question d'habitude...mes une très bonne qualité.
"
"
Loved this product till is stropped working.Bought this problem January 31 and broke just a couple of months after using it.
"
"
Great at first, but stopped working after 3 months (purchased Oct 19). Will not recharge — tried with various cables and outlets. Completely dead and useless now.
"
"
After using this toothbrush for a couple days, I honestly don't understand why I waited so long to get an electric toothbrush and throw out my manual one.I've been using the toothbrushes my dentist gave me after each visit since I was a kid. After my significant other bought an electric toothbrush and basically told me it was lifechanging, I decided to get one too.My teeth feel SO much cleaner than they did when I was using my old toothbrush, even if I always brushed my teeth thoroughly. The brush heads look pretty durable and I think the 3 ones that were included in the package will last a while.
"
"
 A friend told me about this toothbrush, and now I am talking to you about it.  I love this toothbrush with these multiple functions of brushing, from massage to polishing, it's completely crazy to see the video that I will let 😊 works very well and the battery lasts a long time, plus you have a gift  a brush to clean the most difficult things.  Here is the pleasure of brushing it's teeth !!! 🤩
"

Nice electric tooth brush for daily use and travel.I have been looking for somewhat budget electric toothbrush since most of the major brand is going to cost $100 and more. I’m glad that I found and purchase this toothbrush. It still have the same variety speed you will want 7 speeds for exactly, it all indicated on the toothbrush as you switch them in sequence. It comes with three toothbrush heads, that’s good for 3 people or 9 months with changes every 3 month of the brush head, this is very convenient. I will say the best feature is the USB charging cable  that allows you to charge it with USB adapter or power bank if you are traveling. So far with my testing the waterproof feature on this toothbrush is very good.I do recommend it for everyone!
"
"
I have been using another electric toothbrush for years and I thought I will try something new and I am glad I did.These different setting options are amazing but most of all having a sensitive setting there is wonderful having  problems with my gums as I brush too hard and too long.  I can feel the difference already which makes me happy... I love, Love, Love the little brush as I use that for cleaning between  my bottom teeth where I always have a lot of plaque...and guess what?  The plaque is gone which makes me happy and will make my dentist even more happier...I have been using this toothbrush now for 36 days and did not have to recharge it yet.The package is very professional put together and it tells me that the seller wants the customers to be satisfied  which I am...everything has it's proper place and is even placed into protective paper to be sanitized.Well done  Fairywill.  I even bought an extra set of 4 replacement brushes which are soft !!!  Nice !!!I would highly recommend this  toothbrush set.  Thank you :-)..Today is May 31, 2020 and I like to add something to my previous review...I  received my Electric toothbrush on Apr 6, 2020, brush my teeth at least twice a day and today is the first time that the charger is turning red as it needs to be recharged...this is  55 days ago that I bought it ... WOW...needless to say I am impressed !!!

I have used the Oral B sonic brush in the past.  The issue with that toothbrush it that it never lasts a year for me.  I was looking for a new toothbrush, and I stumbled across this one from fairywill.  My first response was the packaging was incredible, it's the apple toothbrush.  It's really light and super powerful.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I have only used this for a few days, but it's way better than the Oral B one.  I will never go back.The only issue I wonder about is how long will it last?  I hope the battery lasts at least a year.Pros:- Compact- Looks incredible, comparable models from brand name electric toothbrushes would cost $199.- Super powerful.- Easy to charge.- Charge last's 30 days.Cons:- I don't know how long the battery will last.- It weighs almost nothing.  I am worried it will break easily.Bottom Line:This is one of the best toothbrushes I have ever owned.  It's incredible.  For this price, you could buy three of these for the price of one of the competitors.

I've been hesitant to buy an electric toothbrush for a while because they're always so expensive, but then I found this one and I have to say... it performs way better than I expected given the price point. Only time will tell if it truly makes a difference vs a traditional toothbrush, but the same could be said of any electric toothbrush.I think the Whitening mode is a bit too intense so I keep it on Clean mode, don't really use the other modes but they're nice to have. I absolutely LOVE the 4x 30sec indicator. I find myself brushing my teeth for longer and more thoroughly than before (and I've always thought that timer was a gimmick when I heard it on radio ads from certain other products).All in all, the only thing I wish was a bit different is the size of the brush head. I wish it was a bit larger, but that's just a personal preference. It still cleans just as well I'm sure.

We have the (ridiculously overpriced) electric toothbrushes that we got from our dentist.  I was looking for something similar but a little cheaper for camp (it sure beats having to bring a toothbrush back and forth, since we often forgot and hated using the 'crappy, manual' toothbrushes we kept at the trailer.  This one was amazing.  It's pink (my son says he doesn't care because it works so well), and it comes with three replacement heads, and another tool/attachment that is great for getting stuck food out (we used this for apiece of popcorn that was stuck, and it removed it instantly).  The power is great, it's not too loud.  Definitely a great price (less than 1/3 of what we paid for a 'name' brand).
"
"
so when first opened it looks like a toy all plastic no rubber feels a bit cheap. i used it for 2 months now twice daily, the battery last a long time, i had a oralB one which inside uses 1 AA battery and outside has rubber and gets black mold after not too long. the all plastic is a big bonus. when I first turn it on the motor is strong but smooth, then i quickly realized it is a very high quality well made device. comes with 4 to 5 tips and the tips are very high quality, no degradation after 2 months. i haven't used other brand higher end models but i am pretty sure this one can compare to any other model out there. for the price and number of brushes it included this is unbeatable. i throw out my moldy ones and no need to worry this one ever get mold. don't buy anything with rubbers on it. all plastic and it is waterproof just fine.
"
"
 Very good brush very powerful it comes with 2 extra brushes and flossing tipIt has deferent modes from cleaning to massaging the gymReally well made the design is slim it hold very good in your hand.This lil brush has options that my lost Philips 140$ brush didn’t have.Also it keep the charges for a whileOverall this is the brush that gives you the most for your bucksReally surprising quality for the price
"
"
I was skeptical at first, but between my $100 oral-b becoming a useless piece of plastic trash after the non-replaceable battery died - and the great reviews here (also sometimes questionable) I thought I'd take the chance.Thus far it's worked great.  I've used it 2-3 times a day for 2 weeks off of one charge, and it certainly feels as good as - if not better than - my previous sonic toothbrush that cost more than 3x the price.The various actions seem to work well - and though I stick with sensitive (as I'm afraid 'whitening' would flay the enamel off my teeth with its power), others might find them more useful.For $30ish bucks it's a great buy.

This Fairywill rechargeable electric sonic toothbrush is compact and light weight. According to the specification it vibrates an astonishing 40000 time per minute, which has great capability to remove food bits, plaques and bacteria from teeth surface, in between teeth and even slightly under the gum line. There are 5 modes including whitening, cleaning, sensitive, polish and massage for various gums and teeth condition. I found the vibration is very comfortable to my gums and very efficient when cleaning my teeth. The 2 minutes built-in timer provides interval pause reminding each 30 seconds is a great feature to ensure correct brushing goal is achieved every day. For just $30 I think this product is a great buy.
"
"
You pay for what you get. I have always had Sonicare - and they last a long time. I was finally in need of a replacement and thought that this one looked like it was a good value and that there couldnt be much difference right? WRONG.  This toothbrush was quite inferior. It felt very cheap and lacked he power of a Sonicare which gives a powerful clean. This felt like a toy by comparison.  Although it had alot of options like - clean, whiten etc, it wasnt good at any of them. My advice - spend the extra and get a better toothbrush than this. u

A date je suis franchement satisfaite de ma brosse fairywill, reste à savoir si sa va durer, je l'espère sincèrement.L'autre que j'avais, une Phniti que j'aimais beaucoup et qui ma pétez dans face en a peine 7 mois ma vraiment fait...suez.L'avantage de fairywill est peut-être dans la protection du shaft protégés d'un capuchon de plastique, là où l'on visse la brosseà dent plutôt que de tirez/poussez et qui à mon avis n'est pas un bon système, et brise plus vite a l'utilisation quotidienne... Voilà
"
"
I had a Philip sonic care that I paid over $200. After buying this, this has been great so far.  Has all the features like the Philip and comes with 2 extra heads and a bonus flossing head.The 2 minute auto-Shut feature is great addition.
"
"
I think this toothbrush seems great, and the notion that it holds a charge for a month is awesome - but it does NOT come with a travel case.  I was a bit shocked.  The supplier says they hope to offer one soon............. so right now it's in the cardboard box that it came in (which also holds the USB cord and a couple of spare brush heads.)  I was hoping it might fit in my old Sonicare travel case, but no such luck.  So, if you, like me, are buying this for travel, be prepared to cart it around in a ziploc bag.............  :-(
"
"
Found it to be too light of a brushing, a personal preference, somewhat superficial not thorough enough. Most probably good for travelling as it's more compact and weighs less. May be more appropriate for kids. UPDATE: I have since been reimbursed for this toothbrush w/o having to return it because of my review. Supplier is obviously focused on customer satisfaction and integrity of its product. 5* for their acknowledgement! Thank you for this.
"
"
For around 30 dollars you cannot get anything better than this! The ones you find in the store or dentist can be hundreds of dollars. I decided on this because it does the exact same thing and you aren't paying for a name brand. Been using for a few weeks and it definitely works as you'd expect. Has many different settings and is incredibly gentle on the teeth yet cleans so well.
"
"
I can’t comment on battery life as I just received it 4 days ago and came fully charged.What I can say is it’s very powerful and hasn’t lessened over the 4 days.i really like the settings.i hate flossing and the extra attachment for that works really well. I have spent over 70$ on an electric toothbrush thinking brand name was the way to go but I was wrong. I love this toothbrush.and the price was amazing and it had a 10 coupon with it. 5 stars for me.
"
"
I got it today and after I tried it, I felt like I just got home from the dentist. The extra pick included is a nice bonus, along with the three brushes. All the settings on it are great. I tried a few of them today. Nice product and a great price too. It's USB but that's ok. I'm getting used to all these USB things lol  This product is way better than all the brand names I've tried.
"
"
Toothbrush is great. I did not expect such great quality and workmanship you can feel in your hands at this price.  The tooth brush has a great feel to it and has several brushing modes. My favourite addition is the plaque/floss adaptor which you can really feel working as you brush with it. This is one one my favourite and best purchases on a long time and you will not regret your purchase (especially at this price).Well done to this company.
"
"
I like this toothbrush.  You get three brush heads and a interdental head.  When i first used it on the white setting it was ticklish inside my mouth but you adjust quickly. The motor is very quiet and you have 5 settings.  You charge with usb cable but i havent need to set as i still have battery life. It says you get 30 days after a full charge.  Your mouth feels clean much better than manual tooth brushes by far.  You get value for your money and a great item for travelling.  You also have a little cover for the brush head. It is slim and sleek.  It has the 2 minute timer with 30 second interval pause reminders. I like having the different settings so you can brush and adjust as you need. I personally would like larger brush heads its always been mu preference but it does the job.  I recommend this.  I think you will like it.
"
"
This is a great travel electric toothbrush, but if your buying it for every day use, recognize it isn't the quality of the expensive brushes.  It has a high pitch somewhat annoying sound, but you get used to it.  It is very light weight - you get used to it.  I like that is pauses every 30 seconds ... Keeps you brushing a bit longer.
"
"
 I really like the design of this toothbrush, solid build quality.This is a great option for traveling, children, or new to sonic toothbrushs.I use this when on the go or at the office.Comes with extra toothbrush heads and charging cable.
"
"
I really like everything about this product, but the only thing missing is a box to put the brush after use. So if one needs to travel you will need find something to Keep it safe and germ free. I wish they offered the box to come with the product.
"
"
I'm intrigued with the general bundling and structure of this Sonic oscillating brush. It's smooth, and I like how being in pink as of now makes it stand apart from other conventional oscillating brush configuration shades of blue and white. Being the just one with a pink brush , I don't need to take a twofold take when making sense of which toothbrush is mine when imparting the restroom vanity to other people.I like the capacity to likewise switch between brushing methods of cleaning, brightening, back rub, cleaning or touchy. I discover the force between the modes on the money, presently excessively low or excessively solid on my gums and teeth.
"
"
Le rapport qualité prix de ce produit est excellent pour 30 $ une vous avez une brosse a dent qui est l'équivalent des grande marques. Super facile a utilisé et passez a travers tout les différent modes ! elle est aussi vraiment légère.
"
"
I love this brush. As a matter of fact, I have 2 . One in Florida  at our winter home and one here in Canada! I am a smoker with veneers and I saw a big difference in the health of my gums and teeth. And over time a big decrease in tartar buildup. This purchase is a no brainer.
"
"
I have just received these, I bought 3, one for myself and one for each of my kids, so far we love it. The price is great, it has all the features of the more expensive ones, so far so good. We’ll have to wait and see how it will perform over time. I will be back with an update
"
"
Multiple operation modes. Cleans well. Has a two minute timer which is helpful. Comes with a couple of spare brush heads. Has a cap which is thoughtful. Recharging is easy, packed nicely if you would like to gift. Been using it for a couple of days and I am satisfied with the performance.Shipped quickly too!
"
"
This is probably like most electric toothbrush but it is great for families as it includes Multiple head attachments.The main body and brush attachments are well made. Attachmens have different colors for easu identification. Motor has many different functions so there is something for everyone.
"
"
For it's price, it's a no brainer. Very easy to use. Many modes. I like to use ""clean"". On my 8th day without having to recharge. Runs for two minutes with 30 seconds reminders then can go another 2 minutes if you want to start again. Comes with spare brush head and a pick. Highly recommend!!
"
"
I bought myself this toothbrush - as a budget friendly step up from my manual toothbrush and WOW! My teeth have that ""dentist clean"" feeling- quite impressive. I love all the different features, as well as the 30 second pauses to remind me to switch sides. It also helps me keep easy track of the time to ensure I brush the full 2 minutes.
"
"
Great toothbrush!!  First, I would like to say that this toothbrush packaging is very giftable and well designed. It has a very high quality material and comes with multiple toothbrush heads. What makes this brush unique is the multiple modes it has unlike other toothbrush.
"
"
No case, so will hard for traveling, just received it yesterday, so far really great experience. Not sure about charge, but 2 mins brushing makes your gum smile! I look forward to brushing 2-3 times a day, when I disliked brushing. Buy it, your teeth will Thank you!!
"
"
Love this toothbrush. No better at this price. It's battery lasts for ages. It cleans well, running for 2 minutes with a pause every 30 seconds, so you spend that much time on each 1/4 of your teeth. And its black, so it fits the bathroom design nicely
"
"
This toothbrush has changed my life, within one week my teeth are noticeably whiter, the toothbrush came with an interdental attachment that I am absolutely in love with. At this price point, it is an absolute no brainer. I have immediately purchased multiple more for friends and family so they can enjoy it as well.
"
"
I love this one. Been wanting an electric toothbrush since I was a kid, and when I saw the price of this one I couldn't say no! The brush heads don't really feel any different between the others. They're labled soft/med/hard, I would like a few more mediums. The differeng settings are awesome and it feels like a great quality.
"
"
This brush has been such a wonderful surprise. It works fantastically, haven't really tried out all the settings yet but the general clean works brilliantly. Quality is great, I would say even on par with the expensive ones. I definitely recommend this brush. Battery life is great and it's so long that I can travel with it anywhere and not worry. It's light and easy to use and looks great. Five stars!
"
"
Friend of mine recommended me this brush as to get more effective results against calculus problem which I used to face while using old manual brush. Seriously using it from few weeks and it truly work’s. Clean really well and the different mode helps to manage the vibration speed at back of teeth and avoid pain at sensitive gums.Moreover, has great battery life and can carry it while going for outing without worrying about finding charging plugs to keep it running. Nice product at reasonable price.
"
"
Great toothbrush - I used to buy the expensive name brand units, but they fail after about 18 months (Sonicare). I bought 2 of these, and they rarely need to be recharges, and work just as well as the name brand.
"
"
So far so good. We bought this toothbrush to replace a one we'd bought on Amazon over three years ago that my wife and I used every day. We couldn't find the same brand, so we bought this one. The brush heads are easy to interchange and the main unit has a good selection of settings to choose from.
"
"
I’ve seemed to have misplaced my charging cord and I’m not sure how to order a new one, or if you can for that matter. I love the product but I don’t need a whole new set up. You can order brushes, so why not a charge cord? Help!!
"
"
Very well built and the material is soft. I love the fact that you can use this in the shower since it is water resistant. The modes works well depending on your preference and it keeps it at that mode when you use it again.
"
"
Finally time to replace my 15 year old sonic tooth brush and stumbled upon this option in my search...could not be more pleased at how such a budget friendly option worked AS well or better than my brand name sonic toothbrush!
"
"
The brushes are very comfortable and I can easily clean the hard to reach areas. I tried all the vibrations mode and use them all! But my favorite is ""sensitive"". The cleaning performance is great. Very happy with my choice. Thank you.
"
"
Fast delivery! I ordered this Monday and reviewed it Wednesday. I'm so happy with my new toothbrush! I love the different modes, it's also slim which makes it easier to bring when traveling . Love the color too! I like that it has no bulky charger unlike my previous toothbrush. Worth the money!
"
"
It is unlike any brushing experience you'll ever have....amazing features ,massage ,whitening,etc...easy cleaning made of superior materials....high marks on this product!!
"
"
Wow. Holy crap. Ive had a few electric toothbrushes. Mostly just the disposable battery, rotating and back-and-forth brush ones. Tried a $200 ultrasonic one from Philips. Couldnt afford that  one but this one is easily as good and only $30? I feel like I've ripped them off. Definitely worth your money
"
"
Never had an electric toothbrush, decided to get one that's not too much expensive but has a complete package. Not disappointed by this one love it! Great Clean! Good value for money
"
"
Toothbrush works awesome, came charged.Lightweight, classic look. Comes with hard bristle, soft and water pic. I can’t believe how cheap it was - I’m impressed.
"
"
Love this toothbrush!! Each setting is different, battery life is great (have had it for weeks and haven’t charged it yet). I really like how it does a quick pause every 30 seconds to help you brush evenly in each area! Definitely recommend!
"
"
This is my first e-toothbrush and I’m quite satisfied with it. Battery life is awesome and the different settings is nice to have. I wish that it comes with a travel bag but otherwise, it’s small enough to pack.
"
"
The toothbrush is great! I bought one for myself and then purchased this one for my wife.  I will definitely recommend this to anyone I know whos looking for a toothbrush.
"
"
 I really like the toothbrush. Looks and works perfect. The battery life is really good so far. Highly recommended
"
"
I’ve only had this a day and I am in love!!! It works amazing and you can feel it working. It’s not bulky like other electronic brushes.  I will update on a month.
"
"
This toothbrush actually made my teeth look whiter after the first use! A great product with an affordable price. It works way better than a brush that I bought that was 3 times the price. So happy with this purchase!
"
"
My teeth feel nice and clean after using this toothbrush. It works very well for the money and does  a great job. The battery is pretty good too.
"
"
Everything is packed well, you can buy for a gift, the box is sealed, good product, much cheaper and same functionality as more famous brands. Satisfied
"
"
It's the little things that make me happy, like the tab on the seal that allowed me to easily open the box.This new toothbrush seems awesome.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I had been using a regular toothbrush for a couple months since I had to toss my electric toothbrush. In that time my front teeth started to have some staining and after 2 days of using this toothbrush it's hardly noticeable. My teeth feel and look amazing. Hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used.
"
"
The battery life is quite long. It's much lighter and more manageable than a Sonicare because it doesn't have the internal charger and it cleans as well as the Sonicare too.
"
"
Just WOW! Fantastic toothbrush, great features and battery life I would highly recommend this product it can be compared to those big name products in quality at a fraction of the price.
"
"
Very good price the exact same electric toothbrush in the store costs 2-3 times as much. Gives you a nice clean and comes with extra brush heads
"
"
Love it so much ordered a second one for my daughter and my son is using mine with one of the extra heads. Felt like I had been to the dentist for a cleaning. Would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants a clean mouth.
"
"
It's good easy to use very soft main thing it's cheaper than very expensive electric brushes easy to clean after use safe for your teeth clean properly
"
"
My husband loves this toothbrush will buy again
"
"
Works great and it has different features that can clean the teeth properly. Also extra brushes.worth buying it.
"
"
It's alright for the price  but if you are moving  from Philip Sonicare to this  the only difference is the aggressive vibration from Sonicare  vs Fairywill (milder vibration )speed intensity for Fairywill is faster as well.
"
"
The toothbrush is powerful and compact. However, the best part is that the tips are really easy to change.
"
"
This is clearly the best price/efficiency ratio that you can get.All 5 modes works perfectly. You get a great cleaning for 2 minutes (4 X 30 sec).Do not hesitate You can't get a better deal.
"
"
Purchased for my boyfriend. He LOVES this toothbrush. He rants about how great his mouth feels!!
"
"
This baby works great, travels well, and leaves my teeth feeling amazing.Definitely a great buy!
"
"
Bought it as an xmas gift.  Reports back are that it works well and a must buy.  I might buy one for myself.
"
"
So far, clean teeth better than traditional toothbrushes. 4 stars because I just got it but love the product.
"
"
These toothbrush is great!  Lasts a long time, charges fast.  The different ends are nice.  Really great price too.
"
"
Bought this for travel and so far it AMAZING!!! LOVE THE DIFFERENT HEADS AND that it's USB when you have no electricity power and just a power pack.
"
"
First brush  and very impressed!Seems good quality good everything. No complaints here.
"
"
I really like the product. I haven't used for traveling,  but it will be handy as the battery goes for a while once it is charged. So far I am satisfied and I purchased one more. For the price it is great value.
"

Works extremely well, better than the Phillips that I had previously.
"
"
Good valueGood for the tech in the familyWould have liked more settings
"
"
Works well  30 seconds timer, very powerful and extra head replacements.Replaced my old oral b.Very happy with it so far.Light and charge supposed to last 30 days.
"
"
Awesome. Love this product. Teeth feel so clean after brushing
"
"
Seems to work great for now, and at that price, pretty hard to beat!
"
"
A great toothbrush and alternative to the expensive brands. Easy to use and has lots of functions.
"
"
It’s really impressive brush for the cost. Quality is really nice only thing lacking is tongue cleaner. Battery life is great. Come with 5 different modes.
"
"
i think it is good- it's strong so i use the sensitive mode and works great!
"
"
Great toothbrush amazing as advertised... would recommend to everyone!
"
"
Works just as good if not better then other ones I have had

Bought one for myself and it was great.  I order one for each of my boys as well.

Very comfortable

I bought this for myself, (then received the OralB spin brush as a gift, which I much prefer) so I gave it to my son.The vibration works very well for his braces and cleans MUCH better than his regular toothbrush! Especially since he is not the best at cleaning his teeth lol! I am happy this electric toothbrush is getting the job done better!Love that it came with so many replacement heads and the charge lasts for a significant amount of time.Personally I prefer a rotating head rather than just the vibrating, I feel it gives a deeper clean, but that is a personal preference.To sum up: I got my delivery quickly, the product was exactly what I expected,  it looked and worked just as advertised.Excellent  value for your money (You can’t find a better deal, definitely not one that will provide so many replacement heads)!I would recommend this product if you like a vibrating toothbrush head and a bright white smile😁
"
"
Awesome product. Multiple settings, additional brush heads. Love it! My teeth have never felt and looked so clean
"
"
Great price for a amazing price. Works perfectly for any age
"
"
Love it and I agree with all the other reviewers. Amazing!
"
"
I recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Love it
"

Great toothbrush

Quite possibly the best manual toothbrush I ever used.The brush head is slightly larger than other brushes I've used before.  I supposed that could translate into more surface area coverage and less brushing time required.  The bristles are truly soft and gentle on your gums and the cross bristles leave your teeth feeling super smooth like you came from a professional cleaning.The tongue scraper seems to be the only flaw of this brush.  The ridges are too small to really scrap anything and just seems to glide smoothly over my tongue.  Easier just to use the brush side.Pros:- Does an excellent job- Comfortable to hold- 2 pack means your significant other can rotate their brush at the same interval as youCons:- Not the cheapest brushes- Tongue scrapper could be better
"
"
I feel like this is the most expensive manual toothbrush, but it's worth it for me. The head on this is so large and full (without being uncomfortable in your mouth) and I can feel how it is cleaning more of me teeth than other brushes. I have one tooth that is a little oddly shaped, and it was always yellower than the other teeth. It has come into line with the rest of my teeth since I started using this brush
"
"
Gets between teeth well and does an excellent job removing plaque. I've had this added to my subscribe and save for 2 years now and order a new brush every 6 months. 0 issues.
"
"
Brush head is very large. Took awhile to get used to. My husband likes these, but I would probably not buy them for myself again. Good price though.
"
"
They're tooth brushes... works as it should 👌
"
"
Can't go wrong for the price, good toothbrushes, but as with all soft bristle brushes they may need replacing more often than medium bristle. Best choice for healthy teeth​ and gums though.
"
"
I’ve been using oral B toothbrushes before and it never fails to give you that squeaky fresh clean even without a separate tongue cleaner.
"
"
My fav toothbrush
"
"
These toothbrushes are great.  I am extremely happy with them and would definitely purchase again!

Brush i have ever tried
"
"
I like it, although had initially hoped they were a bit softer like my old Oral B. Otherwise, it is still very good and feels a lot more gentle than regular toothbrushes.
"
"
They do the job, remember to always change your toothbrush every 3 months!
"
"
The bristles keep falling out. This has never happened to me before. Would not buy again.
"
"
Good product
"
"
good product delivered early and cheap
"
"
I was always looking for these brushes and at times they were not available at my local stores. Almost cheaper to buy the two pack than one at the store.
"
"
Exactly as I was expecting..
"
"
This toothbrush makes brushing my teeth something I look forward to doing.
"
"
they work  greeat
"
"
It's not the best toothbrush but it's oky for the price. Handle is bulky not slick.
"
"
After the first brush, the brush hairs started to look as if I have had it from 6 months and weren't strong again
"
"
Love these brushes. Large enough but not too big
"
"
Good
"
"
good
"
"
These are great!!
"
"
nice wide brush head
"
"
works as one would expect a toothbrush should
"
"
The best toothbrush I've ever bought.
"
"
Hubby liked this toothbrush but I found them too big.
"
"
The best manual brush
"
"
Meh...
"
"
Exactly what was expect
"
"
I am really satisfied with my purchase of these two Oral-B high-end toothbrushes. They clean my teeth with ease, removing all the plaque and build up that may form. If you are looking for a higher-end manual toothbrush look no further.
"
"
Personally the best toothbrush I ever owned, the size and feel to it is amazing and gets to all areas no problem! It comes with two toothbrushes and they last very long. I wish they added a better tongue scraper on the back to make this even better!
"
"
Great brand, does the job well.
"
"
This is the best manual toothbrush I have ever used; and I have used a variety of diferent sizes, shapes, and materials over the years.It is comfortable and does a superb job cleaning the teeth.  My hygienist was astonished at the improvement in my plaque and tarter levelssince I started using the brush.
"
"
Very good toothbrush at a good price, I like that the head of the brush is a bit bigger than average. My only complaint might be that most of the time I send up with a set of brushes that are the same color making it hard to tell mine from my husbands.
"
"
The only toothbrush I will purchase and will pay what’s needed. This is a good price so all is well.
"
"
Not really happy.. I still like my old one which I have purchased from Walmart. This one little hard tho. Better pick from the store itself
"
"
Bought for a donation to a women's charitable org which donates to abused and homeless women
"
"
These are really good toothbrushes.Even my dentist told me these are really good toothbrushes.They really get into places and clean my teeth.These are really good toothbrushes.
"
"
I brush my teeth.. Chee Chee cheese chchcheee  I brush my teeth!!
"
"
These are actually a bit larger than your standard toothbrush head, which I quite like.Great add-on item, and the price is much better than going to a store to pickup.
"
"
ok
"
"
good
"
"
Highly recommended.
"
"
favourite (manual) toothbrush. my mouth feels clean! the side bristles do a great job at massaging my gums and getting the backside of my mouth.
"
"
Cheaper in store but not by much. At least you are saving gas money. Love the toothbrush!
"
"
This is a good toothbrush, it seems to be doing a good job at cleaning teeths however ive tried other toothbrushes with much better tongue scrapers. The toothbrush is also very large, which might be good for some but in my case, it doesnt fit in my toothbrush-holder...
"
"
Will continue to buy.
"
"
These toothbrushes clean very well, with minimal effort.
"
"
Great Brush
"
"
They work very well
"
"
Great deal.  Local stores sell single brushes for the same price.
"
"
Good quality but the handelling part is a little bit bulky.
"
"
Great toothbrushes.
"
"
They last, are comfortable and seem to get the job done well!
"
"
Best one to get for sensitive teeth
"
"
nice soft and fat toothbrushes!
"
"
Teeth feel clean
"
"
This toothbrush has really large surface area compared to other brushes and it just feels so right and perfect
"
"
Awesome. Love it
"
"
I really like this toothbrush. It is nice and wide and lasts a normal amount of time.
"
"
Efficacité moyenne!
"

Before I got this brush my teeth were black as mud. Now after two days they're whiter than skin milk and I haven't even taken it out of the box. What an amazing piece of machinery. I'd write more but women are parachuting in from foreign countries to date me and I have to get ready.
"
"
For the price, it’s a basic sonicare toothbrush that works well. It is missing some of the features of the more expensive models, but is also at a much better price point.
"
"
Comes fast and works great.
"
"
Good value for money

This is the hardest ""medium"" toothbrush I've ever tried. I ordered the Oral B Contour Clean toothbrush in medium and boy, are my teeth and gums regretting it! The bristles are very stiff and harsh despite using the softest amount of pressure. Although my teeth feel very clean, which is great, I have thin enamel already from my teenage years of brushing too long and too hard. Even so, I don't think anyone should use this toothbrush if you value your teeth and gums!
"
"
Quel exposé vous ferais-je pour décrire le confort acquis avec cette brosse à dents ?.:))))... En fait, l'achat était plus pour faire damner mon fils qui ouvre toujours mes envois avant moi ! :D
"
"
I ordered the cavity defense toothbrushes but received the deep clean version instead. I do not really like the deep clean ones because I find the heads of the brushes to be very bulky.
"
"
Needed a new brush and got it delivered and works like any toothbrush great value
"
"
I had a dollar left on a voucher and added this to the order. Such small purchases help out a lot in the long run.
"
"
not very impressed with this toothbrush. i found the bristles too soft. i will be buying a different one right away
"
"
Not too hard on the teeth and gums, and it cleans my teeth like it's supposed to.
"
"
I found poor quality first time ever. Pack is nice but brush is not good. Looks like a fake one.
"
"
The brush head is huge uncomfortable to use
"
"
Good quality,  reasonable price

Wears off too soon. Should be durable enough to last a month or two (used twice a day)
"

Brushes are firm and not too soft. This allows me to clean my teeth properly. Very good value for $1.50.
"
"
As expected
"

Merci d'avoir mit 2 couleur différente.😆

It's a toothbrush. Brushes my teeth. How could you go wrong!?

Bon produit, pas cher

Good

It's kinda on the soft and small side of things. Aka, not manly enough.
"
"
great product works great!
"

Great toothbrush, it is one of my favourites and worth the price. As an adult I absolutely loved the glitter, and it is a great shade of blue.
"

achat comme prévu

It cleans your teeth, it works
"

It works fine.

Not good for sensitive teeth

Great product and does what the product description is.

Thank you

Spend a bit more and get. Better toothbrush. Soft. Flimsy. Not ideal.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
Made my teeth clean.
"
"
don't think this was intended for children
"
"
Good and sturdy.
"
"
Good no problems
"
"
too hard on gums and teeth
"
"
Cheap and works great.
"
"
tooth brush was exactly what you would expect from an oral B toothbrush. Excellent bristle quality and it feels comfortable in the hands
"
"
Good value toothbrush. Small enough to fit in hard to reach areas. Weighs almost nothing. Medium bristles clean well. Bought 2 and they arrived in red and green. Would like to know other  colours available. Still, good brush for the price and will likely get one every 6-8 weeks since they are so inexpensive.
"
"
This is a great medium stiffness brush. My only problem is that the actual part you put in your mouth is slightly too large for me so that took some getting used to.
"
"
Nice large head, much better than a standard brush. Waiting for it to be stocked again
"
"
It works.
"
"
parfait!
"
"
Average brush
"
"
I actually use an electric toothbrush but I bought 4 of these to have on hand for when guests stay with me and have forgotten their toothbrush. (I swear I give away 4 of these a year for that reason.)Anyway, I was out of toothbrushes and I had company coming. For $1.49 each as an add-on item (at the time of this review) this totally saved me from shopping around at local stores, since I already know it's a good price and I've always been happy with Oral-B toothbrushes and products in the past.Happy me!
"
"
I usually use an electric toothbrush, but I gave this one a shot for vacations. It is on the softer side for a medium, which is not a bad thing at all, you shouldn't brush too vigorously anyways.
"
"
affordable thanks. shouldnt be used on a daily basis since electric ones are better but this is great for travel
"
"
Kinda too soft, but that’s all they seem to make nowadays so...  otherwise a great brush
"
"
Your standard toothbrush, no complaints here.
"
"
Not the best, but not the worst.Brush itself works fine, but the handle is NOT easy to grip, especially with wet hands.
"
"
Bought for an upcoming vacation to leave my electric toothbrush at home. Looks fine for my needs
"
"
Not bad works. Little bit soft. Will do the job. Very good price.
"
"
I bought these brushes for my daughter. She asked for them over other the other design also made by Oral B. I guess she is comfortable with this design.
"
"
Just what I wanted :)
"
"
no problem, works well
"
"
Does the job
"
"
Does what it should it cleans the teeth. Great brand
"
"
Good brush not so hard on gums .effective cleaning.
"
"
Good deal
"
"
Very thin handle and hard to grip while in use.
"
"
Good firm toothbrush for its price.
"
"
Loved it
"
"
parfait

Beaucoup trop dure.
"

It brushes your teeth... 5 stars?
"

works fine
"

It's a tooth bush
"

price ok

I really didn't expect this to be as good as the price would normally reflect but you really get a bang for your buck with this product. It is stiff, which is absolutely necessary in a toothbrush, and it cleans really well. I have braces now and I expect this to last longer than the one I had before it, but even if it doesn't it works so well that I don't mind replacing them even sooner just because of how cheap they are. I'm so pleased that I can get this online instead of paying double - or more - for a toothbrush at the grocery store. I like the thin handle and the thick bristles and the price most of all. If you need a toothbrush, get lots of this one because it's the only kind you'll ever need.
"
"
Love Oral B but the price is quite expensive.  This time buying at Amazon I can't believe the price!  I already recommend to a friend to start buying to Amazon instead!
"
"
really good tooth brush this one is so much more comfortable to use and hits all the spots
"
"
Good toothbrush, great price.
"
"
Seems to be fine thks
"
"
Totalement satisfaite
"
"
Good feel on the bristles, would recommend.
"
"
At around $15 this toothbrush works great. No idea who buys these $200 electric toothbrushes (Bluetooth on a toothbrush - really?!) but this one does the job just as good as it uses the exact same brush heads as the more expensive models.Extra benefit, it runs on removable AA batteries so I don't have to worry about some build in battery die on me, effectively making the entire toothbrush worthless. I simply use rechargable AA batteries which means I can swap them whenever I need and have no charger taking up precious sink counter space.Great value for the money (and yes it cleans well)
"
"
This is exactly what you would buy in a drug store or big name store for half the price.Prices ranged from $23 on sale to $37 full retail.  Exactly the same product not a knockoff.Plus it came with batteries so you can use it right away no hunting to see if you have 2 batteries.At $15 money well spent.I suggest getting the replacement heads for an additional $15.  They come in a 12 pack so even if you like to replace the heads every month you're good to go for a year.Cheaper than buying manual  toothbrushes and better for your oral health.
"
"
Excellent grip. The nice rubber grip is a big enough selling feature on its own. No matter how wet my hands are the power switch is so easy to turn on and off. Compared to my old spinbrush this unit has so much more power. I'm starting to get use to the smaller head but if i couldn't its nice to know I can switch to a longer type head. At the purchase price of under 13 bucks I have to give this brush big thumbs up.
"
"
Love the timer, and that I can get to those hard to reach places. Batteries are useful since I travel overseas a lot and cannot use a rechargeable one.  Just wish the replacement heads were more readily available at stores, or atleast interchangable with the heads for the rechargeable toothbrushes.
"
"
Much cheaper than a $200 electric toothbrush that clutters up the counter with its charger. It works very well, is easy to handle and I am therefore very satisfied with my purchase.Advantages: you can easily get different brush heads in pharmacies or online. I personally have a few sensitive teeth so brushing with this brush was a little inconvenient at first. I bought a head for sensitive teeth and that's it! Also, 3 small shakes that tells you the recommended brushing time.Disadvantage: works with 2 AA batteries. You should therefore plan to change the batteries from time to time or use rechargeable batteries. That said, the batteries work for a long time (rechargeable for my part) and as mentioned above, it avoids having to have a charger on the bathroom counter.*UPDATE : after 1 year and a half of use -> it still works very well!Overall rating : 4Scores awarded in each category :• For travelling (5)• Value for money (4.5)• Battery life (4)----------------- Français -----------------Bien meilleur marché qu'une brosse à dents électrique à 200$ qui encombre le comptoir avec son chargeur. Elle fonctionne très bien, est facile à manipuler et je suis donc très satisfaite de mon achat.Avantages: on peut facilement se procurer des têtes de brosses différentes dans les pharmacies ou en ligne. J'ai personnellement quelques dents sensibles alors le brossage avec cette brosse me dérangeait un peu au début. Je me suis procurer une tête pour dents sensibles et le tour est joué! Aussi, 3 petits tremblements qui vous indique le temps de brossage recommandé.Désavantage: fonctionne avec 2 piles de type AA. Il faut donc prévoir de changer les piles de temps à autre ou utiliser des piles rechargeables. Ceci dit les piles fonctionnent longtemps (rechargeables pour ma part) et comme mentionné plus haut, ça évite de devoir avoir un chargeur sur le comptoir de salle de bain.*Mise à jour : après 1 an et demi d'utilisation -> elle fonctionne encore très bien!Évaluation générale : 4Notes attribuées dans chaque catégorie :• Pour les voyages (5)• Rapport qualité-prix (4.5)• Durée de vie des piles (4)

We bought these toothbrushes on a road trip and also because we wanted to get a sense of how different it might be to use an electric toothbrush.  They worked well enough that we now have more upscale toothbrushes at home.  I can't say I'm a fan of the round brush head, even tho' they get great review.  Somehow, they don't seem to get things as clean as the traditional shape.  These are just fine for traveling though, except for a couple of minor things. If weight is an issue, they are a bit heavy as they have batteries. Also, they aren't the quietest gadgets going & we stayed in some B&B's where I wondered if the noise was bothering someone still sleeping in the next room! ;)... however, I was assured by the other guests that it wasn't a problem!
"
"
Better than the Oral-B Battery Power toothbrush in my opinion -- it cleans better and the head isn't big so it's easier to clean at the back of the molars. I prefer AA battery toothbrushes because rechargeable AA batteries are cheaper long term and I can replace them without having to charge the toothbrush -- just pop it in and you're ready to go. I've have built-in battery ones but once they die out, they're hard to replace.
"
"
I dont know what I was waiting for.  This is great.  I dont know how long battery will last but it cleans well and I am very happy with it.  I like that it is battery operated so easy to carry with you when traveling.  I wish it came with a cover but I'm satisfied with it.
"
"
I like the fact it runs on batteries. I do not have to carry the chargerand somehow find an outlet to use. If it runs down, replace the batteriesand you back in business right away.
"
"
I definitely like this purchase! Much better than a manual for sure. Think the only downside is the use of batteries but new that when purchased item.  Might need to invest in some rechargeables. The 2-minute timer is great. Great purchase!

That said, the batteries work for a long time (rechargeable for my part) and as mentioned above, it avoids having to have a charger on the bathroom counter.*UPDATE : after 1 year and a half of use -> it still works very well!Overall rating : 4Scores awarded in each category :• For travelling (5)• Value for money (4.5)• Battery life (4)----------------- Français -----------------Bien meilleur marché qu'une brosse à dents électrique à 200$ qui encombre le comptoir avec son chargeur.

We bought these toothbrushes on a road trip and also because we wanted to get a sense of how different it might be to use an electric toothbrush.  They worked well enough that we now have more upscale toothbrushes at home.  I can't say I'm a fan of the round brush head, even tho' they get great review.  Somehow, they don't seem to get things as clean as the traditional shape.  These are just fine for traveling though, except for a couple of minor things. If weight is an issue, they are a bit heavy as they have batteries. Also, they aren't the quietest gadgets going & we stayed in some B&B's where I wondered if the noise was bothering someone still sleeping in the next room! ;)... however, I was assured by the other guests that it wasn't a problem!

Better than the Oral-B Battery Power toothbrush in my opinion -- it cleans better and the head isn't big so it's easier to clean at the back of the molars. I prefer AA battery toothbrushes because rechargeable AA batteries are cheaper long term and I can replace them without having to charge the toothbrush -- just pop it in and you're ready to go. I've have built-in battery ones but once they die out, they're hard to replace.
"
"
I dont know what I was waiting for.  This is great.  I dont know how long battery will last but it cleans well and I am very happy with it.  I like that it is battery operated so easy to carry with you when traveling.  I wish it came with a cover but I'm satisfied with it.
"
"
I like the fact it runs on batteries. I do not have to carry the chargerand somehow find an outlet to use. If it runs down, replace the batteriesand you back in business right away.
"
"
I definitely like this purchase! Much better than a manual for sure. Think the only downside is the use of batteries but new that when purchased item.  Might need to invest in some rechargeables. The 2-minute timer is great. Great purchase!
"
"
I purchased this Oral B a little while ago, I remember buying one about a decade ago and paying so much for it, it was also one that had to be ""recharged""  so always had to remember to put it on charge. I couldn't take it for traveling and the charge didn't last that long.When I saw this one here, and the fact that it had just simple, regular batteries I thought I would try it.Well it turns out the be so much better that the ""rechargeable"" one that I had before.At least I can take it with me when I travel, I just have to make sure I have good batteries for it.It also cleans my teeth just as well as the other one.I would highly recommend it.
"
"
Bought this for use while travelling.  it's good for that purpose but it's not very powerful - even with new batteries - and therefore would not recommend it for regular use at home.  The rechargeable version of the same toothbrush is better for daily use.  This is fine though for what we bought it for.
"
"
I am many weeks in and still have not replaced the batteries!  The toothbrush really cleans my teeth well ! I do not use my tarter remover at all anymore as I do not have tarter buildup anymore with this toothbrush.  Because it does scrub hard, I only use before bed to protect my gums. I use a normal tooth brush in the morning.  I have not replaced the head yet so I cannot say how easy it is.
"
"
Edit: my first purchase was above my expectations, so I reordered . But the new brush just died after 2 days, maybe I got a lemon . I will update this review.OriginalAmazing product! Its movement is not too vigorous as my previous brush and the bristles are very comfortable. Easy to handle with changeable batteries. Affordable and good quality product.However its a little too powerful to what I prefer. Cleans well though
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I had one a long time ago, and recently decided to get it again. It literally gives you a full mouth clean. I feel like it cleans my teeth with ease.Would never go back to a regular toothbrush again.Plus, you can buy replacement heads for it, so you don’t have to toss it after this one wears out.
"
"
Nice toothbrush, fraction of the cost of other expensive electric toothbrushes and works well. Are these suppose to have water inside the toothbrush head/stem after every use? I end up having to remove the head to take the water out on every use which would have been more convenient if it didn't get stuck inside. Other then that, could have been a 5 star.
"

I purchased the Oral B Pro Health Dual Clean Power August 17, 2018 and a few days ago it turned on by itself and I could not turn it off using the button.  I had to take out the batteries for it to stop.  I also noticed that the cap at the bottom had a crack in it.  I hadn't noticed this before so perhaps both problems are related (happened at same time).  I am usually a pretty observant person so I think I would have noticed the crack if it happened before.Also, from the beginning I found it very hard to take off the cap at bottom (to change batteries) and put it back on.  I would not suggest purchasing this product for this issue alone and especially if you have weak hands.I bought ""standard"" Oral B replacement brushes from Costco.  I found they were not as good as the brush I got with the original purchase.  This was another disappointment and lead me to wonder ""why"" P&G would sub par replacement brushes.  I would expect the exact same experience with replacements as with the original.For all these reasons I would NOT buy this product again and would not recommend it to others.  I have written P&G to ask for a refund or replacement.  I believe the warranty is 2 years.  We'll see how that goes...Follow-up: I contacted company with my complaints and they gave me a full refund.  Client representative was very nice and only needed to see my amazon electronic receipt.  I bought another Oral B (Vitality Floss Action) so am hoping this one will be better.
"
"
If you have rechargeable batteries this tooth brush is the best option for the money and should last you 4-6 weeks before changing your batteries. The Oral-B with build in rechargeable batteries will only last 5-7 days in comparison for way more expensive. Works very well and clean you teeth very well.
"
"
I bought this as a replacement for an plug in electric toothbrush I have had for many years that finally stopped working properly.  I really like this battery one.  It works very well.  It is fairly lightweight and a great size for travelling.  It is a great buy.
"
"
This was my very first electric tooth brush. It works great and I can never go back to the regular tooth brush.The only downside is the noise. And also I don't like that it has a timer that tells you after 2 mins, but this might be rather useful for some people.
"
"
I had this exact model toothbrush for many years now. Usually last at least two years (of course your have to change the batteries and the headbrush regularly). I definitely recommend it. It's way cheaper than the one with internal rechargeable batteries and it does the exact same job.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush having some doubts because I had tried the “cheap” electric toothbrushes in the past and they where just ok. This toothbrush is amazing for the price you pay. I’ve only been using it a little over a week so can’t comment on battery life or longevity. I did notice a slight rattle develop after about 5 days that comes and goes but doesn’t seem to change the way it works. I’m ordering one for my husband now because he is jealous.
"
"
This toothbrush is definately superior to the brands I have purchased and the cost is more than reasonable.  This product exceeded my expectations. Continue to use a good quality battery and you will not be disappointed.
"
"
I've had the rechargeable ones for years but at this point I believe I prefer this one. Also the blister pack makes a wall hanger for the brush beside the sink. Remove the plastic blister and stick the very top tab to the wall with a little Goop.
"
"
As a cheap electric toothbrush I decided to give a try, never used before, this is not just cheap, but does the job very well, the external battery is basically to avoid the 1 year dead internal battery that others will give to you, also compatible with those packs of generic brush heads!
"
"
I've been using this model since 4 years ago. We currently have three at home, one for me, one for my wife, and one for my dog. It costs so little compared to fancy ones, so when it becomes moldy, I can simply throw it away and buy a new one. I don't buy the concept of expensive ones, because none of them would replace daily flossing.
"
"
I really like this toothbrush.  My teeth feel much cleaner and I like the 2 minute timer as I never go that long if I brush manually.  Considering you get 2 batteries plus 2 brush heads I think this is a great deal.
"
"
Really enjoyed this so far, my dentist recommended that I switch over to an electronic toothbrush and after a few days i defintaly noticed a difference on the back and top gums of my teeth. Significantly whiter
"
"
So far this has been a great product and you can't beat this price! I love my electric toothbrush and the battery powered I find is better for storage then the electric. No chords cluttering up your bathroom space! My teeth always feel extremely clean after brushing and thus far the battery has worked great. I only gave it four stars for travelling as it's a little bit bulkier, but that's to be expected.
"
"
Have always been a fan of electric toothbrushes.  This one doesn't disappoint. Great travel or overnight toothbrush. You don't have to worry about plugging it in. I would definitely buy this again.
"
"
Battery last well with this brush. A lot cheaper than buying at grocery store and/or pharmacies. If you. An try to replace head about every 3-6 months. Still works well after this point, but would recommend changing brush head when bristles start to significantly fade.
"
"
This is a great travel item!  Also great for home use.  I bought mine for travel as it is too hard to take the electric toothbrush on vacation. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about their teeth.
"
"
So I've only had it for almost 3 months and it has already stopped working. I've tried changing the batteries but it still doesnt work. Not impressed. Won't buy again.
"
"
Bought this a few months ago and could never go back to a regular toothbrush! Super easy to use, pretty decent battery life (only changed once, after 3 months of consistent use). It’s a little loud but not bothersome. Also the cheapest on amazon! Definitely recommend.
"
"
The head randomly stops spinning while im using it. Trying to change the battery but it's a huge struggle to get the bottom cap off. So annoying. Gonna have to switch back to a manual toothbrush or one that charges rather than uses batteries
"
"
We bought two brushes. I initially enjoyed the level of clean, however my motor died within the first two months. My husband's died after he changed the batteries and the  battery door broke. Certainly not worth $15 each.
"
"
Received this product and it looked great but simply doesn't work. Tried 8 different batteries and none will give it any power. Very disappointing.
"
"
 First one had a broken head after a month. Now the second one makes weirds stops and is unusable. Don’t waste your time on those cheap ones.
"
"
Love this toothbrush. Need something with power but that wouldn’t break the bank. Noticed a difference after the first brush. Would definitely recommend!
"
"
Switched over from a rectangular tooth brush head and I love the small circle so much more. I feel like I actually get every tooth this way and it has a timer so you know when you've brushed for an adequate amount.
"
"
Great for travel we loved the replacement feature and ordered our second pair for hubby as well . Does the job replacement is not very expensive .
"
"
When I got the toothbrush I didn’t realize it was battery only. I must have missed this in the description because I had thought it was rechargeable.I would give 5star if it said this in the title to make it clear.
"
"
Great value for money and comes with a long lasting battery - I've had expensive electric toothbrushes before and they are a waste of money - this one does exactly what you need it to do - also having it has encouraged me to use it more frequently throughout the day
"
"
Worst toothbrush ever. How do I contact the seller. Very clunky and seemed very sluggish even after changing the batteries
"
"
C'est la 4e que j'achète et elles finissent toutes par ne plus fonctionner après 1 mois ou 2. Même quand  les piles sont changées. Le mécanisme ne fonctionne plus 😤
"
"
I didn’t realize when buying the batteries included were not rechargeable.  The battery compartment is more difficult to open than I hoped.  Also, batteries and battery charger needed to be bought separately to keep it going.
"
"
Love this power clean toothbrush. I just wish it had a timer, I tend to keep brushing as it does  such a great job!
"
"
Worth it for the price, haven’t travelled with it yet but I’m sure they’ll be fine. Bought them for my kids, you can change the brush head so it’ll last longer then most power brushes for kids.
"
"
Tried to change the battery after changing the brush head, it doesn’t close now and since I’m travelling in Asia I can’t find it anywhere at affordable prices here, I’m so mad I’m using the hotel’s cheap plastic brushes to go by
"
"
I purchased two of these: one for my son and one for myself. We were both quite pleased, but both died in under 2 months - just days apart. We replaced batteries and did trouble-shooting, but there was no saving them. :(
"
"
Have been using this brush for over two weeks and so far the power has not diminished. Cleans teeth as advertised. Satisfied with this purchase so far.
"
"
It would only better if it had a 30 second pulse option, so you could clean each section of your mouth for equal time... but it's a great product, especially for the price! I'll be interested to see the difference/if any at next dental cleaning appointment.
"
"
Good quality, small brush works better than regular size brush. Bottom part a bit bigger and heavier, as there are 2 batteries.Can’t comment battery yet, just used for few days, so far so good.
"
"
Gros pour voyager cependant pour la maison excellente brosse à dents
"
"
Fait un aussi bon travail qu'une brosse électrique mais sans fil.
"
"
Had this toothbrush for 1 month. About 3 weeks in, the head was stopping with the slightest pressure. It made brushing my teeth very time consuming. Tried to return the item but found out I was 2 days too late. Do not purchase!
"
"
Bought this toothbrush off Amazon in September now the toothbrush doesn't work that was only 5 months would never buy this product again
"
"
Excellent, my teeth feel great after brushing. I use good rechargeable batteries ( Duracell ) so no worries of the toothbrush going bad because of cheap rechargeable batteries in the unit from factory that you can't replace.
"
"
This thing works great. Just as good as what you'd pay $100+ for. Biggest downside is having to change batteries vs recharge. But, to me, that's not a big deal.
"
"
Rechargeable version is good and available, but for travel, nothing beats the battery operated version.
"
"
Runs on batteries, no accumulator and no charger. Better to buy something rechargable.
"
"
Nice toothbrush for the price.fast shipping no issues. Great that it includes batteries
"
"
my kids first mechanical toothbrushes... works great
"
"
Gets used really quick, in less than a month it became almost unusable and I need to change the brushing head...
"
"
The battery died at least once a month, and then it just slowly stopped working to the point where if it touch anything while spinning it would stop. Back to ye old manual brush now.
"
"
The actual brush itself is very smallNot even as big as one tooth
"
"
I ordered one it arrived and didn't work. I thought at first; it was the batteries, so changed them. Nothing, dead, useless junk. So, I ordered another one and the same thing, happened. It's garbage and a total rip off.
"
"
I was relaxing an old toothbrush that was loosing its power.  This new one had only about the old one being replaced.  Feels like you are brushing at half speed.  Would not buy again nor recommend
"
"
being battery powered was great for a travel toothbrush
"
"
A great electric brush. My husband bought one after seeing mine and was very happy.
"
"
Brosse à dent avec un moteur peu performant. Il ne tourne vraiment pas assez vite. J’ai essayé d’autres piles et la lenteur est toujours là. Très déçue.
"
"
Got this for my husband. He said it feels more powerful than the other brands of that price range. He likes it.
"
"
I love these - no need to recharge and no cords.  Battery operated and it comes with batteries that ladt a long time!
"
"
I wouldn’t recommend buying this product. After 4 months of using it, it stopped working. I’ve changed the batteries but it’s no longer functioning and I will now need to buy another toothbrush.
"
"
Good price my child will be taking it to school
"
"
Poor quality. The on-off switch failed. The tooth brush starts on its own and does not stop until the batteries die. This is the second tooth brush I buy from Amazon. They both failed in the same way.
"
"
Great brush at a great price.
"
"
Local prices are ridiculous & Amazon's price was a shock!! Great price, quick delivery & happy with this electric toothbrush.
"
"
wanted to try the round toothbrush and I think I like it... very good price helps
"
"
I got it, I tried it, I'm happy with it but not really strong.
"
"
J'adore cette brosse à dents.  Nettoie bien les dents et détache les residus alimentaires entre les dents.
"
"
Bought this item twice. Both stopped working after 3 months. Apparently, they are designed to just get over the return period.
"
"
does a good job for cleaning my gum line
"
"
Cleans your teeth really well, will definitely buy it again
"
"
It's good. Battery isn't dead yet and very good to clean my teeth. Only problem is that the bristles wear out quickly
"
"
When I changed battery for the first time, the bottom cap could not be closed because the rubber ring inside gave a strong resistance. I had to use force to close it and the cap broke. This should be a design problem.
"
"
Very good value.
"
"
Mes dents n'ont jamais été aussi propres.
"
"
bon brosse a dent
"
"
My wife is very happy with it. Cleans better than manual tooth brush. Make sure you turn it on after you put in in your mouth. Otherwise toothpaste will be all over the place.
"
"
It's working just fine
"
"
Works okay though not as well as the older version I had (but couldn't find replacement heads for) with the double top head.
"
"
It works well.  Have a plug in electric toothbrush, but got this for traveling.  And works much better than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Works fine.
"
"
Very good, does the job right
"
"
Nice brush worth the price
"
"
Very easy to use and my teeth are super clean
"
"
Makes a lot of noise and vibrating, but I don't find it does much in terms of cleaning. Very disappointed that the brushes don't spin. I'm going back to a regular toothbrush. I don't think electric ones are for me.
"
"
works as expected although it took some getting accustomed to the small head. comparable price as in the store.
"
"
It’s for my godchild she seems to like it
"
"
This product works well however I found the brushes a little stiff! Price was excellent!
"
"
Works great. Happy with it. The round toothbrush cleans well. Would recommend.
"
"
Great product
"
"
love this powerful toothbrush, hope it last me a long time.
"
"
not gud i used just 5 days now not working runing stuck and run stop run stop
"
"
Going into the second year with no problems.
"
"
3 min of brushing, great product. I prefer the battery powered one as the last two rechargable units have failed in 8 months due to the battery.
"
"
I did not realize this was a battery operated product but am very happy to use this when I travel.
"
"
Works well, kids love the quite sound and fast turning brush, should have included additional brush head.
"
"
Super
"
"
not as powerful as i like it. Seems underpowered compared to my oral B braun with lithium Ion
"
"
Good
"
"
Works great.
"

Feels just like an expensive one.

I love this toothbrush. I’m on my second one now. I even bought one for my boyfriend.
"
"
Good toothbrush, baterry life is correct
"
"
Cleans my teeth.  Battery lasts a long time.  Scares the cat.
"
"
Runs on  2 AA batteries but does not seem very powerful.But it does hold a charge for a long timeWould not buy again
"
"
Powerful and effective toothbrush that does a good job of cleaning. Batteries (2x AA) generally lasts 2.5 to 3 weeks on average before needing to be changed. Removing and attaching the battery cover does require some physical strength as it's not as easy to attach/re-attach unless you apply force.
"
"
Loved this!
"
"
Came on time, and was as pictured.
"
"
Worked fine for 10 months then it stopped working. Maybe should just use disposable ones instead of this or just buy a good electric one?
"
"
My son an I like the tooth brush
"
"
never thought I can have a great electric brush for 15$! thanks!
"
"
It does a very good job, it reaches easily every teeth even behind the last ones and it does a strong vibration so the cleaning is excellent.
"
"
Très bon produit, J'aime bien je le recommande.
"
"
Very good, light and easy to get replacement heads.
"
"
Converted it into a makeshift pick, works incredible!
"
"
What an upgrade from a regular toothbrush.. teeth felt cleaner after first use
"
"
Great battery life. Good brush for value.
"
"
Great value
"

I love it...teeth feel very shiny after.

Pas assez de vitesse
"

Stop working after 1 month of used
"

It works good. I'm happy with my purchase.
"
"
better than a rechargeable
"
"
Inexpensive.Much cleaner teeth.

J’adore

My kids have used these for a year now, with no issues.  They work great and the dentist is happy.
"

Fast delivery. Very good product and price.

I love this toothbrush. It feels like I'm going to the dentist every day after I use it. I'm buying another one

The motor is so fast i pressed too hard once and my teeth fell off
"

Great !! I thought these were gadgets, but to my surprise, It really cleans better !!

Se tient très bien. Bonne qualité par rapport au prix.

Battery cover doesn't stay on. Spring pressure from batteries makes cover fly off. Returned.

It works great. The small size eliminates the chance of gagging.

Great product

Item as described. Shipping was fast and product has held up so far.

I got this toothbrush for traveling--I own a similar rechargeable Oral-B for home use. To my surprise this battery-operated toothbrush is much quieter than other electronic toothbrushes I own. It also takes the same replacement brush-head as my rechargeable, which is brilliant!As for the brush of the toothbrush, I am a petite woman and have a small mouth. The rounded brushing head is more suitable for me than the more generally available rectangular head. I am more easily able to reach my back teeth and behind my teeth.As for the brush-heads themselves, if purchased from Oral-B they are expensive, but the popularity of this style of toothbrush has resulted in much cheaper generic heads for sale as well.The only negative is that if you are worried about weight or space, this toothbrush takes two AA batteries, whereas some battery-operated toothbrushes take one. It is, therefore, heavier and larger than some other brands.

"
I am very impressed with this toothbrush. I was looking for an electric toothbrush without the clunky base that most models feature; this item fits the bill perfectly. It is just as powerful as the models that cost upwards of $100. I've been using it for 3-4 minutes, twice a day and the Duracell​ batteries I used lasted about 5 weeks.
"
"
Works so well, omg.  My previous one was one that had a base and you always had to have that plugged in and put the toothbrush on it.  It's just so much stuff for an electric toothbrush.  This one though, just pop a battery in there and you're good to go.  For the price, you're getting a FANTASTIC product.  I couldn't be happier.
"
"
Just tried it. Love that it has the 2 minute timer.. you can brush for longer afterwards (it doesn't shut off) but it'll buzz when 2 minutes is up. Like another poster said, definitely would have been nice to have a 30second buzz too. I was debating between the battery powered and rechargeable for a long time, but I think the two factors that made me want to get battery instead is that I can always buy new batteries whereas once the rechargeable stops holding a charge I'll have to get a whole new toothbrush and the fear of the rechargeable falling everywhere due to the cords etc. (eww toothbrush & bathroom floor... I'd be changing brushes every week at the rate of my clumsiness).
"
"
this worked fine for about a year. Bought it oct 16/16 and as of yesterday, it will no longer work, even with new batteries. i had to change the batteries 3 times during the year that i had it.  I used it twice a day for the year. Would only recommend if a travel brush is needed.i am ordering a new brush with a rechargeable stand. hope it lasts longer. and at least i won't have to muck about changing batteries all the time. hopefully.
"
"
Not even close to the power of the higher end cordless, rechargable models that costs 6 X as much. I was not expecting the same power as the high end models but I am still very unimpressed with this model, just feels weak when using it.
"
"
I purchased this toothbrush Jan 2016. I changed the batteries and changed the toothbrush head, but it no longer works. Has anyone else has this problem?
"
"
Perfect electric toothbrush to travel with when you are used of electric toothbrush and don't feel like going back to the handheld manual archaic toothbrush
"
"
I have only had it for a few days but so far I really like it! Great value
"
"
I use this for travel, works well, I wish it had a travel case.
"
"
cheap very very, the head is good
"
"
after one use my mouth feels so much cleaner compared to when i used just a standard toothbrush. such a good feeling 10/10
"
"
Very disappointed!  I had an Oral-B Power Toothbrush that lasted for years and years before having to be replaced.  This one, however, didn't last a few days.  It stops as soon as it touches a tooth, yet all connections appear to work correctly.  Ugh!!!!
"
"
It didn't last even 6 months and the local Oral B warranty company didn't even want to take a look to see if they could fix it as this model is not manufactured in Brazil. So what? It could be something simple to fix, but I'll never know, right?!
"
"
Ambrose (reviewer above) is right, I've got half a dozen of the Oral-B sonicare range sitting on the shelf below the sink to prove it--they no longer hold a proper charge--maybe I'll get around to removing their batteries for proper recycling, but until then, you can't even discard them in the trash.About a year ago, I searched for a model with replaceable batteries and found this. I use high capacity AA rechargeable batteries (from amazon)--and overall it is much easier on the wallet, better for the environment, and makes for a cleaner look on the bathroom counter.I took one star off for the design on the battery compartment/cap seal--there's room for improvement there, and if an Oral-B engineer is reading this, it's going to be the failure point--I can tell.
"
"
this is the prefect buy so far, and a better deal than most of buy on the market. in the earlier years, my first electric toothbrush was Oral-B rechargeable brush. it was great and worked flawlessly until its rechargeable battery died three years later. I took it apart and found out the battery was Ni-Cd which usually lasts about three years and almost non-replaceable, because the whole socket and housing holding the battery is soldered and tied down to the every possible joints. therefore, I understand that the philosophy of Oral-B is to keep us to buy their bush every three years. my second brush was a higher grade one, Philip super-sonic brush, which was great and very powerful in term of vibration frequency and cleaning ability. I like it very much and enjoy it very moment I use it. however, the time comes and it died in about four years since the battery can't be charged any more. I took it apart and found out the same thing-- A non-replaceable Ni-Cd battery was installed. everything else just worked fine. my third one was a third-party non-brand super sonic toothbrush, which is in a good price but last only six month. then, I decided to try battery powered brush, which is this guy-- two AA powered Oral-B brush--and it works just as great as the previous one according to my dentist when examing my teeth. when it is needed, just replace the AA battery, that's it. never ever to buy a new brush. so people understand the marketing and philosophy behind the rechargeable toothbrush, buy this one to save your money. by the way, I use rechargeable Ni-Cd AA battery to power my brush. two 2500 mA rechargeable batteries can last about two-three month.
"
"
I bought this product for my girlfriend because I thought it would be nice for her to have her own toothbrush when at my place and it worked more-or-less who it should have for the first bit. The battery life was pretty low and over 6 months we had to replace the batteries 3 times - but on the 3rd time, it started turning on in the middle of the night completely on its own and it woke us up out of a dead sleep and into a panic because we are the only two in the home. I guess you get what you pay for, but I hate just wasting plastic and products simply because they are built so cheaply.
"
"
Stopped working after 2 months despite changing the battery. I purchased 2 of these, one is working perfectly fine and the other turns on for 2 seconds then stops and Aftwr you turn it off you can use it for another 2 seconds once you turn it back on again. Useless. Want to return

For about 15 years, I was using an Oral-B ""Professional"" 3D Excel toothbrush. But as the years went on, the charge wouldn't last past one cleaning.  I was disappointed.I got this  Oral-B Pro-Health Dual Clean Power Toothbrush  when it was $15. I'm very happy with my decision. I wish I didn't buy that pricey rechargeable 3D Excel.What I love about this Pro_health toothbrush:(A) It's powered by regular AA batteries, which means:  1) You don't need AC power. You can pack 30 rechargeable AAs with you when you're camping for a month. You'll have body odor, but your breath will be fresh.  2) You'll never have to throw away your handle due to its internal battery not holding a charge. With AAs, you can always have energy.(B) It's so much cheaper than a rechargeable Oral-B. Fifteen bucks only! The price is so good I'm considering buying another one for my car. With another brush, I no longer have to take my bathroom's brush for when I need to brush in the car. :)
"
"
purchased for the kids, awesome toothbrushes, love the AA requirment, will be replacing my rechargable with this simply due to the fact that batteries last at least a month where the rechargable oral b needs charging at least once a week. cleans as good as my rechargable costing $75.
"
"
I've had these for my three kids for about 5 months. They work great and heads are replaceable at Costco. However, one of the toothbrushes is useable but broken--  for some reason the battery compartment wouldn't seal after changing the batteries a while back. No issues with the other two brushes, but the base of this one ended up cracking. We taped it up with electrical tape since its past the return window, and so far so good. Disappointing, but I would still buy again.
"
"
I found the same item on grocery stores cheaper than here. The rest is ok. Happy with its functionality. Great for travelling and battery is A4 easy to find and replace. Colors not unique.
"
"
Not quite as powerful as the rechargeable ones. But for the money is perfect.I’ve been using it every day for the last 5 months and it’s great, uses the same heads as the rechargeable brushes. Battery’s lasts a few weeks before It gets weak.Using aa batteries is actually a pro for me, no charger. You just put new batteries in when it’s dead
"
"
The older model when it was still made by ranir was better. This model spins slower, even with 1.6V nizn batteries it still spins slower than the old version which I have. They cheapened on the new model.
"
"
Works as it should but the battery life is atrocious. This thing will drain AA like its nothing. Consider a rechargeable AA battery for this.
"
"
I bought two for my kids. when it is working, my kids love them. However, after only 4 month normal usage, the switch on one of them is not function. you just can't turn it off, very disappointed.
"
"
Amazing feeling. Like visiting your dentist for cleaning twice a day :)
"
"
Very fast delivery and pleases with the items. Powerfull toothbrush, did not try the brush yet (reason for 4 stars) but i've purchased 2 others!!
"
"
Definitely cleans a lot better than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
price was amazing, delivery was quick.

as described , no complaints

Ironically, this item was completely different from what I thought I was ordering, and I couldn't be happier with a happy accident. Some fifteen years ago, I was given an Oral B power brush as a gift. It gave me many great years of service and owed me nothing when it finally packed it in. Hoping to replicate the experience, I ordered this item on Amazon, expecting a power toothbrush with a corded stand/charger. Turns out it's actually powered by a pair of AA batteries, eliminating the cumbersome cord running across the back of the sink, and has every bit of the power of my old one. Uses the same round head as my old one, which enables me to use my stockpile of replacement heads.Highly recommend this little rig, so much I even bought a second one for the RV.
"

Shhhhhh, don't let out the secret. This is the best toothbrush ever! Go ahead and search for the ""best electric toothbrush"". You'll find tons of articles pitting the entire Oral-B and Sonicare ranges against each other. This one never wins. The thing is - they are all extremely close. All of the product offerings significantly outperform a manual brush and they are all extremely close to each other in terms of plaque removal. It's really down to user technique more-so than the brush.Why is this the best?First - It costs less than 1/10th of some of it's big brothers.Second - It uses standard Oral-B heads.Third - AA batteries. Best feature ever!I had one of the Oral-B ProCare rechargeable brushes and it's a more powerful brush with more cowbell (3D action, pressure sense, etc, etc). It lasted a few years before the batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day. The big problem? You can't change the batteries (well you can... you have to solder out the old battery and get a special size from an electronics store). For the average person, those fancy rechargeables will need to be replaced every 3 years or so. With this one, you can just switch the batteries. As a bonus, you don't need to worry about the charge base and wires on your bathroom counter.While it doesn't have the power and features of the higher-end products, my teeth don't seem to notice, neither does my dentist.
"
"
For the price, this toothbrush is great. It's battery-powered motor and rotating bristles allow for seamless teeth-cleaning, especially in hard to reach places that typically don't get enough attention from a manual toothbrush. Also, the timer is a really nice feature to remind you when you've done the job sufficiently.My only real irk about it is the fact that is really quite noisy. It can make the teeth-brushing experience a little off-putting and more annoying than it needs to be.If you're alright with a little noise as you brush away at your chompers, then for the price and quality, it's a great option.
"
"
Love this toothbrush.  I had a lot of problem with brushing my teeth, gagging and heaving (I have a very small mouth).  This has cured my problems.  With the small, rounded brush, I can work on one tooth at a time, and even get the back ones without feeling my mouth is too full of toothpaste and brush.  Has a one minute timer on it that pulses 3 times, reminding you to move on to the lower teeth after doing the top for 60 seconds.  Just takes a tiny bit of toothpaste, so saves on that too.  This has been a great purchase for me.  Loved it so much I bought one for my husband too!
"
"
Most of the powered toothbrushes on the market are rechargeable which seems to be a more environmentally responsible choice but the problem is that once the life cycle of the battery is done so is the whole unit. More junk. These toothbrushes use AA batteries which can be purchased in a rechargeable form. You simply swap out the batteries. If traveling you have the option of preparing extra batteries or buying AAs. They use the same Oral B heads and work for a long time before replacing the batteries. And the price is amazing low
"
"
Bought this toothbrush for my autistic son.  Using a manual toothbrush, my son refuse to brush near his gum line, thus causing bleeding gum issues. Constantly fighting the manual toothbrush vs his mouth.  Using this toothbrush, my son doesn't have to move the  toothbrush back and forth, instead just hold the toothbrush in one spot and slowly move it to another. The key thing here is that my son can brush his own teeth instead of me brushing it for him.  Results is quite noticeable, I can see the difference around my son's gum lines.  Wished I purchased this sooner.
"
"
I owned one I used daily for 3 years before the contacts at the bottom got corroded and I had to replace the brush. I used rechargeable batteries. I think I got my money's worth on it so I decided to buy again. It's worth drying the stem after use so the water doesn't run down all the time. The O-ring that protects the batteries works, but it will get dirty in there, which is normal in those conditions. I think with better care my other one would've lasted longer.
"
"
I recently purchased this to replace an older brush and I just love it. Feels solid in your hand, and I like the small round head, you can really feel it getting into all the little spaces. I'm pleased with the two-minute timer feature, it pulses a few times when you have been brushing for two minutes so you know you've brushed long enough. Surprisingly I can find no mention of that feature on the packaging or online, however the brush I received does have it. Pleasantly surprised.
"
"
Great for travel overseas, do not have to carry your 120 volt charger and plug adaptors or transformers to convertto european current.The 2 AA batteries lasted me 3+ weeks for twice daily use,YMMV.I'm very happy with my purchase.
"
"
My previous one with the old design lasted a decade and still working but I replaced it due to the deteriorated rubber grip. This one with the newer design lasted a year and refused to spin normally. It is a very common problem if you check the reviews. I stripped it down and cleaned the rubber seal on the metal shaft and it works again, but for how long? This is exactly why our environments will only get worse because companies put profits above all else and we end up producing massive amount of waste and pollution unnecessarily.
"
"
I usually buy the corded version but got this by mistake.  I actually prefer the battery operated version because I don't have to deal with the charging base being plugged in.  The brush vibrates nice and smooth and seems faster than my corded version.  Update....After using it for a few months I found the batteries needed replacing after 2 months with using it once a day.
"
"
Le manufacturier devrait enlever la batterie qui ne dure pas du tout et remplacez ceci par des batteries rechargeables et c’est parfait! La machine s’arrête au bout de deux minutes exactement ce qui est très pratique car on sait toujours qu’il faut se brosser les dents pour deux minutes!
"
"
For the price this is an awesome electric toothbrush. You can really feel the difference on your teeth after you brush, my teeth feel so much cleaner than using a normal toothbrush. And it isn't too large. Would be easy to take traveling.
"
"
Les brosses à dent plus haut de gamme sont munies de piles rechargeable internes. Lorsque ces piles deviennet défectueuses, le remplacement est très complexe rendant la brosse inopérable.Quant à celle-ci, lorsque la pile devient faible, nous n'avons qu'à la changer !
"
"
For the price there really isn’t much to expect. It gets the job done but nothing special about it. It is not as strong as my 8 year old rechargeable Oral-B brush (which I had to replace since the battery died) but not too bad.Overall I’m ok with the purchase.
"
"
I also ordered this in error. I wanted a corded. It's one of those good mistakes lol. This does a much better job than the corded one ever did. I like the fact that it has no cord and no base. My teeth feel clean. I just received the product so not too sure how much battery life you get. but so far, I'm a happy customer.
"
"
These toothbrushes are excellent and worth the price. I have the plug in version. I purchased two for my young kids. My daughter said after using, that her teeth felt as clean as leaving the dentist after a cleaning. Worth buying!
"
"
Great travel toothbrush.  Standard Oral-B brushes fit.  Lots of power.  I can't comment on battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough...but heading to  England soon for a 3-week stay so I'll update later.
"
"
I’ve purchased this tooth brush 3 times and for some reason amazon batteries and energizer batteries don’t fit properly. I broke the battery cover each time. So frustrating
"
"
Keeps plaque build up to a minimum.  Far superior to manual brushing.Battery life is good: uses 2 AA batteries and from what I recall they last a few months. Depending on the user, heads should last between 3-6 months. Especially important to clean the heads thoroughly when used with kids toothpaste, which will rot inside.
"
"
Decent quality, if you don't mind there is only one brush head in there, and you have to pay for a second one after it.
"
"
The tooth brush worked for a three week then stoped working all to together on the fourth week. I even changed the battery because I though that was the issue didn’t help none will not be buying this again.
"
"
I ordered this for my husband as he said that his current Oral B that he's had for 10 years sounded like the motor was going.  He said that this one works so well that he loves it!  I am going to order one for myself!
"
"
This replaces the same unit I had for 2 years. I like it enough to buy a a second one. Battery life could be better, but maybe it’s the cheap Amazon batteries in using.
"
"
Worked for about a month of two, and it was great while it worked, but then it started stalling every couple seconds. Tried new batteries and a new brush head, but it made no difference.
"
"
My teeth have never been cleaner. Why spend more money for similar results? Yes I have to replace the battery but like... oh well. This does the job for a fraction of the price. I bought the twelve pack of brush heads too. What a steal.
"
"
I ordered this by mistake I thought I was getting a rechargble one with our the charger.  This would have been fine as I have two chargers but the old tooth brush battery is dyingI was going to return it but took it on a two week trip to Mexico and it was good for travel.  Ivan
"
"
This Toothbrush is excellent !!  It’s been really strong and I can feel the bristles going through my teeth for a extremely good clean . Love love love!  Excellent deal and love the fact that you can buy new heads when you need them .
"
"
Totally love the fact that it runs on AA batteries, cleans my teeth super well and has good battery life. I like how the head comes off easily so I can rinse and clean it well after use.
"
"
Great for travelling . No cord or charging base
"
"
Gets teeth feeling nice and clean, vibrates to signal 2 minute mark and good price. You can't go wrong.
"
"
purchased for granddaughter for Xmas. It was a great hit.  Her teeth are now being brushed without asking..& very often,
"
"
Very impressed with how well this toothbrush works, I was going to get one with a charger but I thought this was more practical, the battery lasts a long time! And the price is so cheap, it's such a steal,would buy it again
"
"
Basic battery powered toothbrush good for travel use. Interchangeable heads, easily replaced batteries.
"
"
Perfect for the price ! So glad I went with the replacement batteries. Just as great as the 80$ one but for a fraction of the price !
"
"
Seems to go through batteries a bit much but  does the job and many after market brush heads are available for it. Overall a good purchase
"
"
Great toothbrush but came with almost drained batteries. Replaced them and all was well.
"
"
This is not as powerfull as the rechargeable Toothbrush that I use at home, brush head fit both. it is great for travel with no wire and base unit.
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price. Cleans like the more expensive model. Very satisfied.
"
"
Using AA batteries for Oral-B power toothbrushes is the best way to go (instead of throwing the toothbrush away or trying to replace the internal battery).
"
"
Better than manual brush. Wish it was as powerful as the rechargeable Oral-B I use at home.
"
"
elle fonctionne très bien et bien moins cher qui dans nos magasin merci
"
"
This is an incredible toothbrush!! My teeth feel so slick and clean after brushing and the timer function is excellent!!
"
"
Wont work with 1.2V nimh batteries. Needs 1.5V. Disappointing.
"
"
Good value. The battery lasts long. This power brush provides the same functionality as the Oral B 1000 but without a rechargeable built in battery. It has a builtin 2 minute timer as well.
"
"
I bought 2 of these and both function as expected.  The timer works well.  Best of all is the price... it's cheaper than I can buy locally!
"
"
These are great toothbrushes. Bought 1 for when my husband had to go in hospital and obviously couldn't take his plug in one!  The power handle is just the right size and is great for travelling, and you can't beat the price. Love it.
"
"
Best electric toothbrush.  I don’t travel so couldn’t answer that rating.This is the second one I’ve purchased 😊I am very happy with this product
"
"
I loved that while traveling I didn’t need to plug in especially when voltage varies all over the world.
"
"
I've been using it only for 3 weeks.  It feels great after every washing .
"
"
Had to amend my rating. The toothbrush broke the second time I went to change my brush head. It's now garbage.
"
"
poor quality! not strong enough, batteries empty very fast!
"
"
A better clean, especially for arthritis sufferers
"
"
Oral-B pro-health power toothbrush is very handy for travel without the bulk. It is inexpensive and requires two AA batteries.It is faster than the Vitality, has a timer and make battery changing a breeze.
"
"
Not too bulky which is what I aimed for
"
"
parfait, mais ne se fait pas électrique
"
"
It works great, not much else to say about this
"
"
Good head for cleaning but even with two fresh, reputable brand batteries... The motor creates no brushing power/torque
"
"
Had one with a rechargeable battery that won't hold a charge after years of service.  Bought this as it uses AA batteries.  Cleans well.
"
"
As expected. Great toothbrush. A bit loud though lol. Would recommend.
"
"
Fait très bien le nettoyage et à bas prix
"
"
My kid likes it because it is not too strong like the other kind of rechargeable Oral-B (the kind thatcomes with a recharging device). This Pro-Health gives a consistent action: not too vigorous, butstrong enough for cleaning. It's also convenient since the battery can be replaced (about 2months).
"
"
Not a brush I' like too small of head and seems too powerful for my liking.
"
"
A good electronic toothbrush for travel, although I find the rotation of the brush a bit slower compared to an electric one but that is expected. For the price though, this is a good deal. Recommended.
"
"
Worked as expected
"
"
Good toothbrush.
"
"
product OK, bottom plastic battery cover cracked, hard to slide off
"
"
I hated it at first because I wasn't used to it, but now that I am, I will never go back to a manual brush!! My teeth feel way more clean using this power toothbrush.
"
"
Dont waste ur money
"
"
Works great!
"
"
As expected
"
"
It does the job
"
"
So much more convenient than a rechargeable unit;  battery lasts a long time. Especially good for travel.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Nice toothbrush that runs on double AA’s.  Works well.
"
"
4th week with the brush: Still with batteries it came with. As this is my first electric toothbrush, I cannot say much, but for my use, fits very well. Only thing I would change is to have a rechargeable battery, but this would increase substancially the price.Overall, I'm loving it.
"
"
long battery life.

Battery worn out too fast.

I switch to battery because the rechargeable is expensive.  I also find battery version last longer than the rechargeable.

It's ok. Some replacement heads for oral b don't fit.

I've had this tooth brush for a few months now, and had left it at my family house for use when I would visit home (which is perhaps 1 or 2 weekends a month). I purchased this about February, so it's only been about 8 months of intermittent use. Battery life isn't the best, as I've had to swap batteries twice in that time with little use, and the battery cap design is very poor. It's quite difficult to remove, which is understandable given the need for a water tight seal, but the plastic itself is very fragile. After swapping out batteries for a second time this past weekend, the cap cracked when reattaching it.I was original quite pleased with this tooth brush, thinking that perhaps I had avoided some of the problems listed by other reviewers, but I was hoping for something that would hold up better.
"
"
Solid little toothbrush that can use rechargeable batteries, which end up easier and cheaper to replace than the whole toothbrush when built-in battery designs end up failing.If you found my review helpful, please select yes.
"
"
Don't waste your money here. Buy locally so you will have coverage for when this cheaply made toothbrush goes, and it will. I've only had it for 4 months and changed the batteries. Now the battery cap will not lock on. I have tried repeatedly and it just keeps popping off no matter what I do. Amazon offers no contact number for a return. I am discovering that a lot of Amazon items are simply garbage. Buyer beware, not only on this item but a lot of Amazon items. I'm pretty much done with ordering on Amazon, as I've had well too many bad experiences.
"
"
I prefer these ones that can use AA's than the built in batteries that require a charging stand!
"
"
Just as described.  Like that it's battery-powered as we're out of outlet space in the bathroom. :)
"
"
Nice little brush like being able to use my rechargeble ""AA"", others have posted over the battery cover being difficult to remove but if you push both sides off the brush then pull on the cover it comes off quite easily.
"
"
This is NOT the dual clean this is the precision clean oral b tooth brush
"
"
Much better than a regular toothbrush
"
"
I was disappointed that this was battery operated and not electric charging I did not see any where in the description that it was battery operated
"
"
Broken took it out of the box tried everything just didn't want to work. It was a paper weight so I threw it away!
"

A wise consumer won't find a better value than this tooth brush.Low cost, a two-minute timer, and the motor is powered by standard batteries. The replacement brushes are on the dear side, but my satisfaction with the product is high.The toothbrush cleans well. ""Manual"" toothbrushes don't do nearly as good a job.You could spend much more money on a product with a charger and a battery that you can't service.
"
"
For its price, it is very awesome product.Cleans my teeth and gum very well, also the motor is just strong enough to clean your teeth without hurting gum.Battery lasts quite long time as well.Great purchase, got another one for my girlfriend as well.
"
"
I didn’t like the fact that the toothpaste feels more liquidlyBut loved the brush size, the power, it cleans great better than a regular or conventional toothbrush, easy to use
"
"
Took the enamel​ off my teeth and batteries didn't work. Somehow my teeth have MORE plaque since I've been using this. Probably because I no longer have enamel left. They also look almost transparent now.
"
"
Bought these for the kids. Can replace both batteries and the brush head. Very impressed. Light enough the 7 year old has no problem with it.
"
"
Great product for travel. A little under powered compared to the same plug in unit I use at home.Great for travel though and so far no issues.
"
"
I love this toothbrush!  I would never use another spin brush again.  This brush has lots of power and cleans to perfection
"
"
good value for price (using for travel so don't need recharger
"
"
wouldn't recommend for everyday use - should buy one of the higher-end models, but for travelling, it's perfect.
"
"
just what I wanted.
"
"
I've had mine for years only problem is that black mold tends to build up
"
"
Works well, arrived on time and is on par with the usual Oral-B quality.
"
"
It is what I need.
"
"
Works perfectly!
"
"
My teeth have never felt better. I didn't realize it when I ordered it, but it has a built-in timer. Once the time is up the brush pulses three times. Kind of handy, especially when you might be rushing. So far it's been great on the brand-name batteries that it came with.
"
"
At around $15 this toothbrush works great. No idea who buys these $200 electric toothbrushes (Bluetooth on a toothbrush - really?!) but this one does the job just as good as it uses the exact same brush heads as the more expensive models.Extra benefit, it runs on removable AA batteries so I don't have to worry about some build in battery die on me, effectively making the entire toothbrush worthless. I simply use rechargable AA batteries which means I can swap them whenever I need and have no charger taking up precious sink counter space.Great value for the money (and yes it cleans well)
"
"
This is exactly what you would buy in a drug store or big name store for half the price.Prices ranged from $23 on sale to $37 full retail.  Exactly the same product not a knockoff.Plus it came with batteries so you can use it right away no hunting to see if you have 2 batteries.At $15 money well spent.I suggest getting the replacement heads for an additional $15.  They come in a 12 pack so even if you like to replace the heads every month you're good to go for a year.Cheaper than buying manual  toothbrushes and better for your oral health.
"
"
Excellent grip. The nice rubber grip is a big enough selling feature on its own. No matter how wet my hands are the power switch is so easy to turn on and off. Compared to my old spinbrush this unit has so much more power. I'm starting to get use to the smaller head but if i couldn't its nice to know I can switch to a longer type head. At the purchase price of under 13 bucks I have to give this brush big thumbs up.
"
"
Love the timer, and that I can get to those hard to reach places. Batteries are useful since I travel overseas a lot and cannot use a rechargeable one.  Just wish the replacement heads were more readily available at stores, or atleast interchangable with the heads for the rechargeable toothbrushes.
"
"
Much cheaper than a $200 electric toothbrush that clutters up the counter with its charger. It works very well, is easy to handle and I am therefore very satisfied with my purchase.Advantages: you can easily get different brush heads in pharmacies or online. I personally have a few sensitive teeth so brushing with this brush was a little inconvenient at first. I bought a head for sensitive teeth and that's it! Also, 3 small shakes that tells you the recommended brushing time.Disadvantage: works with 2 AA batteries. You should therefore plan to change the batteries from time to time or use rechargeable batteries. That said, the batteries work for a long time (rechargeable for my part) and as mentioned above, it avoids having to have a charger on the bathroom counter.*UPDATE : after 1 year and a half of use -> it still works very well!Overall rating : 4Scores awarded in each category :• For travelling (5)• Value for money (4.5)• Battery life (4)----------------- Français -----------------Bien meilleur marché qu'une brosse à dents électrique à 200$ qui encombre le comptoir avec son chargeur.

We bought these toothbrushes on a road trip and also because we wanted to get a sense of how different it might be to use an electric toothbrush.  They worked well enough that we now have more upscale toothbrushes at home.  I can't say I'm a fan of the round brush head, even tho' they get great review.  Somehow, they don't seem to get things as clean as the traditional shape.  These are just fine for traveling though, except for a couple of minor things. If weight is an issue, they are a bit heavy as they have batteries. Also, they aren't the quietest gadgets going & we stayed in some B&B's where I wondered if the noise was bothering someone still sleeping in the next room! ;)... however, I was assured by the other guests that it wasn't a problem!
"

Better than the Oral-B Battery Power toothbrush in my opinion -- it cleans better and the head isn't big so it's easier to clean at the back of the molars. I prefer AA battery toothbrushes because rechargeable AA batteries are cheaper long term and I can replace them without having to charge the toothbrush -- just pop it in and you're ready to go. I've have built-in battery ones but once they die out, they're hard to replace.
"
"
I dont know what I was waiting for.  This is great.  I dont know how long battery will last but it cleans well and I am very happy with it.  I like that it is battery operated so easy to carry with you when traveling.  I wish it came with a cover but I'm satisfied with it.
"
"
I like the fact it runs on batteries. I do not have to carry the chargerand somehow find an outlet to use. If it runs down, replace the batteriesand you back in business right away.
"
"
I definitely like this purchase! Much better than a manual for sure. Think the only downside is the use of batteries but new that when purchased item.  Might need to invest in some rechargeables. The 2-minute timer is great. Great purchase!

I purchased this Oral B a little while ago, I remember buying one about a decade ago and paying so much for it, it was also one that had to be ""recharged""  so always had to remember to put it on charge. I couldn't take it for traveling and the charge didn't last that long.When I saw this one here, and the fact that it had just simple, regular batteries I thought I would try it.Well it turns out the be so much better that the ""rechargeable"" one that I had before.At least I can take it with me when I travel, I just have to make sure I have good batteries for it.It also cleans my teeth just as well as the other one.I would highly recommend it.
"
"
Bought this for use while travelling.  it's good for that purpose but it's not very powerful - even with new batteries - and therefore would not recommend it for regular use at home.  The rechargeable version of the same toothbrush is better for daily use.  This is fine though for what we bought it for.
"
"
I am many weeks in and still have not replaced the batteries!  The toothbrush really cleans my teeth well ! I do not use my tarter remover at all anymore as I do not have tarter buildup anymore with this toothbrush.  Because it does scrub hard, I only use before bed to protect my gums. I use a normal tooth brush in the morning.  I have not replaced the head yet so I cannot say how easy it is.
"
"
Edit: my first purchase was above my expectations, so I reordered . But the new brush just died after 2 days, maybe I got a lemon . I will update this review.OriginalAmazing product! Its movement is not too vigorous as my previous brush and the bristles are very comfortable. Easy to handle with changeable batteries. Affordable and good quality product.However its a little too powerful to what I prefer. Cleans well though
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I had one a long time ago, and recently decided to get it again. It literally gives you a full mouth clean. I feel like it cleans my teeth with ease.Would never go back to a regular toothbrush again.Plus, you can buy replacement heads for it, so you don’t have to toss it after this one wears out.
"
"
Nice toothbrush, fraction of the cost of other expensive electric toothbrushes and works well. Are these suppose to have water inside the toothbrush head/stem after every use? I end up having to remove the head to take the water out on every use which would have been more convenient if it didn't get stuck inside. Other then that, could have been a 5 star.
"
"
I purchased the Oral B Pro Health Dual Clean Power August 17, 2018 and a few days ago it turned on by itself and I could not turn it off using the button.  I had to take out the batteries for it to stop.  I also noticed that the cap at the bottom had a crack in it.  I hadn't noticed this before so perhaps both problems are related (happened at same time).  I am usually a pretty observant person so I think I would have noticed the crack if it happened before.Also, from the beginning I found it very hard to take off the cap at bottom (to change batteries) and put it back on.  I would not suggest purchasing this product for this issue alone and especially if you have weak hands.I bought ""standard"" Oral B replacement brushes from Costco.  I found they were not as good as the brush I got with the original purchase.  This was another disappointment and lead me to wonder ""why"" P&G would sub par replacement brushes.  I would expect the exact same experience with replacements as with the original.For all these reasons I would NOT buy this product again and would not recommend it to others.  I have written P&G to ask for a refund or replacement.  I believe the warranty is 2 years.  We'll see how that goes...Follow-up: I contacted company with my complaints and they gave me a full refund.  Client representative was very nice and only needed to see my amazon electronic receipt.  I bought another Oral B (Vitality Floss Action) so am hoping this one will be better.
"
"
If you have rechargeable batteries this tooth brush is the best option for the money and should last you 4-6 weeks before changing your batteries. The Oral-B with build in rechargeable batteries will only last 5-7 days in comparison for way more expensive. Works very well and clean you teeth very well.
"
"
I bought this as a replacement for an plug in electric toothbrush I have had for many years that finally stopped working properly.  I really like this battery one.  It works very well.  It is fairly lightweight and a great size for travelling.  It is a great buy.
"
"
This was my very first electric tooth brush. It works great and I can never go back to the regular tooth brush.The only downside is the noise. And also I don't like that it has a timer that tells you after 2 mins, but this might be rather useful for some people.
"
"
I had this exact model toothbrush for many years now. Usually last at least two years (of course your have to change the batteries and the headbrush regularly). I definitely recommend it. It's way cheaper than the one with internal rechargeable batteries and it does the exact same job.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush having some doubts because I had tried the “cheap” electric toothbrushes in the past and they where just ok. This toothbrush is amazing for the price you pay. I’ve only been using it a little over a week so can’t comment on battery life or longevity. I did notice a slight rattle develop after about 5 days that comes and goes but doesn’t seem to change the way it works. I’m ordering one for my husband now because he is jealous.
"
"
This toothbrush is definately superior to the brands I have purchased and the cost is more than reasonable.  This product exceeded my expectations. Continue to use a good quality battery and you will not be disappointed.
"
"
I've had the rechargeable ones for years but at this point I believe I prefer this one. Also the blister pack makes a wall hanger for the brush beside the sink. Remove the plastic blister and stick the very top tab to the wall with a little Goop.
"
"
As a cheap electric toothbrush I decided to give a try, never used before, this is not just cheap, but does the job very well, the external battery is basically to avoid the 1 year dead internal battery that others will give to you, also compatible with those packs of generic brush heads!
"
"
I've been using this model since 4 years ago. We currently have three at home, one for me, one for my wife, and one for my dog. It costs so little compared to fancy ones, so when it becomes moldy, I can simply throw it away and buy a new one. I don't buy the concept of expensive ones, because none of them would replace daily flossing.
"
"
I really like this toothbrush.  My teeth feel much cleaner and I like the 2 minute timer as I never go that long if I brush manually.  Considering you get 2 batteries plus 2 brush heads I think this is a great deal.
"
"
Really enjoyed this so far, my dentist recommended that I switch over to an electronic toothbrush and after a few days i defintaly noticed a difference on the back and top gums of my teeth. Significantly whiter
"
"
So far this has been a great product and you can't beat this price! I love my electric toothbrush and the battery powered I find is better for storage then the electric. No chords cluttering up your bathroom space! My teeth always feel extremely clean after brushing and thus far the battery has worked great. I only gave it four stars for travelling as it's a little bit bulkier, but that's to be expected.
"
"
Have always been a fan of electric toothbrushes.  This one doesn't disappoint. Great travel or overnight toothbrush. You don't have to worry about plugging it in. I would definitely buy this again.
"
"
Battery last well with this brush. A lot cheaper than buying at grocery store and/or pharmacies. If you. An try to replace head about every 3-6 months. Still works well after this point, but would recommend changing brush head when bristles start to significantly fade.
"
"
This is a great travel item!  Also great for home use.  I bought mine for travel as it is too hard to take the electric toothbrush on vacation. I would recommend it to anyone who cares about their teeth.
"
"
So I've only had it for almost 3 months and it has already stopped working. I've tried changing the batteries but it still doesnt work. Not impressed. Won't buy again.
"
"
Bought this a few months ago and could never go back to a regular toothbrush! Super easy to use, pretty decent battery life (only changed once, after 3 months of consistent use). It’s a little loud but not bothersome. Also the cheapest on amazon! Definitely recommend.
"
"
The head randomly stops spinning while im using it. Trying to change the battery but it's a huge struggle to get the bottom cap off. So annoying. Gonna have to switch back to a manual toothbrush or one that charges rather than uses batteries
"
"
We bought two brushes. I initially enjoyed the level of clean, however my motor died within the first two months. My husband's died after he changed the batteries and the  battery door broke. Certainly not worth $15 each.
"
"
Received this product and it looked great but simply doesn't work. Tried 8 different batteries and none will give it any power. Very disappointing.
"
"
 First one had a broken head after a month. Now the second one makes weirds stops and is unusable. Don’t waste your time on those cheap ones.
"
"
Love this toothbrush. Need something with power but that wouldn’t break the bank. Noticed a difference after the first brush. Would definitely recommend!
"
"
Switched over from a rectangular tooth brush head and I love the small circle so much more. I feel like I actually get every tooth this way and it has a timer so you know when you've brushed for an adequate amount.
"
"
Great for travel we loved the replacement feature and ordered our second pair for hubby as well . Does the job replacement is not very expensive .
"
"
When I got the toothbrush I didn’t realize it was battery only. I must have missed this in the description because I had thought it was rechargeable.I would give 5star if it said this in the title to make it clear.
"
"
Great value for money and comes with a long lasting battery - I've had expensive electric toothbrushes before and they are a waste of money - this one does exactly what you need it to do - also having it has encouraged me to use it more frequently throughout the day
"
"
Worst toothbrush ever. How do I contact the seller. Very clunky and seemed very sluggish even after changing the batteries
"
"
C'est la 4e que j'achète et elles finissent toutes par ne plus fonctionner après 1 mois ou 2. Même quand  les piles sont changées. Le mécanisme ne fonctionne plus 😤
"
"
I didn’t realize when buying the batteries included were not rechargeable.  The battery compartment is more difficult to open than I hoped.  Also, batteries and battery charger needed to be bought separately to keep it going.
"
"
Love this power clean toothbrush. I just wish it had a timer, I tend to keep brushing as it does  such a great job!
"
"
Worth it for the price, haven’t travelled with it yet but I’m sure they’ll be fine. Bought them for my kids, you can change the brush head so it’ll last longer then most power brushes for kids.
"
"
Tried to change the battery after changing the brush head, it doesn’t close now and since I’m travelling in Asia I can’t find it anywhere at affordable prices here, I’m so mad I’m using the hotel’s cheap plastic brushes to go by
"
"
I purchased two of these: one for my son and one for myself. We were both quite pleased, but both died in under 2 months - just days apart. We replaced batteries and did trouble-shooting, but there was no saving them. :(
"
"
Have been using this brush for over two weeks and so far the power has not diminished. Cleans teeth as advertised. Satisfied with this purchase so far.
"
"
It would only better if it had a 30 second pulse option, so you could clean each section of your mouth for equal time... but it's a great product, especially for the price! I'll be interested to see the difference/if any at next dental cleaning appointment.
"
"
Good quality, small brush works better than regular size brush. Bottom part a bit bigger and heavier, as there are 2 batteries.Can’t comment battery yet, just used for few days, so far so good.
"
"
Gros pour voyager cependant pour la maison excellente brosse à dents
"
"
Fait un aussi bon travail qu'une brosse électrique mais sans fil.
"
"
Had this toothbrush for 1 month. About 3 weeks in, the head was stopping with the slightest pressure. It made brushing my teeth very time consuming. Tried to return the item but found out I was 2 days too late. Do not purchase!
"
"
Bought this toothbrush off Amazon in September now the toothbrush doesn't work that was only 5 months would never buy this product again
"
"
Excellent, my teeth feel great after brushing. I use good rechargeable batteries ( Duracell ) so no worries of the toothbrush going bad because of cheap rechargeable batteries in the unit from factory that you can't replace.
"
"
This thing works great. Just as good as what you'd pay $100+ for. Biggest downside is having to change batteries vs recharge. But, to me, that's not a big deal.

Rechargeable version is good and available, but for travel, nothing beats the battery operated version.
"
"
Runs on batteries, no accumulator and no charger. Better to buy something rechargable.
"
"
Nice toothbrush for the price.fast shipping no issues. Great that it includes batteries
"
"
my kids first mechanical toothbrushes... works great
"
"
Gets used really quick, in less than a month it became almost unusable and I need to change the brushing head...
"
"
The battery died at least once a month, and then it just slowly stopped working to the point where if it touch anything while spinning it would stop. Back to ye old manual brush now.
"
"
The actual brush itself is very smallNot even as big as one tooth
"
"
I ordered one it arrived and didn't work. I thought at first; it was the batteries, so changed them. Nothing, dead, useless junk. So, I ordered another one and the same thing, happened. It's garbage and a total rip off.
"
"
I was relaxing an old toothbrush that was loosing its power.  This new one had only about the old one being replaced.  Feels like you are brushing at half speed.  Would not buy again nor recommend
"
"
being battery powered was great for a travel toothbrush
"
"
A great electric brush. My husband bought one after seeing mine and was very happy.
"
"
Brosse à dent avec un moteur peu performant. Il ne tourne vraiment pas assez vite. J’ai essayé d’autres piles et la lenteur est toujours là. Très déçue.
"
"
Got this for my husband. He said it feels more powerful than the other brands of that price range. He likes it.
"
"
I love these - no need to recharge and no cords.  Battery operated and it comes with batteries that ladt a long time!
"
"
I wouldn’t recommend buying this product. After 4 months of using it, it stopped working. I’ve changed the batteries but it’s no longer functioning and I will now need to buy another toothbrush.
"
"
Good price my child will be taking it to school
"
"
Poor quality. The on-off switch failed. The tooth brush starts on its own and does not stop until the batteries die. This is the second tooth brush I buy from Amazon. They both failed in the same way.
"
"
Great brush at a great price.
"
"
Local prices are ridiculous & Amazon's price was a shock!! Great price, quick delivery & happy with this electric toothbrush.
"
"
wanted to try the round toothbrush and I think I like it... very good price helps
"
"
I got it, I tried it, I'm happy with it but not really strong.
"
"
J'adore cette brosse à dents.  Nettoie bien les dents et détache les residus alimentaires entre les dents.
"
"
Bought this item twice. Both stopped working after 3 months. Apparently, they are designed to just get over the return period.
"
"
does a good job for cleaning my gum line
"
"
Cleans your teeth really well, will definitely buy it again
"
"
It's good. Battery isn't dead yet and very good to clean my teeth. Only problem is that the bristles wear out quickly
"
"
When I changed battery for the first time, the bottom cap could not be closed because the rubber ring inside gave a strong resistance. I had to use force to close it and the cap broke. This should be a design problem.
"
"
Very good value.
"
"
Mes dents n'ont jamais été aussi propres.
"
"
bon brosse a dent
"
"
My wife is very happy with it. Cleans better than manual tooth brush. Make sure you turn it on after you put in in your mouth. Otherwise toothpaste will be all over the place.
"
"
It's working just fine
"
"
Works okay though not as well as the older version I had (but couldn't find replacement heads for) with the double top head.
"
"
It works well.  Have a plug in electric toothbrush, but got this for traveling.  And works much better than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Works fine.
"
"
Very good, does the job right
"
"
Nice brush worth the price
"
"
Very easy to use and my teeth are super clean
"
"
Makes a lot of noise and vibrating, but I don't find it does much in terms of cleaning. Very disappointed that the brushes don't spin. I'm going back to a regular toothbrush. I don't think electric ones are for me.
"
"
works as expected although it took some getting accustomed to the small head. comparable price as in the store.
"
"
It’s for my godchild she seems to like it
"
"
This product works well however I found the brushes a little stiff! Price was excellent!
"
"
Works great. Happy with it. The round toothbrush cleans well. Would recommend.
"
"
Great product
"
"
love this powerful toothbrush, hope it last me a long time.
"
"
not gud i used just 5 days now not working runing stuck and run stop run stop
"
"
Going into the second year with no problems.
"
"
3 min of brushing, great product. I prefer the battery powered one as the last two rechargable units have failed in 8 months due to the battery.
"
"
I did not realize this was a battery operated product but am very happy to use this when I travel.
"
"
Works well, kids love the quite sound and fast turning brush, should have included additional brush head.
"
"
Super
"
"
not as powerful as i like it. Seems underpowered compared to my oral B braun with lithium Ion

I love this toothbrush. I’m on my second one now. I even bought one for my boyfriend.
"
"
Good toothbrush, baterry life is correct
"
"
Cleans my teeth.  Battery lasts a long time.  Scares the cat.
"
"
Runs on  2 AA batteries but does not seem very powerful.But it does hold a charge for a long timeWould not buy again
"
"
Powerful and effective toothbrush that does a good job of cleaning. Batteries (2x AA) generally lasts 2.5 to 3 weeks on average before needing to be changed. Removing and attaching the battery cover does require some physical strength as it's not as easy to attach/re-attach unless you apply force.
"
"
Loved this!
"
"
Came on time, and was as pictured.
"
"
Worked fine for 10 months then it stopped working. Maybe should just use disposable ones instead of this or just buy a good electric one?
"
"
My son an I like the tooth brush
"
"
never thought I can have a great electric brush for 15$! thanks!
"
"
It does a very good job, it reaches easily every teeth even behind the last ones and it does a strong vibration so the cleaning is excellent.
"
"
Très bon produit, J'aime bien je le recommande.
"
"
Very good, light and easy to get replacement heads.
"
"
Converted it into a makeshift pick, works incredible!

Battery cover doesn't stay on. Spring pressure from batteries makes cover fly off. Returned.

I got this toothbrush for traveling--I own a similar rechargeable Oral-B for home use. To my surprise this battery-operated toothbrush is much quieter than other electronic toothbrushes I own. It also takes the same replacement brush-head as my rechargeable, which is brilliant!As for the brush of the toothbrush, I am a petite woman and have a small mouth. The rounded brushing head is more suitable for me than the more generally available rectangular head. I am more easily able to reach my back teeth and behind my teeth.As for the brush-heads themselves, if purchased from Oral-B they are expensive, but the popularity of this style of toothbrush has resulted in much cheaper generic heads for sale as well.The only negative is that if you are worried about weight or space, this toothbrush takes two AA batteries, whereas some battery-operated toothbrushes take one. It is, therefore, heavier and larger than some other brands.
"
"
I am very impressed with this toothbrush. I was looking for an electric toothbrush without the clunky base that most models feature; this item fits the bill perfectly. It is just as powerful as the models that cost upwards of $100. I've been using it for 3-4 minutes, twice a day and the Duracell​ batteries I used lasted about 5 weeks.
"
"
Works so well, omg.  My previous one was one that had a base and you always had to have that plugged in and put the toothbrush on it.  It's just so much stuff for an electric toothbrush.  This one though, just pop a battery in there and you're good to go.  For the price, you're getting a FANTASTIC product.  I couldn't be happier.
"
"
Just tried it. Love that it has the 2 minute timer.. you can brush for longer afterwards (it doesn't shut off) but it'll buzz when 2 minutes is up. Like another poster said, definitely would have been nice to have a 30second buzz too. I was debating between the battery powered and rechargeable for a long time, but I think the two factors that made me want to get battery instead is that I can always buy new batteries whereas once the rechargeable stops holding a charge I'll have to get a whole new toothbrush and the fear of the rechargeable falling everywhere due to the cords etc. (eww toothbrush & bathroom floor... I'd be changing brushes every week at the rate of my clumsiness).
"
"
this worked fine for about a year. Bought it oct 16/16 and as of yesterday, it will no longer work, even with new batteries. i had to change the batteries 3 times during the year that i had it.  I used it twice a day for the year. Would only recommend if a travel brush is needed.i am ordering a new brush with a rechargeable stand. hope it lasts longer. and at least i won't have to muck about changing batteries all the time. hopefully.
"
"
Not even close to the power of the higher end cordless, rechargable models that costs 6 X as much. I was not expecting the same power as the high end models but I am still very unimpressed with this model, just feels weak when using it.
"
"
I purchased this toothbrush Jan 2016. I changed the batteries and changed the toothbrush head, but it no longer works. Has anyone else has this problem?
"
"
Perfect electric toothbrush to travel with when you are used of electric toothbrush and don't feel like going back to the handheld manual archaic toothbrush
"
"
I have only had it for a few days but so far I really like it! Great value
"
"
I use this for travel, works well, I wish it had a travel case.
"
"
cheap very very, the head is good
"
"
after one use my mouth feels so much cleaner compared to when i used just a standard toothbrush. such a good feeling 10/10
"
"
Very disappointed!  I had an Oral-B Power Toothbrush that lasted for years and years before having to be replaced.  This one, however, didn't last a few days.  It stops as soon as it touches a tooth, yet all connections appear to work correctly.  Ugh!!!!
"
"
It didn't last even 6 months and the local Oral B warranty company didn't even want to take a look to see if they could fix it as this model is not manufactured in Brazil. So what? It could be something simple to fix, but I'll never know, right?!
"
"
Ambrose (reviewer above) is right, I've got half a dozen of the Oral-B sonicare range sitting on the shelf below the sink to prove it--they no longer hold a proper charge--maybe I'll get around to removing their batteries for proper recycling, but until then, you can't even discard them in the trash.About a year ago, I searched for a model with replaceable batteries and found this. I use high capacity AA rechargeable batteries (from amazon)--and overall it is much easier on the wallet, better for the environment, and makes for a cleaner look on the bathroom counter.I took one star off for the design on the battery compartment/cap seal--there's room for improvement there, and if an Oral-B engineer is reading this, it's going to be the failure point--I can tell.
"
"
this is the prefect buy so far, and a better deal than most of buy on the market. in the earlier years, my first electric toothbrush was Oral-B rechargeable brush. it was great and worked flawlessly until its rechargeable battery died three years later. I took it apart and found out the battery was Ni-Cd which usually lasts about three years and almost non-replaceable, because the whole socket and housing holding the battery is soldered and tied down to the every possible joints. therefore, I understand that the philosophy of Oral-B is to keep us to buy their bush every three years. my second brush was a higher grade one, Philip super-sonic brush, which was great and very powerful in term of vibration frequency and cleaning ability. I like it very much and enjoy it very moment I use it. however, the time comes and it died in about four years since the battery can't be charged any more. I took it apart and found out the same thing-- A non-replaceable Ni-Cd battery was installed. everything else just worked fine. my third one was a third-party non-brand super sonic toothbrush, which is in a good price but last only six month. then, I decided to try battery powered brush, which is this guy-- two AA powered Oral-B brush--and it works just as great as the previous one according to my dentist when examing my teeth. when it is needed, just replace the AA battery, that's it. never ever to buy a new brush. so people understand the marketing and philosophy behind the rechargeable toothbrush, buy this one to save your money. by the way, I use rechargeable Ni-Cd AA battery to power my brush. two 2500 mA rechargeable batteries can last about two-three month.
"
"
I bought this product for my girlfriend because I thought it would be nice for her to have her own toothbrush when at my place and it worked more-or-less who it should have for the first bit. The battery life was pretty low and over 6 months we had to replace the batteries 3 times - but on the 3rd time, it started turning on in the middle of the night completely on its own and it woke us up out of a dead sleep and into a panic because we are the only two in the home. I guess you get what you pay for, but I hate just wasting plastic and products simply because they are built so cheaply.
"
"
Stopped working after 2 months despite changing the battery. I purchased 2 of these, one is working perfectly fine and the other turns on for 2 seconds then stops and Aftwr you turn it off you can use it for another 2 seconds once you turn it back on again. Useless. Want to return

For about 15 years, I was using an Oral-B ""Professional"" 3D Excel toothbrush. But as the years went on, the charge wouldn't last past one cleaning.  I was disappointed.I got this  Oral-B Pro-Health Dual Clean Power Toothbrush  when it was $15. I'm very happy with my decision. I wish I didn't buy that pricey rechargeable 3D Excel.What I love about this Pro_health toothbrush:(A) It's powered by regular AA batteries, which means:  1) You don't need AC power. You can pack 30 rechargeable AAs with you when you're camping for a month. You'll have body odor, but your breath will be fresh.  2) You'll never have to throw away your handle due to its internal battery not holding a charge. With AAs, you can always have energy.(B) It's so much cheaper than a rechargeable Oral-B. Fifteen bucks only! The price is so good I'm considering buying another one for my car. With another brush, I no longer have to take my bathroom's brush for when I need to brush in the car. :)
"
"
purchased for the kids, awesome toothbrushes, love the AA requirment, will be replacing my rechargable with this simply due to the fact that batteries last at least a month where the rechargable oral b needs charging at least once a week. cleans as good as my rechargable costing $75.
"
"
I've had these for my three kids for about 5 months. They work great and heads are replaceable at Costco. However, one of the toothbrushes is useable but broken--  for some reason the battery compartment wouldn't seal after changing the batteries a while back. No issues with the other two brushes, but the base of this one ended up cracking. We taped it up with electrical tape since its past the return window, and so far so good. Disappointing, but I would still buy again.
"
"
I found the same item on grocery stores cheaper than here. The rest is ok. Happy with its functionality. Great for travelling and battery is A4 easy to find and replace. Colors not unique.
"
"
Not quite as powerful as the rechargeable ones. But for the money is perfect.I’ve been using it every day for the last 5 months and it’s great, uses the same heads as the rechargeable brushes. Battery’s lasts a few weeks before It gets weak.Using aa batteries is actually a pro for me, no charger. You just put new batteries in when it’s dead
"
"
The older model when it was still made by ranir was better. This model spins slower, even with 1.6V nizn batteries it still spins slower than the old version which I have. They cheapened on the new model.
"
"
Works as it should but the battery life is atrocious. This thing will drain AA like its nothing. Consider a rechargeable AA battery for this.
"
"
I bought two for my kids. when it is working, my kids love them. However, after only 4 month normal usage, the switch on one of them is not function. you just can't turn it off, very disappointed.
"
"
Amazing feeling. Like visiting your dentist for cleaning twice a day :)
"
"
Very fast delivery and pleases with the items. Powerfull toothbrush, did not try the brush yet (reason for 4 stars) but i've purchased 2 others!!

Definitely cleans a lot better than a regular toothbrush.

Ironically, this item was completely different from what I thought I was ordering, and I couldn't be happier with a happy accident. Some fifteen years ago, I was given an Oral B power brush as a gift. It gave me many great years of service and owed me nothing when it finally packed it in. Hoping to replicate the experience, I ordered this item on Amazon, expecting a power toothbrush with a corded stand/charger. Turns out it's actually powered by a pair of AA batteries, eliminating the cumbersome cord running across the back of the sink, and has every bit of the power of my old one. Uses the same round head as my old one, which enables me to use my stockpile of replacement heads.Highly recommend this little rig, so much I even bought a second one for the RV.
"
"
Shhhhhh, don't let out the secret. This is the best toothbrush ever! Go ahead and search for the ""best electric toothbrush"". You'll find tons of articles pitting the entire Oral-B and Sonicare ranges against each other. This one never wins. The thing is - they are all extremely close. All of the product offerings significantly outperform a manual brush and they are all extremely close to each other in terms of plaque removal. It's really down to user technique more-so than the brush.Why is this the best?First - It costs less than 1/10th of some of it's big brothers.Second - It uses standard Oral-B heads.Third - AA batteries. Best feature ever!I had one of the Oral-B ProCare rechargeable brushes and it's a more powerful brush with more cowbell (3D action, pressure sense, etc, etc). It lasted a few years before the batteries wouldn't hold a charge for more than a day. The big problem? You can't change the batteries (well you can... you have to solder out the old battery and get a special size from an electronics store). For the average person, those fancy rechargeables will need to be replaced every 3 years or so. With this one, you can just switch the batteries. As a bonus, you don't need to worry about the charge base and wires on your bathroom counter.While it doesn't have the power and features of the higher-end products, my teeth don't seem to notice, neither does my dentist.
"
"
For the price, this toothbrush is great. It's battery-powered motor and rotating bristles allow for seamless teeth-cleaning, especially in hard to reach places that typically don't get enough attention from a manual toothbrush. Also, the timer is a really nice feature to remind you when you've done the job sufficiently.My only real irk about it is the fact that is really quite noisy. It can make the teeth-brushing experience a little off-putting and more annoying than it needs to be.If you're alright with a little noise as you brush away at your chompers, then for the price and quality, it's a great option.
"
"
Love this toothbrush.  I had a lot of problem with brushing my teeth, gagging and heaving (I have a very small mouth).  This has cured my problems.  With the small, rounded brush, I can work on one tooth at a time, and even get the back ones without feeling my mouth is too full of toothpaste and brush.  Has a one minute timer on it that pulses 3 times, reminding you to move on to the lower teeth after doing the top for 60 seconds.  Just takes a tiny bit of toothpaste, so saves on that too.  This has been a great purchase for me.  Loved it so much I bought one for my husband too!

Most of the powered toothbrushes on the market are rechargeable which seems to be a more environmentally responsible choice but the problem is that once the life cycle of the battery is done so is the whole unit. More junk. These toothbrushes use AA batteries which can be purchased in a rechargeable form. You simply swap out the batteries. If traveling you have the option of preparing extra batteries or buying AAs. They use the same Oral B heads and work for a long time before replacing the batteries. And the price is amazing low

Bought this toothbrush for my autistic son.  Using a manual toothbrush, my son refuse to brush near his gum line, thus causing bleeding gum issues. Constantly fighting the manual toothbrush vs his mouth.  Using this toothbrush, my son doesn't have to move the  toothbrush back and forth, instead just hold the toothbrush in one spot and slowly move it to another. The key thing here is that my son can brush his own teeth instead of me brushing it for him.  Results is quite noticeable, I can see the difference around my son's gum lines.  Wished I purchased this sooner.

I owned one I used daily for 3 years before the contacts at the bottom got corroded and I had to replace the brush. I used rechargeable batteries. I think I got my money's worth on it so I decided to buy again. It's worth drying the stem after use so the water doesn't run down all the time. The O-ring that protects the batteries works, but it will get dirty in there, which is normal in those conditions. I think with better care my other one would've lasted longer.

I recently purchased this to replace an older brush and I just love it. Feels solid in your hand, and I like the small round head, you can really feel it getting into all the little spaces. I'm pleased with the two-minute timer feature, it pulses a few times when you have been brushing for two minutes so you know you've brushed long enough. Surprisingly I can find no mention of that feature on the packaging or online, however the brush I received does have it. Pleasantly surprised.
"
"
Great for travel overseas, do not have to carry your 120 volt charger and plug adaptors or transformers to convertto european current.The 2 AA batteries lasted me 3+ weeks for twice daily use,YMMV.I'm very happy with my purchase.
"
"
My previous one with the old design lasted a decade and still working but I replaced it due to the deteriorated rubber grip. This one with the newer design lasted a year and refused to spin normally. It is a very common problem if you check the reviews. I stripped it down and cleaned the rubber seal on the metal shaft and it works again, but for how long? This is exactly why our environments will only get worse because companies put profits above all else and we end up producing massive amount of waste and pollution unnecessarily.
"
"
I usually buy the corded version but got this by mistake.  I actually prefer the battery operated version because I don't have to deal with the charging base being plugged in.  The brush vibrates nice and smooth and seems faster than my corded version.  Update....After using it for a few months I found the batteries needed replacing after 2 months with using it once a day.
"
"
Le manufacturier devrait enlever la batterie qui ne dure pas du tout et remplacez ceci par des batteries rechargeables et c’est parfait! La machine s’arrête au bout de deux minutes exactement ce qui est très pratique car on sait toujours qu’il faut se brosser les dents pour deux minutes!
"
"
For the price this is an awesome electric toothbrush. You can really feel the difference on your teeth after you brush, my teeth feel so much cleaner than using a normal toothbrush. And it isn't too large. Would be easy to take traveling.
"
"
Les brosses à dent plus haut de gamme sont munies de piles rechargeable internes. Lorsque ces piles deviennet défectueuses, le remplacement est très complexe rendant la brosse inopérable.Quant à celle-ci, lorsque la pile devient faible, nous n'avons qu'à la changer !
"
"
For the price there really isn’t much to expect. It gets the job done but nothing special about it. It is not as strong as my 8 year old rechargeable Oral-B brush (which I had to replace since the battery died) but not too bad.Overall I’m ok with the purchase.
"
"
I also ordered this in error. I wanted a corded. It's one of those good mistakes lol. This does a much better job than the corded one ever did. I like the fact that it has no cord and no base. My teeth feel clean. I just received the product so not too sure how much battery life you get. but so far, I'm a happy customer.
"
"
These toothbrushes are excellent and worth the price. I have the plug in version. I purchased two for my young kids. My daughter said after using, that her teeth felt as clean as leaving the dentist after a cleaning. Worth buying!
"
"
Great travel toothbrush.  Standard Oral-B brushes fit.  Lots of power.  I can't comment on battery life as I haven't had the unit long enough...but heading to  England soon for a 3-week stay so I'll update later.
"
"
I’ve purchased this tooth brush 3 times and for some reason amazon batteries and energizer batteries don’t fit properly. I broke the battery cover each time. So frustrating
"
"
Keeps plaque build up to a minimum.  Far superior to manual brushing.Battery life is good: uses 2 AA batteries and from what I recall they last a few months. Depending on the user, heads should last between 3-6 months. Especially important to clean the heads thoroughly when used with kids toothpaste, which will rot inside.
"
"
Decent quality, if you don't mind there is only one brush head in there, and you have to pay for a second one after it.
"
"
The tooth brush worked for a three week then stoped working all to together on the fourth week. I even changed the battery because I though that was the issue didn’t help none will not be buying this again.
"
"
I ordered this for my husband as he said that his current Oral B that he's had for 10 years sounded like the motor was going.  He said that this one works so well that he loves it!  I am going to order one for myself!
"
"
This replaces the same unit I had for 2 years. I like it enough to buy a a second one. Battery life could be better, but maybe it’s the cheap Amazon batteries in using.
"
"
Worked for about a month of two, and it was great while it worked, but then it started stalling every couple seconds. Tried new batteries and a new brush head, but it made no difference.
"
"
My teeth have never been cleaner. Why spend more money for similar results? Yes I have to replace the battery but like... oh well. This does the job for a fraction of the price. I bought the twelve pack of brush heads too. What a steal.
"
"
I ordered this by mistake I thought I was getting a rechargble one with our the charger.  This would have been fine as I have two chargers but the old tooth brush battery is dyingI was going to return it but took it on a two week trip to Mexico and it was good for travel.  Ivan
"
"
This Toothbrush is excellent !!  It’s been really strong and I can feel the bristles going through my teeth for a extremely good clean . Love love love!  Excellent deal and love the fact that you can buy new heads when you need them .
"
"
Totally love the fact that it runs on AA batteries, cleans my teeth super well and has good battery life. I like how the head comes off easily so I can rinse and clean it well after use.
"
"
Great for travelling . No cord or charging base
"
"
Gets teeth feeling nice and clean, vibrates to signal 2 minute mark and good price. You can't go wrong.
"
"
purchased for granddaughter for Xmas. It was a great hit.  Her teeth are now being brushed without asking..& very often,
"
"
Very impressed with how well this toothbrush works, I was going to get one with a charger but I thought this was more practical, the battery lasts a long time! And the price is so cheap, it's such a steal,would buy it again
"
"
Basic battery powered toothbrush good for travel use. Interchangeable heads, easily replaced batteries.
"
"
Perfect for the price ! So glad I went with the replacement batteries. Just as great as the 80$ one but for a fraction of the price !
"
"
Seems to go through batteries a bit much but  does the job and many after market brush heads are available for it. Overall a good purchase
"
"
Great toothbrush but came with almost drained batteries. Replaced them and all was well.
"
"
This is not as powerfull as the rechargeable Toothbrush that I use at home, brush head fit both. it is great for travel with no wire and base unit.
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price. Cleans like the more expensive model. Very satisfied.
"
"
Using AA batteries for Oral-B power toothbrushes is the best way to go (instead of throwing the toothbrush away or trying to replace the internal battery).
"
"
Better than manual brush. Wish it was as powerful as the rechargeable Oral-B I use at home.
"
"
elle fonctionne très bien et bien moins cher qui dans nos magasin merci
"
"
This is an incredible toothbrush!! My teeth feel so slick and clean after brushing and the timer function is excellent!!
"
"
Wont work with 1.2V nimh batteries. Needs 1.5V. Disappointing.
"
"
Good value. The battery lasts long. This power brush provides the same functionality as the Oral B 1000 but without a rechargeable built in battery. It has a builtin 2 minute timer as well.
"
"
I bought 2 of these and both function as expected.  The timer works well.  Best of all is the price... it's cheaper than I can buy locally!
"
"
These are great toothbrushes. Bought 1 for when my husband had to go in hospital and obviously couldn't take his plug in one!  The power handle is just the right size and is great for travelling, and you can't beat the price. Love it.
"
"
Best electric toothbrush.  I don’t travel so couldn’t answer that rating.This is the second one I’ve purchased 😊I am very happy with this product
"
"
I loved that while traveling I didn’t need to plug in especially when voltage varies all over the world.
"
"
I've been using it only for 3 weeks.  It feels great after every washing .
"
"
Had to amend my rating. The toothbrush broke the second time I went to change my brush head. It's now garbage.
"
"
poor quality! not strong enough, batteries empty very fast!
"
"
A better clean, especially for arthritis sufferers
"
"
Oral-B pro-health power toothbrush is very handy for travel without the bulk. It is inexpensive and requires two AA batteries.It is faster than the Vitality, has a timer and make battery changing a breeze.
"
"
Not too bulky which is what I aimed for
"
"
parfait, mais ne se fait pas électrique
"
"
It works great, not much else to say about this
"
"
Good head for cleaning but even with two fresh, reputable brand batteries... The motor creates no brushing power/torque
"
"
Had one with a rechargeable battery that won't hold a charge after years of service.  Bought this as it uses AA batteries.  Cleans well.
"
"
As expected. Great toothbrush. A bit loud though lol. Would recommend.
"
"
Fait très bien le nettoyage et à bas prix
"
"
My kid likes it because it is not too strong like the other kind of rechargeable Oral-B (the kind thatcomes with a recharging device). This Pro-Health gives a consistent action: not too vigorous, butstrong enough for cleaning. It's also convenient since the battery can be replaced (about 2months).
"
"
Not a brush I' like too small of head and seems too powerful for my liking.
"
"
A good electronic toothbrush for travel, although I find the rotation of the brush a bit slower compared to an electric one but that is expected. For the price though, this is a good deal. Recommended.
"
"
Worked as expected
"
"
Good toothbrush.
"
"
product OK, bottom plastic battery cover cracked, hard to slide off
"
"
I hated it at first because I wasn't used to it, but now that I am, I will never go back to a manual brush!! My teeth feel way more clean using this power toothbrush.
"
"
Dont waste ur money
"
"
Works great!
"
"
As expected
"
"
It does the job
"
"
So much more convenient than a rechargeable unit;  battery lasts a long time. Especially good for travel.
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Nice toothbrush that runs on double AA’s.  Works well.
"
"
4th week with the brush: Still with batteries it came with. As this is my first electric toothbrush, I cannot say much, but for my use, fits very well. Only thing I would change is to have a rechargeable battery, but this would increase substancially the price.Overall, I'm loving it.
"
"
long battery life.

Bought this nearly a year ago, can't believe it still works perfectly, still delivers same brushing power with no apparent slow down. Not to mention I've only had to change the battery once!
"

Works good, delivery on time
"

Fonctionne très bien!

"
"
Battery worn out too fast.
"
"
I switch to battery because the rechargeable is expensive.  I also find battery version last longer than the rechargeable.
"

It's ok. Some replacement heads for oral b don't fit.

timer is the best part 2 min.

Not the dual clean model as the title says.

I've had this tooth brush for a few months now, and had left it at my family house for use when I would visit home (which is perhaps 1 or 2 weekends a month). I purchased this about February, so it's only been about 8 months of intermittent use. Battery life isn't the best, as I've had to swap batteries twice in that time with little use, and the battery cap design is very poor. It's quite difficult to remove, which is understandable given the need for a water tight seal, but the plastic itself is very fragile. After swapping out batteries for a second time this past weekend, the cap cracked when reattaching it.I was original quite pleased with this tooth brush, thinking that perhaps I had avoided some of the problems listed by other reviewers, but I was hoping for something that would hold up better.
"
"
Solid little toothbrush that can use rechargeable batteries, which end up easier and cheaper to replace than the whole toothbrush when built-in battery designs end up failing.If you found my review helpful, please select yes.
"
"
Don't waste your money here. Buy locally so you will have coverage for when this cheaply made toothbrush goes, and it will. I've only had it for 4 months and changed the batteries. Now the battery cap will not lock on. I have tried repeatedly and it just keeps popping off no matter what I do. Amazon offers no contact number for a return. I am discovering that a lot of Amazon items are simply garbage. Buyer beware, not only on this item but a lot of Amazon items. I'm pretty much done with ordering on Amazon, as I've had well too many bad experiences.
"
"
I prefer these ones that can use AA's than the built in batteries that require a charging stand!
"
"
Just as described.  Like that it's battery-powered as we're out of outlet space in the bathroom. :)
"
"
Nice little brush like being able to use my rechargeble ""AA"", others have posted over the battery cover being difficult to remove but if you push both sides off the brush then pull on the cover it comes off quite easily.
"
"
This is NOT the dual clean this is the precision clean oral b tooth brush
"
"
Much better than a regular toothbrush
"
"
I was disappointed that this was battery operated and not electric charging I did not see any where in the description that it was battery operated
"
"
Broken took it out of the box tried everything just didn't want to work. It was a paper weight so I threw it away!
"
"
Bon
"
"
A wise consumer won't find a better value than this tooth brush.Low cost, a two-minute timer, and the motor is powered by standard batteries. The replacement brushes are on the dear side, but my satisfaction with the product is high.The toothbrush cleans well. ""Manual"" toothbrushes don't do nearly as good a job.You could spend much more money on a product with a charger and a battery that you can't service.
"
"
For its price, it is very awesome product.Cleans my teeth and gum very well, also the motor is just strong enough to clean your teeth without hurting gum.Battery lasts quite long time as well.Great purchase, got another one for my girlfriend as well.
"
"
I didn’t like the fact that the toothpaste feels more liquidlyBut loved the brush size, the power, it cleans great better than a regular or conventional toothbrush, easy to use
"
"
Took the enamel​ off my teeth and batteries didn't work. Somehow my teeth have MORE plaque since I've been using this. Probably because I no longer have enamel left. They also look almost transparent now.
"
"
Bought these for the kids. Can replace both batteries and the brush head. Very impressed. Light enough the 7 year old has no problem with it.
"
"
Great product for travel. A little under powered compared to the same plug in unit I use at home.Great for travel though and so far no issues.
"
"
I love this toothbrush!  I would never use another spin brush again.  This brush has lots of power and cleans to perfection
"
"
good value for price (using for travel so don't need recharger
"
"
wouldn't recommend for everyday use - should buy one of the higher-end models, but for travelling, it's perfect.
"
"
just what I wanted.
"
"
I've had mine for years only problem is that black mold tends to build up
"
"
Works well, arrived on time and is on par with the usual Oral-B quality.
"
"
It is what I need.
"
"
Works perfectly!
"
"
My teeth have never felt better. I didn't realize it when I ordered it, but it has a built-in timer. Once the time is up the brush pulses three times. Kind of handy, especially when you might be rushing. So far it's been great on the brand-name batteries that it came with.
"
"
Teeth feel so much cleaner vs. regular brushing.  Takes a few times to get used to the vibrations and the pressure you apply the bristles to your teeth and gums.  You have to be gentle and let the toothbrush do the work.  So far so good.  Also has a high end look and feel and the charger is great.  I like it!

Bought for someone else. They are really into charcoal stuff and really like them. I’m not into charcoal stuff therefore I’m not a big fan. I guess the choice is yours......
"
"
I found that they brush better than most of toothbrush i ever tried... And its reaches all my teeth wich is good... And so far it seems the brush does help to remove stain... Anyway it's a good buy... Don't get em if your gums are very sensitive though
"
"
Stiff bristles make these ideal for massaging gums while brushing. I am uncertain the charcoal has any effect but overall a good product.
"
"
I was happy to have found these on amazon as I am not a fan of the charcoal tooth paste so this is a great alternative!
"
"
Satisfaite
"
"
Great product! Came super quickly, quicker then expected. Very highly recommended.

Lasts longer than usual brush
"
"
This toothbrush is a bit on the hard side (I ordered the soft so can only imagine what the medium version feels like, I ha to double check the packaging!) and doesn't really leave me with a ""clean"" feeling.I've used other charcoal bristle toothbrushes which got into all the small spaces between my teeth that left me with a feeling as though I just flossed! Decided to try this one but now I'm stuck with 2 which i'll use but will probably go with the brands i'm used to after these are done.

Decided to try this one but now I'm stuck with 2 which i'll use but will probably go with the brands i'm used to after these are done.

Works !

Works good

if your used to soft bristles you should avoid this one..

Nice

Ordered for my daughter who wanted a compostable toothbrush in recyclable packaging. Got a 4 pack so whole family could try. I love it! I’m used to a fancy traditional toothbrush with all the modern features, a small head, and super soft bristles. Had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. Smooth comfortable handle, very soft bristles of different lengths like any regular toothbrush and did the job as expected. The 4 colours are really nice, and perfect for a family so no one uses the wrong one by accident. I will definitely buy again.

My first time buying biodegradable toothbrushes, but I wanted to make the switch. First off, the packaging is really cute! The different colours as well is nice & fun. The bamboo itself is nice & sturdy in my hand & doesn't feel cheap, feels like good quality. I've been using the toothbrush for over a week now & overall enjoy it, my only 2 complaints (which may not even be a problem for others) is that the top of the brush is kinda big so it's hard for it to reach the very backs of my teeth without doing weird faces & maneuvers. But I'm getting the hang out of it so I don't see it as a problem to have to stop using them. Second, the bristles are literally sooooo soft which could be good for some people but for me I like to brush harder on my teeth & with the soft bristles I feel like it was hard to get them to the cleanliness I like, as well as cleaning the tongue. I thought I'm going to have to press harder on my teeth/tongue & hope for the best & good news, the toothbrush is such good quality that it can withhold my ocd brushing! I haven't had any pieces fall into my mouth at all & the brush still looks as good as new. Also got my fiance to make the switch too!

I was very excited to be able to find a more sustainable toothbrush for our family. This product came with such good reviews, I anxiously purchased them and gave them a try. Unfortunately, I find they do a terrible job of cleaning my teeth. I even changed up my toothpaste to see if that was the culprit and nope. The bristles got soft fast and I find the back molars and the back of my front teeth always feel dirty with this toothbrush. Will not be repurchasing.Wondering why the 3 stars you may ask if I didn't like this product? My husband disagrees with me. He likes the toothbrush and finds it does a fine job. User error? Time will tell, I guess.

If you’re trying  to reduce waste, these are great! But the packaging leaves something to be desired. Each brush is in its own box, with those boxes in another box, then amazon puts it in a plastic bag and then in a box that’s too large for the item. But that’s not the brushes fault.The bristles are very very soft but the brush itself feels bulky.
"
"
Love the concept and effort of the idea, but needs some improvements. Got a splinter in my pinky finger with the first use. haha was not expecting that. Like the fact that the handle is compostable, but the bristles must be removed and can not be recycled in our city. They go right to the landfill. Would not buy these again until the time is right.
"
"
Game changer!!  There is NO REASON whatsoever to buy plastic toothbrushes from store. NOT only are these beautiful, soft and feel so good while brushing... They are NOT going to harm the earth!!  These are cheaper than the plastic ones too.... Love this product... I will never go back... Oh. And it was delivered the same day....
"
"
Bought these for my 8 year old. She says she likes these better then a normal toothbrush. She says they are soft and work good!! She also liked that the bristles come in different colours. I recommend these.
"
"
These toothbrushes are so nice. They last quite a long time. I haven't had any issues with them at all. The only thing that I didn't expect was that if you keep your toothbrushes in a cup and the bottom of the cup it wet, because the toothbrushes are wood, they will get mouldy. But if you clean out the cup regularly or make sure they're dry before you put them back then it's fine.
"
"
Love everything about these! The different colours make it easy for family members to tell their toothbrushes apart, very soft bristles, good for my sensitive teeth! I also love the fact that they are environmentally friendly. Will definitely purchase again in the future!
"
"
The toothbrush is comfortable to handle and the bristles are not too soft or too hard. The fun colors are a plus - helps hubby from using mine! If you are looking for and eco-friendly alternative to regular toothbrushes I recommend giving these a try!

Impressive alternative to the traditional toothbrush.  Bristles are great quality and very soft so they don’t irritate my 6 yr olds gums, the bamboo is soft on the lips and the colours are vibrant.  I’m so happy we purchased these, they made the switch away from plastic so easy that we haven’t even looked back.
"
"
Love the idea but the bristles aren't very good - had to change my toothbrush within a week because the bristles were already collapsing and bending out of shape. Will try a higher quality one next time.
"
"
Tooth brush is nice looking, did the job well.  everything is recyclable... butthis toothbrush after one week I needed to change it ... it's not what I've expected
"
"
It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected. The handle is good for me as I have small hands but it might be a little small for bigger hands. The bristles are delightfully soft but still seem to the job they were designed for. It's just a tiny step on my way to replacing a lot of one use plastic in my life. It's not perfect but it's a step in the right direction and a good price.
"
"
I absolutely love these toothbrushes. The bristles are so soft! The packaging is environmentally friendly and they arrived quite quickly. Plus you get 4, so that's a bonus. I'm a fan.
"
"
Great brushes, gave 3 away and kept one for myself. Very soft and comfortable to use! Great value and cute colours!
"
"
We have had these for a few weeks and so far we love them. They look so cute and work awesome. They are durable and soft. I would buy them again.
"
"
J'ésitais entre doux et moyen. Je suis contente d'avoir opté pour doux, les brosses sont fermes et douces comme je les aime. Je crois que moyen aurait été trop ferme pour moi. Très satisfaite. Je recommande sans hésiter.
"
"
Wont buy again.The bristles are not only very stiff, they are deformed after just one week.
"
"
I was unsure if I would like these as I have sensitive teeth and gums, but they are very gentle, durable, and a great value. I will definitely be buying them again.
"
"
Awesome actually bought these for my puppy for terrh brushing beats the prices or tooth brushes marketed towards dogs.. Extremely soft
"
"
It was more of a good marketing exercise but the product is too poor, please improve at least a little and send me the new version which your marketing promised I was going to get for my money.
"
"
I love my new toothbrushes! The bristles feel so nice - softer than a store-bought plastic toothbrushes version of 'soft' easily!And I like the fun colours. An overall nice toothbrushing experience - will definitely be buying the kid-version for my littles next!
"
"
I feel good using them as I know I’m reducing the plastic we use in our household, but the bristles definitely weren’t designed with the same care as what is available in plastic toothbrushes. The company has room for improvement to expand the design
"
"
I love that the tooth brushes are individually wrapped!  It was so nice to be able to separate them to put in my kid's stockings
"
"
These toothbrushes are wonderful. The bristles are very soft and the bamboo handle makes it easy to brush your teeth. Well worth the money.
"
"
I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought these bamboo toothbrushes but they actually turned out better than I thought. They come in nice colours and the bristles are soft.
"
"
I loved that these toothbrushes were individually packaged,  as I am putting them in everyone's stocking for Christmas!
"
"
This was my family's first adventure into bamboo toothbrushes. We love this one! It's light, comfortable, and the soft. I will be buying these again and again.
"
"
Overall they are good toothbrushes and definitely do the job. However we found the shape of the toothbrush head too big and would prefer atyle with a head that's a little slimmer. Others may not be bothered by this.
"
"
I like the fun colours,  Just started using the toothbrush and so far so good, the brush is soft and gentle on sensitive gums. I am  very happy with my purchase. So happy to be using a  toothbrush that won't end up in the landfill!
"
"
Ne sent pas mauvais et amusant a utilisé
"
"
will continue to use these.Excellent quality
"
"
These tooth brushes are great value, super soft and easy to clean.I love that they are eco friendly and biodegradable.
"
"
Great product. First time using a bamboo toothbrush. Both the bristles and handle get great when using. The toothbrushes came in a great package on top of that. The kid loves the colours.
"
"
as someone who needs to use a soft toothbrush, these are perfect very very soft as well as being more environmentally mindful
"
"
This is my second attempt to use.  They are ok. Weird taste.  But they are ok.
"
"
if buying it to be environmentally friendly not a good product for your teeth and does not last for long, starts to smell after a week.
"
"
Amazing toothbrushs for that price, simple and really soft bristle, does the more than job
"
"
I loooved theese. Someone wrote about splinters tat did not happen with mine.
"
"
Je les ai acheté pour les enfants et ils les ont adopté immédiatement, l'emballage est attirant, la couleur des brosses attrayantes et elles sont très douces donc un succès sur toute la ligne.
"
"
Works great. The bamboo is weird to get used to on the inside of your mouth but it’s worth saving plastic from our oceans. Wish they were a little cheaper.
"
"
Really like them, great for the price. They do feel strange if you’re used to plastic but it’s better for the environment!
"
"
So soft, love it! I am done with plastic toothbrushes.
"
"
I like how the packaging was recyclable as well.
"
"
Toothbrushes are actually soft (unlike others I've tried) and very comfortable to use!
"
"
Love these - wish I could buy them at the grocery store
"
"
Amazing product super soft and teeth feels super clean as well :) just a step closer to more zero waste products !
"
"
I will buy these again. They last well, come in fun Cours, and are great value for the money.
"
"
They are a great size and good quality
"
"
VERY SOFT, LOVED IT.
"
"
They are amazing! I love the different colours! They are pretty soft which I don’t mind but are hard to get the very back teeth cleaned. Just have to go slow so you don’t bang your gums!!
"
"
Biodegradable - I like that a lot!
"
"
I am glad to find that the product is as how advertised - natural, soft bristle, and recyclable packaging.
"
"
These are great! My kids love the colors.
"
"
Boring nothing special
"
"
I like the fact it is good for the environment...and works well as a toothbrush.
"
"
Parfait nous sommes très different
"
"
Happy with the product. Great quality and value.
"
"
Great price, bristles are soft and gentle on the gums, different colours are perfect not to get confused with someone else’s toothbrush!
"
"
these came super fast very soft, great colours. excellent quality
"
"
Super soft bristles, handle is very smooth, good for the environment. No complaints
"
"
Very nice
"
"
Je suis vraiment contente de mon achat. Les poils de la brosse a dent sont vraiment doux. Exactement ce que j'avais besoin.
"
"
Amazing product!!! Everyone should have some if these in their household!! If anyone has this in their wishlist they should  definitely buy it asp!
"
"
Ils sont corrects mais un peu grands pour mon fils
"
"
Super happy with the product.
"
"
very good quality .. . the only problem is that it's a bit too soft
"
"
it is good to support cool company with a good idea
"
"
Love them, they got my kids to brush with out a fight
"
"
Love these!
"
"
Exactly what I was looking for
"
"
Works very well and feels just like any other toothbrush!! Will purchase more in the future!!
"
"
Les poils s abiment très vite
"
"
Super pour toute la famille
"
"

"
"
They are great,  son really likes them.
"
"
Very comfortable. I love using this product
"
"
I like the color. My kids love them so much
"
"
The bristles on the tooth brush are nice and soft, and the product is well made.
"
"
Best toothbrush ever, great quality and fonctionnality
"
"
They are awesome!
"
"
Very nice little brushes
"
"
Excellent product. Bamboo was made from quality material.
"
"
Amazing quality great price
"
"

"
"
Wonderful toothbrush
"
"
Environmentaly friendly
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Great product. Love the colours.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
The product arrived and was as presented and described. They were a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with them. The packaging was cute.
"
"
You're getting exactly what you see in their pictures. Love the curvature of the bristles, and it's a pretty good toothbrush overall. I wouldn't say it's soft, rather 'soft-medium'. Keep the handle base away from water or it'll start turning green, after all, it is bamboo. Would have liked some kind of method to separate the bristles from the brush when recycling, otherwise it's not really fulfilling its full potential!
"
"
I like these! We’ve been cutting down on our plastic waste so when I saw these bamboo toothbrushes I was excited to try them! They’re honestly great, the bristles are soft and I would say they’re a good price considering there in the same price range as a plastic one so why not go this way? Overall I will be purchasing again when I’ve gone through these ones!
"
"
This is my first time trying this product - I am impressed with the quality of it.  The bristles were a little stiff initially but softened up after brushing a few times.  The handle is comfortable.  And too top it off I like that I am contributing positively to the environment in which I live.
"
"
I’m sorry to report that these are not good quality.  I find the bristles start coming out after just a few brushings.  Look for another brand
"
"
Soft and cute,  but the bristles began falling out with minimal use. Definitly not the quality of other bamboo toothbrushes we have purchased.
"
"
Favourite bamboo toothbrush I tried so far. Bristles are ""medium"" feel, which is nice because others I've tried were too rough. Handle not too thick and grips well.
"
"
First time using a bamboo toothbrush. Love the sustainability and that it came with very little packaging waste, which was mostly paper based. I don't like the shape of the toothbrush head- it was too big for me and found it made brushing a bit difficult. I'll be going back to plastic until I can find something that works better for me.
"
"
Love these toothbrushes but while the bristles are soft, my dentist recommends ultra soft bristles for everyone, which are not easy to find. Lavish Essentials toothbrushes that I bought a year ago are ultra soft and carbon bristles that are biodegradable. They also lasted six months each.
"
"
Doux pour les gencives, mais perd à l occasion des poils. A faire attention. Mais reste un bon produit qui favorise le blanchiment des dents.
"
"
Absolutely love these brushes! They are actually so soft as a brush should be and clean well. No concerns with these...the fun colors are a bonus for sure. Great for gifting for a better earth.
"
"
Can't complain. It is exactly what it says it is. It does a good job.
"
"
My purchase came super quick, the packaging is very appealing.  This is my first time using a bamboo toothbrush, Handle feels comfortable while bristles are nice and soft.
"
"
Bon produit, bien présenté et abordable
"
"
Fonctionne très bien, bonne qualité.
"
"
The softness of the bristles is amazing and I love how eco friendly it is! I will definitely repurchase!
"
"
Love these tooth brushes. As do all of my kids and husband.
"
"
Reduce your plastic waste!
"
"
These are super cute, the marketing and colours are adorable, but they hurt so much when brushing, the bristles are really stiff and they don’t soften with time. The value for the price is great, but not at the risk of my gum health. I use them for guests’ one time use.
"
"
Ordered for my daughter who wanted a compostable toothbrush in recyclable packaging. Got a 4 pack so whole family could try. I love it! I’m used to a fancy traditional toothbrush with all the modern features, a small head, and super soft bristles. Had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised.

I was very excited to be able to find a more sustainable toothbrush for our family. This product came with such good reviews, I anxiously purchased them and gave them a try. Unfortunately, I find they do a terrible job of cleaning my teeth. I even changed up my toothpaste to see if that was the culprit and nope.

Will not be repurchasing.Wondering why the 3 stars you may ask if I didn't like this product? My husband disagrees with me. He likes the toothbrush and finds it does a fine job. User error? Time will tell, I guess.

Love the concept and effort of the idea, but needs some improvements. Got a splinter in my pinky finger with the first use. haha was not expecting that.

It's not perfect but it's a step in the right direction and a good price.
"
"
I absolutely love these toothbrushes. The bristles are so soft! The packaging is environmentally friendly and they arrived quite quickly. Plus you get 4, so that's a bonus. I'm a fan.
"
"
Great brushes, gave 3 away and kept one for myself. Very soft and comfortable to use! Great value and cute colours!
"
"
We have had these for a few weeks and so far we love them. They look so cute and work awesome. They are durable and soft. I would buy them again.
"
"
J'ésitais entre doux et moyen. Je suis contente d'avoir opté pour doux, les brosses sont fermes et douces comme je les aime. Je crois que moyen aurait été trop ferme pour moi. Très satisfaite. Je recommande sans hésiter.
"
"
Wont buy again.The bristles are not only very stiff, they are deformed after just one week.
"
"
I was unsure if I would like these as I have sensitive teeth and gums, but they are very gentle, durable, and a great value. I will definitely be buying them again.
"
"
Awesome actually bought these for my puppy for terrh brushing beats the prices or tooth brushes marketed towards dogs.. Extremely soft
"
"
It was more of a good marketing exercise but the product is too poor, please improve at least a little and send me the new version which your marketing promised I was going to get for my money.
"
"
I love my new toothbrushes! The bristles feel so nice - softer than a store-bought plastic toothbrushes version of 'soft' easily!And I like the fun colours. An overall nice toothbrushing experience - will definitely be buying the kid-version for my littles next!
"
"
I feel good using them as I know I’m reducing the plastic we use in our household, but the bristles definitely weren’t designed with the same care as what is available in plastic toothbrushes. The company has room for improvement to expand the design
"
"
I love that the tooth brushes are individually wrapped!  It was so nice to be able to separate them to put in my kid's stockings
"
"
These toothbrushes are wonderful. The bristles are very soft and the bamboo handle makes it easy to brush your teeth. Well worth the money.
"
"
I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought these bamboo toothbrushes but they actually turned out better than I thought. They come in nice colours and the bristles are soft.
"
"
I loved that these toothbrushes were individually packaged,  as I am putting them in everyone's stocking for Christmas!
"
"
This was my family's first adventure into bamboo toothbrushes. We love this one! It's light, comfortable, and the soft. I will be buying these again and again.
"
"
Overall they are good toothbrushes and definitely do the job. However we found the shape of the toothbrush head too big and would prefer atyle with a head that's a little slimmer. Others may not be bothered by this.
"
"
I like the fun colours,  Just started using the toothbrush and so far so good, the brush is soft and gentle on sensitive gums. I am  very happy with my purchase. So happy to be using a  toothbrush that won't end up in the landfill!
"
"
Ne sent pas mauvais et amusant a utilisé
"
"
will continue to use these.Excellent quality
"
"
These tooth brushes are great value, super soft and easy to clean.I love that they are eco friendly and biodegradable.
"
"
Great product. First time using a bamboo toothbrush. Both the bristles and handle get great when using. The toothbrushes came in a great package on top of that. The kid loves the colours.
"
"
as someone who needs to use a soft toothbrush, these are perfect very very soft as well as being more environmentally mindful
"
"
This is my second attempt to use.  They are ok. Weird taste.  But they are ok.
"
"
if buying it to be environmentally friendly not a good product for your teeth and does not last for long, starts to smell after a week.
"
"
Amazing toothbrushs for that price, simple and really soft bristle, does the more than job
"
"
I loooved theese. Someone wrote about splinters tat did not happen with mine.
"
"
Je les ai acheté pour les enfants et ils les ont adopté immédiatement, l'emballage est attirant, la couleur des brosses attrayantes et elles sont très douces donc un succès sur toute la ligne.
"
"
Works great. The bamboo is weird to get used to on the inside of your mouth but it’s worth saving plastic from our oceans. Wish they were a little cheaper.
"
"
Really like them, great for the price. They do feel strange if you’re used to plastic but it’s better for the environment!
"
"
So soft, love it! I am done with plastic toothbrushes.
"
"
I like how the packaging was recyclable as well.
"
"
Toothbrushes are actually soft (unlike others I've tried) and very comfortable to use!
"
"
Love these - wish I could buy them at the grocery store
"
"
Amazing product super soft and teeth feels super clean as well :) just a step closer to more zero waste products !
"
"
I will buy these again. They last well, come in fun Cours, and are great value for the money.
"
"
They are a great size and good quality
"
"
VERY SOFT, LOVED IT.
"
"
They are amazing! I love the different colours! They are pretty soft which I don’t mind but are hard to get the very back teeth cleaned. Just have to go slow so you don’t bang your gums!!
"
"
Biodegradable - I like that a lot!
"
"
I am glad to find that the product is as how advertised - natural, soft bristle, and recyclable packaging.
"
"
These are great! My kids love the colors.
"
"
Boring nothing special
"
"
I like the fact it is good for the environment...and works well as a toothbrush.
"
"
Parfait nous sommes très different
"
"
Happy with the product. Great quality and value.
"
"
Great price, bristles are soft and gentle on the gums, different colours are perfect not to get confused with someone else’s toothbrush!
"
"
these came super fast very soft, great colours. excellent quality
"
"
Super soft bristles, handle is very smooth, good for the environment. No complaints
"
"
Very nice
"
"
Je suis vraiment contente de mon achat. Les poils de la brosse a dent sont vraiment doux. Exactement ce que j'avais besoin.
"
"
Amazing product!!! Everyone should have some if these in their household!! If anyone has this in their wishlist they should  definitely buy it asp!
"
"
Ils sont corrects mais un peu grands pour mon fils
"
"
Super happy with the product.
"
"
very good quality .. . the only problem is that it's a bit too soft
"
"
it is good to support cool company with a good idea
"
"
Love them, they got my kids to brush with out a fight
"
"
Love these!
"
"
Exactly what I was looking for
"
"
Works very well and feels just like any other toothbrush!! Will purchase more in the future!!
"
"
Les poils s abiment très vite
"
"
Super pour toute la famille
"
"

"
"
They are great,  son really likes them.
"
"
Very comfortable. I love using this product
"
"
I like the color. My kids love them so much
"
"
The bristles on the tooth brush are nice and soft, and the product is well made.
"
"
Best toothbrush ever, great quality and fonctionnality
"
"
They are awesome!
"
"
Very nice little brushes
"
"
Excellent product. Bamboo was made from quality material.
"
"
Amazing quality great price
"
"
The toothbrushes are exactly as pictured!
"
"
Wonderful toothbrush
"
"
Environmentaly friendly
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Great product. Love the colours.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
The product arrived and was as presented and described. They were a gift for my daughter and she is very happy with them. The packaging was cute.
"
"
You're getting exactly what you see in their pictures. Love the curvature of the bristles, and it's a pretty good toothbrush overall. I wouldn't say it's soft, rather 'soft-medium'. Keep the handle base away from water or it'll start turning green, after all, it is bamboo. Would have liked some kind of method to separate the bristles from the brush when recycling, otherwise it's not really fulfilling its full potential!
"
"
I like these! We’ve been cutting down on our plastic waste so when I saw these bamboo toothbrushes I was excited to try them! They’re honestly great, the bristles are soft and I would say they’re a good price considering there in the same price range as a plastic one so why not go this way? Overall I will be purchasing again when I’ve gone through these ones!
"
"
This is my first time trying this product - I am impressed with the quality of it.  The bristles were a little stiff initially but softened up after brushing a few times.  The handle is comfortable.  And too top it off I like that I am contributing positively to the environment in which I live.
"
"
I’m sorry to report that these are not good quality.  I find the bristles start coming out after just a few brushings.  Look for another brand
"
"
Soft and cute,  but the bristles began falling out with minimal use. Definitly not the quality of other bamboo toothbrushes we have purchased.
"
"
Favourite bamboo toothbrush I tried so far. Bristles are ""medium"" feel, which is nice because others I've tried were too rough. Handle not too thick and grips well.
"
"
First time using a bamboo toothbrush. Love the sustainability and that it came with very little packaging waste, which was mostly paper based. I don't like the shape of the toothbrush head- it was too big for me and found it made brushing a bit difficult. I'll be going back to plastic until I can find something that works better for me.
"
"
Love these toothbrushes but while the bristles are soft, my dentist recommends ultra soft bristles for everyone, which are not easy to find. Lavish Essentials toothbrushes that I bought a year ago are ultra soft and carbon bristles that are biodegradable. They also lasted six months each.
"
"
Doux pour les gencives, mais perd à l occasion des poils. A faire attention. Mais reste un bon produit qui favorise le blanchiment des dents.
"
"
Absolutely love these brushes! They are actually so soft as a brush should be and clean well. No concerns with these...the fun colors are a bonus for sure. Great for gifting for a better earth.
"
"
Can't complain. It is exactly what it says it is. It does a good job.
"
"
My purchase came super quick, the packaging is very appealing.  This is my first time using a bamboo toothbrush, Handle feels comfortable while bristles are nice and soft.
"
"
Bon produit, bien présenté et abordable
"
"
Fonctionne très bien, bonne qualité.
"
"
The softness of the bristles is amazing and I love how eco friendly it is! I will definitely repurchase!
"
"
Love these tooth brushes. As do all of my kids and husband.
"
"
Reduce your plastic waste!
"
"
These are super cute, the marketing and colours are adorable, but they hurt so much when brushing, the bristles are really stiff and they don’t soften with time. The value for the price is great, but not at the risk of my gum health. I use them for guests’ one time use.
"
"
This arrived damaged. The package is supposed to be sealed, but the bottom part was already detached to open. I took one toothbrush out through the seal-broken bottom, then I found a toothbrush with dirt and dusts along with a few plastic bristles stuck out from the brush. I called and questioned an Amazon Customer Service representative whether the condition could be regarded acceptable or not because it'll be used in the mouth so that I got more concerned; well, he said the packaged is supposed to be completely sealed! Therefore, I'm not really sure of detailed qualities at all; I threw them away right after I talked to the representative.
"
"
I have been using Colgate slim soft brushes for a very longtime and decided to give these a try after reading a review from a customer stating they are never going back to the name brand tooth brushes. I can tell you this , if you think these brushes are really that good then you have never tried a good brush. Some people may really like these but I will not purchase them again.Colgate slim soft brush bristles are thinner and a little longer which makes them much easier to get into areas of the mouth that these brushes have a hard time doing.
"
"
The softness of this brush is really good and it gets softer after 2nd to 3rd usage. It doesnt pick up bad smell and the bristles are cleaning well. Great quality and great price for the pack. I was searching for one as soft from previous brands and they were rough causing my gums to bleed and it was painful. This is only for those who seek for softness, this one is really good.
"
"
The toothbrushes are really soft, delivered on time. If you are looking for a soft toothbrush and using coconut charcoal toothpaste...? I would recommend this and has value for the money.
"
"
I really enjoy using these as well with my family. I think they are much better than the regular toothbrushes. I'll definitely be buying these again
"
"
It is a great brush. It was not as soft as I was hoping, hard on younger children, my older child who is an adult loved it.
"
"
not as soft as I hoped, but long lasting and the bristles are just the right size ,not too thick, for nice brushing.
"
"
Amazing product and was delivered in few days due to this situation and still i am totally satisfied with the service and the product both. Its soft doesn’t hurt your teeth even if u brush it hard and you feel so smooth and soft inside.
"
"
Beautiful soft brushes but by the 2nd use noticed a few bristles came loose but no more since so may have beeb strays
"
"
Love these toothbrushes, I have very very sensitive teeth and weak enamel)gums. My gums don't bleed when I use these , very happy

I have a tough time finding soft toothbrushes that are actually soft yet are effective at cleaning.  Just got these a couple of weeks ago and first impression I am very pleased.
"
"
Good for brushing your teeth
"
"
Good value, a little too soft thou
"
"
Douce et belle.
"

I like them
"

Bristles are crazy soft but still firm and unlike any tooth brush i have used. My teeth felt clean and super smooth. Never going back to the big names again.
"
"
I bought this item for myself. Compare to my current tooth brush, it is much softer. I like to the feeling of it touches my tooth. I like it very much.

I am very happy with my purchase.  The toothbrush are just soft enough if you have receding and sensitive gums.  this is what my dentist suggested I should use.  Very soft toothbrush are very hard to find in regular stores or drugstores.  they normally go by the category ""ultra soft"".The last one I got in  a regular store was made by one of the big names (C........gate).  These were the most uncomfortable toothbrush I have use to date.  The handle kept on rotating in my hand and I couldn't get a good hold on the darn thing.  You will think, these big name have been making toothbrushes for many decades, they should get it down path by now.  But NO it was very unwieldy.The handle of these toothbrushes are very comfortable in your hand and are very easy to use.  I will buy them again.

As I make my own activated charcoal toothpaste, it's important to have black bristles for my appeal.These are awesome, wouldn't say they are soft, more like medium soft.I like the size of head as it's small enough to reach those tough spots but still usable for adults & kids.My ONLY con to this brush set is all of them look the same, and this makes it a bit challenging when more than one family member wants to use them.

If you are looking for a truly soft toothbrush, that is wide enough to feel effective, this brush is for you. This toothbrush is just as soft as the ones provided by my dentist, but much wider. No discomfort at all, and teeth feel very clean afterwards.I like the modern look to these toothbrushes, and the price is fantastic. This is our new favourite brush.

I am really very pleased with this toothbrush. Before I bought it I read a number of reviews including the bad one and had a couple of concerns about buying, but I'm really happy I went ahead and bought. The first thing I did was read the instructions and felt that the negative reviews came from people who did not read how to use their brush. One example was someone said they were annoyed how the brush would hesitate how every so often, but what that is is a 30 second timer so you can ensure that you brush your teeth equally in every part of your mouth. People complained that the charging time took too long. What I learned was that the FIRST charging takes 22 hours then after that you leave the brush on the charger and its always available when you want to brush. The instructions direct that once every 6 months you let the builtin battery run right down and then you give it the full 22 hour recharge.I am finding that in 1 short month my teeth feel much cleaner and with the help of whitening tooth paste and whitening mouthrinse my teeth are starting to look whiter. It was not an overnight thing but a gradual change. I'm now recommending this brush to everyone I kmow.
"
"
Let me set the stage... I brush my teeth at least twice a day and typically three times.  I find flossing tedious and most days I don't bother.  My dentist suggested this type of brush as part of helping to address some gum irritation. This thing is great.  Tooth brushing no longer feels like and awkward messy chore.  It is quick, clean and I can feel the difference - teeth have that slick, just left the dentist feel. I like the pressure sensor that notifies me if I am pressing harder than I should.I was worried about travel and having it run out or needing to make sure it was always  in the charger. Not a concern. I cheated it overnight when it arrived. I have purposely not charged it again since then.  A week later, it is still going strong without a charge.
"

Love love love this toothbrush! We've since bought another Oral-B electric toothbrush (different type) from the drugstore and I don't like it nearly as much. The PRO 1000 has a timer that goes off every 30 seconds—with a longer vibration at the 2-minute mark—so you spend the correct amount of time brushing each quarter of your mouth. The charge lasts for days at a time and we just leave it on the charger overnight when it's running low. If you push too hard while brushing, it makes a weird noise so you know to ease up (a problem my husband's had in the past). I also appreciate the light on the front: if it's running low, a red light will start flashing so you know it's time to charge.
"

The toothbrush itself is excellent, however the recharging pod has not worked. The battery lasted a while, but would not be recharged by the accompanying pod. Since my partner has a similar Oral-B, I used her charger pod, and it recharged my toothbrush just fine.  There should be a long enough warranty coming with these pods, 3 months is not enough, as it takes longer to know if it works.

I bought this to replace another similar unit that simply wasn't holding a charge anymore.If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get.  You don't need anything fancy, they're not going to clean your teeth better than this, and it will pulse every 30 seconds as well as an extra at the 2 minute mark to let you know whey're you're done.  You don't need a digital timer in the handle that you're not going to see anyway.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush.  I do find it a bit noisy, but that doesn't affect my review.  As this is a new thing for me, I can't compare the vibration to anything else, it just seems a little more rough than I anticipated.  But nonetheless, this brush makes me feel like I get a much better clean than my manual brush.  I really like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area.I chose this brush instead of the next step up because the others are all ""smart"" brushes and have apps you can put on your phone.  Last thing I need is an app for my toothbrush.I spoke with a dentist who is a good friend of mine, and she was happy to hear I purchased this.  It is the same brush that her and her husband have, so I suppose I made a good choice!

Agréablement surprise. C'était un achat impulsif du black Friday, mais je ne reviendrai  pas à une brosse à dent normale. Le brossage est incroyable, surtout pour les dents du fond, plus difficile à bien brosser. La charge dure longtemps. Je n'ai pas de prise de courant dans ma salle de bain, mais ce n'est pas un problème car une charge dure un peu plus de deux semaines (deux brossages par jour).

It's a good electronic toothbrush for what it is. You get one setting, and to me that isn't a problem at all as I use it exclusively for only brushing.The only complaints I have with this toothbrush are:1) It's on the loud side compared to my prior electric toothbrush that kicked the bucket.2) The toothbrush does not shutoff on its lonesome after 2 minutes. It does vibrate/beep slightly differently at the two minute mark to let you know that the recommended time has elapsed.
"
"
When you don't need the nutty bells and whistles, this model works fine.  Can't really comment on battery life, since they go back on the charger after each use.  The manual recommends a complete discharge every 6 months, so I've marked my calendar for December.  These replace a single brush, with multiple heads, that we used for 10 years before the battery finally couldn't hold enough juice to spin the brush fast enough for a proper clean.  We never did the periodic discharge with that one, though, so maybe these will last 15 years...

I am quite pleased with this toothbrush, especially since I was able to get it on sale! Its full retail price is a bit much in my opinion, given that it only includes one brush head. If it included a second brush head, the price would be more reasonable. But my favourite things about this toothbrush are that it lasts quite a long time (I can usually go about a full week, brushing twice a day, before having to recharge it - it takes about a full day to charge completely) and it also has vibration notifications every 30 seconds which I find very helpful for knowing how long to spend brushing each section of my teeth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back). My old electric toothbrush would buzz after two minutes, but I like that this one buzzes every 30 seconds to guide you. Overall I'm very happy with it and would definitely recommend it, although I would also recommend trying to get it on sale if you can or perhaps finding one with an additional brush head included.
"

I am really very pleased with this toothbrush. Before I bought it I read a number of reviews including the bad one and had a couple of concerns about buying, but I'm really happy I went ahead and bought. The first thing I did was read the instructions and felt that the negative reviews came from people who did not read how to use their brush. One example was someone said they were annoyed how the brush would hesitate how every so often, but what that is is a 30 second timer so you can ensure that you brush your teeth equally in every part of your mouth. People complained that the charging time took too long. What I learned was that the FIRST charging takes 22 hours then after that you leave the brush on the charger and its always available when you want to brush. The instructions direct that once every 6 months you let the builtin battery run right down and then you give it the full 22 hour recharge.I am finding that in 1 short month my teeth feel much cleaner and with the help of whitening tooth paste and whitening mouthrinse my teeth are starting to look whiter. It was not an overnight thing but a gradual change. I'm now recommending this brush to everyone I kmow.
"
"
Let me set the stage... I brush my teeth at least twice a day and typically three times.  I find flossing tedious and most days I don't bother.  My dentist suggested this type of brush as part of helping to address some gum irritation. This thing is great.  Tooth brushing no longer feels like and awkward messy chore.  It is quick, clean and I can feel the difference - teeth have that slick, just left the dentist feel. I like the pressure sensor that notifies me if I am pressing harder than I should.I was worried about travel and having it run out or needing to make sure it was always  in the charger. Not a concern. I cheated it overnight when it arrived. I have purposely not charged it again since then.  A week later, it is still going strong without a charge.

Good quality except the brisstle it fizzled out very fast. Has to be replaced (of course using it as it should be)...

I've been using Oral-B toothbrushes for almost twenty years. I use an Oral-B Genius 8000 toothbrush at home, and decided to purchase another one to carry with me to work to brush my teeth after lunch. I opted to buy a cheaper model the Oral-B Pro 1000. What I like about the 1000 model is that it does as good a job brushing my teeth compared to the 8000. I usually only use the ""normal"" brushing mode in the 8000, which is pretty much the same as the 1000 experience. The 1000 model has a slimmer handle, which I prefer in my hand, compared to the ""chubbier"" 8000 handle. The only downside of the 1000 is the Ni-Cad battery; the Li-Ion battery of the 8000 model is far superior. I'm satisfied with the 1000 model and recommend it!
"
"
For some reason, there doesn't seem to be a proper seal on this brush. I use it, rinse it off, put it in the stand. And my stand ends up with a ring of blue from toothpaste dripping out of the handle. I've had Oral-B brushes before and never had this problem. Not very happy with this purchase. The brush works and feels good to use; but messy to have standing on my bathroom vanity.UPDATE: To be more clear, when I rinse the brush off, I do so under running water while the brush is still running. I remove the head, rinse the post, dry off the handle, and put the brush back on. The blue ring that repeatedly forms on my base occurs despite these efforts to keep the brush clean. And I've owned an Oral-B before without experiencing this leaking issue.
"
"
When new this toothbrush works very well. The 30 second timer is great and I like the size of the toothbrush. I never really felt like it cleaned better than the cheaper model that you can get for half the price. It doesn't seem like the movement is any faster than the cheap one, so what's the point of paying more?Despite it not really performing better than the cheap one, I did like this toothbrush until it stopped working. It looks like the problem is that it won't charge, but I've tried it on two identical chargers, so the problem is the toothbrush itself. I didn't spend a premium on a toothbrush only for it to fail after 3 months (July to October). After reading some of the other reviews it appears that early failure is a common problem, so I definitely won't buy Oral-B again. It's too bad because previous cheaper toothbrushes from them lasted many years.

I bought this after using Philips sonicare for many years. I decided to change as the replacement head for the sonicare was expensive and it did not seam to clean as thoroughly. I also had water getting in between the handle and the brush heads that lead to decline in the intensity of vibration. So far this product has been good as it rotates instead of vibrating and cleans better.
"
"
First if I’m never going back to manual brushes. This is a practical electric toothbrush with out the extra frills. Great for practical no nonsense people that want simplicity.I use with cross action head and I’m thoroughly satisfied.I have so much more access to the surface area of my teeth and gums.I actually enjoy using this thing.This would be great for kids, it works with the kids brush heads too. Awesome way to thoroughly clean young children’s teeth.Slime issue...So I read a few reviews about the “slime” issue.That slime is actually a mixture of the user’s saliva and toothpaste created while brushing. It drips down your mouth and onto the brush and gets into the part the brush head sits on.So it’s not the toothbrushes fault or Oral B.Just clean your brush by rinsing it.The toothbrush instructions on the package specifically say to pop off the head and rinse the two pieces under the running water after each use.So there you have it, all you have to do is rinse as you would a manual brush.
"
"
I jumped on the electric toothbrush bandwagon so late but I'm never going back to a regular tooth brush!Buy one that rotates instead of one that just oscillates back and forth because they clean better.The battery lasts for about 7 days and charging takes like 24 hours.Super easy to clean, just run it under water and dry it with a towel.2-min timer function makes sure you clean sufficiently. My dentist has noticed a difference in my oral health!I wish the vibration every 30-seconds was stronger, sometimes in the morning when your tired you don't notice it. The vibration at the end of the 2-mins is strong enough.Despite what the manual that came with it says, it does not have different brushing ""modes""! The power button turns it on/off, that's it. Though I don't care about those different ""modes"" it does the intended job sufficiently!The ""pressure sensor"" is not noticeable at all, I don't notice a difference in the ""pulsation"" no matter how light or hard I brush!
"
"
This toothbrush is ""ok"".. I've had two sonicares, which I prefer because they both had is a ""smoother"" type of brushing and were much less noisy.This Oral B electric tooth brush is very loud...I was surprised. The timer seems fine and I have not yet travelled with it. Also, the round brush is bigger and differently shaped than the one on the sonicare.  I have a small mouth, so, it took me some getting used to using it.  I'm sure it cleans the teeth fine.The price of the Oral B is less than 1/2 the price of the sonicare, which is a benefit.
"
"
Franchement, ya tu du monde qui aime ça ?Malgré ce que les écrits laissent entendre, il y A PAS d'ajustement de pression.. c'est ""full blast"" tout le temps.  La tête de brossage qui vient avec est très rigide.  Même les neurones me tremblent.  Je vais essayer de la retourner, ça juste pas de bon sens
"
"
This toothbrush is way too loud. Sounds like there is a drill in your mouth. It also doesn’t feel like it’s cleaning my teeth as well.I don’t know if it’s just this model, as it is the entry level one.I bought this after using the sonic care and was not impressed.Will be returning this product.
"

Quality toothbrush. Long lasting. The charger will die on you though before the toothbrush. Not sure if there's replacement chargers for these things? Hopefully! I just bought a brand new one because my old one's charger died. I won't be doing it again , will switch brands if the charger dies again.Black will show toothpaste ""spills"" and drips more, so I kind of wish I got the white version.After a few months, you will notice it doesn't hold a charge as long , as with most things.I haven't actually noticed or used the timer function which it says it has?Not ideal for traveling because you'll have to bring this AND your charger because it will not last for a whole week vacation. Easier to just pack a manual toothbrush for travel.
"
"
I got this as a gift and unfortunately, it didn't hold any charge. It only works for about 2 charges and then dies IMMEDIATELY and is never full when it's charging. I'm not sure how to return it and get a new one since all they say is ""return and we'll give you back your money""....I just want one that works!!
"
"
Excellent for Senior.....I recently purchased a 2nd oral B power toothbrush gift for my 82 yr ole mother.  She absolutely loves the oral B....it was recommended by her dentist to get power brush....oral B is a lot softer and safer brushing on her receding gums....the timer works great not to over clean....charge needed approx. once every 3 weeks...Cleans better then a normal toothbrush, and ez to clean every single tooth and especially the molars in the back.  I purchased one last year for my hubby - xmas gift.....the brush tip lasted him 1 year.....they both highly recommend this product!!!....Fast shipping and delivery with Amazon.

This toothbrush for me was a significant upgrade over conventional toothbrushes. The brush allowed me to better clean my bracers and teeth significantly improving my oral hygiene with it's capabilities. That being said, I initially purchased this specific version due to the lower price however it isn't truly indicative of the full cost picture. The toothbrush alone for the cost was good but the replacement heads are simply out there.For bracers, I found it best to just use the Cross action head that came with it instead of their other floss action, bracers specific whatever. If you want to clean you will need the cross action.Overall I'm quite satisfied with the purchase, nothing really wrong with it except the cost of replacement heads. I've tried third party replacements and they don't do as good a job for my bracers.
"
"
It seems like a good toothbrush for some, but it doesnt work for me.There was no indication for brushing too hard, and the bristles kept getting stuck in the wire behind my bottom teeth. I had to go to the orthodontist to get one of the bristles removed, so I'm going to try and return the brush.If you have mobility issues it seems like a great toothbrush, but I think I'm going to go back to a regular toothbrush.
"
"
I had an older model of the Philips Sonicare brush, and thought when it wore out it would be interesting to try a different type of brush. I think I like this brush even more. It is definitely a little less sophisticated (i.e., no automatic shut off after the 4 quarters are done), but honestly, that all is a bit of a gimmick in my book. What I like about this brush is the head can get back to the very back teeth much more easily, and those are the teeth my dental care experts mostly gripe about. So with this, I think they will have far less to complain about. I feel it does a very good job. More than satisfied, and I recommend this product.
"
"
This toothbrush sounds like a diesel truck on a cold winter morning. After you place ear plugs in and turn this bad boy on you'll get 40 seconds of clean operation. Then your saliva will have accumulated enough from the toothpaste/ saliva hybrid to fill the toothbrush arm slots(unsure of their purpose) and the mess begins. It literally sprays your hybrid mouth juices out of those slots. Makes an absolute mess unless completing this task in the shower. 2 stars because my teeth look and feel clean. Unlike my counter tops.
"
"
I picked up 2 of these during the Black Friday sale. I'm wondering why I hadn't bought them sooner. They work fantastic. I had been using the cheap Oral-B battery operated brushes for years and I thought they were doing a good job. Boy was I mistaken. There is a definite difference in cleanliness using this brush. I also like the fact it pulses to let you know to switch the area you're brushing every 30 seconds. My only gripe is that it's pretty rough out of the box. It's a bit cumbersome to change how vigorously it cleans.
"
"
So I tried this out for a week. It was just okay.I just don’t like the circular brush head. Yes it cleans one tooth at a time. But it actually hurts my gums.It’s also very loud. I mean very loud.And it doesn’t come with a case so it’s not good for traveling.I love the sonic toothbrush. It’s just better.
"
"
I purchased this toothbrush as a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves . It's quiet a full charge has last so far over a week it looks great it feels great in the hand and she says she would never go back to an ordinary toothbrush again. The plastics it's made of appear to be very high quality and is waterproof and can be used in the shower or bath without any worry . I'm going to buy one for myself and I highly recommend . Thank you Amazon
"
"
Further to original review, after three weeks of use, this toothbrush no longer holds a charge.  I’m not sure why.  Too bad as the toothbrush is great but would be better if the charge held for several days.  Others in my family have no issues with theirs so this one must be a bum one:(Love this! Great cost  for product.  Toothbrush holds charge for a week plus and feels great.  Would buy again.
"
"
PERFECT replacement for my +10yr old previous Oral-B. Nothing fancy (it's a toothbrush, for heaven's sake) but excellent strength, love the quadrant signals, and the small recharger stand (perfect for limited space near our sink.) No toothbrush head holder, but my husband and I simply store each of ours in a small shot-glass size container in the drawer beneath our sink. On that note: this comes with one head only. Recommend ordering replacements when you buy this unit. The generic heads we bought with this unit were also fabulous.
"
"
My dentist always nagged me for brushing too hard and ruining my enamel. This toothbrush lets me brush without worry of using too much pressure and it's done such a good job on my teeth. Make sure to let it charge for 22-24 hours the first time you plug it in. After that it's quite good for battery life! This is my first ever electronic toothbrush and I'm really happy I made the purchase.
"
"
I'll try to use for a few days but the first time I saw blood which never happened in Sonicare. I was extra careful not to push in.I also just noticed that this product was released in 2011...that explains the outdated specs like no 220v support. Sonicare can be taken out of the country without fuss.
"
"
I used to have a Braun 5000 model but I was not using any of the various modes. So I bought this one with only one function, the one I was using all the time with the 5000 model... for 50$ instead of 250$.I’m very satisfied but I am missing the timer that came with the 5000 model. I’ll get used to look at the clock.The brushing is fantastic, my older one was 7 years old so this one must incorporate new technology.
"
"
This Braun 1000 model has great basic functionality and does a really fine job.  It only has one speed, but that is all you'll ever need.  All of my previously purchased brush heads fit perfectly on this replacement Braun toothbrush.  For the price, this has been a great purchase.
"
"
Pros: I upgraded from one of those $30 Oral-B brushes and found this to be a much better cleaning experience. It's a powerful brush with a very solid battery. Comes with a handy travel case.Cons: Just one issue with it - the handle is not designed to fit in your hand very well. It's wider at the bottom instead of at the top. So instead of it resting in the natural grip of your hand, you have to hold it firmly to keep it from falling. My brush has slipped from my hand many times and it's quite frustrating.
"
"
Might have received a faulty unit but the device stopped working within two months of purchase.. Was fully operational when it was working but the device can't seem to turn on. Charging pod looks fine, the indicator light flickers so it tells me that it is charging. Now I am stuck dealing with the manufacturer for the warranty, otherwise a great electric toothbrush.
"
"
Good toothbrush with a great battery life.+ Battery remains charged for a long time+ Great vibration/action+ Feels like it is well built+/- Had an issue with the motor, took it in for service and received a free upgrade! :)+/- Charging is very slow (Usually makes the battery's life longer)-Timer function is useless (Do all of your teeth, not some for the allotted time)
"
"
I bought this because my battery was failing on the one I had on for six years. The difference between this battery and that one is not the best. Maybe I should’ve gone up in the model but I don’t need all the time or Bluetooth and app functions. It’s just brushing yo teeth. I wish they would just put a dope ass battery in this thing and call it a day.
"
"
It was a gift, I’ve had no complaints. I have a cheaper model of OralB and I wouldn’t want to go without it, cleans better than a manual toothbrush and my dentist complimented me on my oral hygene. Woukd recommend ysing the sensitive brush regardless of whether your teeth are sensitive or not.
"
"
What can I say? It's an electric toothbrush. It is very fast and my teeth feel more cleaned than the manual ones I have used all my life. It has a 30 second timer between areas you need to brush too which is cool. The battery lasts a long time but prepared to clean the charger/stand as water and toothpaste residue will drip onto it--it won't damage anything but it just looks gross if you leave it too long.  Wish it included a travel head for it.
"
"
Elle fonctionne vraiment bien. La puissance est au rendez-vous
"
"
I bought this to replace my 7 year old oral-b toothbrush, but I didn't realize it only has one speed - fast. I prefer the slower speed or at least having the option to pick between the two. Not a huge problem, my fault for not reading all the features properly. I'm not returning it, I'll just deal with this one for the next few years and hopefully remember to look for multi-speed when I need another new one! :)
"
"
I bought this a week ago. The charger pod does not work! I took it off the charger for two days, and the battery is almost dead. I put it back on the charger, and it is still flashing! Note: I gave it an initial charge time of 24 hours when I first received it. Am definitely sending this back! I notice that there is no response for all of the complaints, either!
"
"
I checked other equivalent products and settled for this one. It was a good decision. It meets all the requirements expected of a tooth brushing tool and specs as advertised. I bought two one for my wife and one for myself. We have this product now for two months and it is a great product. I also bought the replacement heads that were on special price. Highly recommend.
"
"
This was my first electronic toothbrush. I found the toothbrush very loud and the vibration really strong. The battery would last about a week before needing recharging, however, this toothbrush stopped working entirely just over 3 months after buying it. I would not recommend it for travelling as it did not come with a cap for the toothbrush or any type of carrying case. The return window was very short so I can't return it. I would not recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
I've been using this brand of toothbrush since its inception.....I love the way it works, and all I can say is that I rarely if ever have had a cavity since using it.  I cant recommend it highly enough.
"
"
Great toothbrush! So good I bought 3 more for the rest of the family.. I got it for $30 black Friday deal, totally worth it. Otherwise I would buy the 500 model as it's the exact same product without the battery indicator. I have both.Cleans way better than a regular brush, 30 sec timer is quite useful, it recharges fast and has a good life between charges. I charge mine once a week.
"
"
My teeth have never felt this clean in my whole life before. I feel like I just came back from the dentist every time I use this brush. Furthermore, the small roundhead makes it easy for me to get to those hard to reach places in my mouth. I've been told by my dentist that I have an extremely small mouth and my jaw doesn't open very wide, which led to some problems with my back teeth... however with this product I can clean those teeth properly. Highly recommend this product
"
"
Nice buy in this price range, it's not as loud as most other devices. Compatible with all ProB heads and chargers which is a bonus. I've been testing how long a full charge lasts and so far I'm up to 3 days easily using 2-3 times daily and following the built in timer. Charging to full is a long process though, over 12 hours. Comes in original package with 1 brush head and $10 coupon for additional heads.
"
"
The toothbrush was great until the charging dock stopped working! Considering that I do not charge the brush frequently (once every 5 days, rather than having it continuously on the dock), it's pretty baffling how this could've happened.I'm also quite bothered that there isn't a way for me to contact the seller via amazon, I've looked and looked to find an interface without success...feeling quite frustrated.
"
"
Wanted a simple unit from Oral B as this is my 3rd unit in 20 years. Product is exceptionally comfortable to hold and takes up very little space on my bathroom counter top.Yes I recommend to buy 100%Oral B please do not stop manufacturing this Non-Wi-Fi simple unit for those of us who desire the basics!Thanks
"
"
I picked this up during the Black Friday deals at a great price.  We have always purchased the cheap battery operated tooth brushes. This has a charger base that you put the tooth brush on. Light indicator shows charge remaining.  Charging time is AMAZING!  we should have tried this long ago.
"
"
I love this product! I wouldn't wanna travel with this though personally (if you wanted to you could but i'd rather just buy a cheap $1 toothbrush for the time im travelling and discard).You can buy cheap head replacements off amazon too (they come in bulk for super cheap).
"
"
Bought this to replace the previous version with the dark blue handle that had three different speed settings, but the motor or battery started to die a slow death. This one only has one speed, but since my braces came off, it does the only function I need, a good cleaning.My oral health has been perfect since using the oral b brand sonic brushes with the precision clean heads. Would never go back to a regular toothbrush now except when I travel.

Pros:- Timer's very useful, made me pay more attention to how I brush- Brush motor is quite powerful- Induction charging is a neat feature for making the brush completely waterproof- Simple and intuitive to useCons:- Brush and charging cable are both too large to be travel friendly- Takes too long to charge fully (almost 2 days)Overall: Great brush! Would definitely recommend.

I bought this to replace a much older Oral B toothbrush that was beginning to wear out.  The old one was recommended by my dentist and I loved it.  So far, this newer brush performs as well as the older one, but with much better battery life (at least ten 4-minute brushings).
"
"
I like this toothbrush but for a couple minor things. The replacement heads are a bit pricey, the battery life isn't the best (I think I had to charge it every two days), and I found the vibration so powerful that I ultimately had to stop using it because it bothered my crown so much. Now, I have sensitive teeth - so this may not be the case for everyone. If you had sturdy teeth and minimal sensitivity, this may be the toothbrush for you. While I was using it, the dentist and dental hygienist did comment on how well it cleaned, particularly below the gum line.
"
"
I feel like my mouth is cleaner since I have this. Everyone should have one of those, it's SO superior to normal toothbrush! Only problem I have right now is the battery life, after a while the battery is noticeably oxidated and has to be recharged quite often.
"
"
I got this brush after doing a lot of research and am so pleased with my purchase. I have very sensitive gums so I was worried about it being too rough but the bristles are very soft and the motion isn't too aggressive. When I compare this to my old toothbrush (non-electric), I can tell you that my mouth feels so much cleaner now- and I was already doing a great job before. I feel like the toothbrush gets my teeth cleaner in half the time, and I have noticed less toothaches when eating sweets. Just awesome.
"
"
It's a good value for the price but if like me this is your first electric toothbrush be aware that the vibration will shake your jaw a lot. It does a good job with timing and cleaning but my jaw would get so sore when using it the first few weeks that I was going to give up on it. I built up enough tolerence now that it is ok. This may not be limited to this particular toothbrush.
"
"
Good electric toothbrush overall, but the feature that stop the brush every 30 seconds is actually annoying.  I also fear that it may reduce the product's durability. This is an example of companies offering features that actually diminish the value of the product.
"
"
Can't expect more compatible with all brush heads Oral B has to offer, not great for travelling though as the battery standby time is good 4 days the way I use i.e more than two minutes daily, as opposed to two minutes suggested from Oral-B.
"
"
My hygienist says that not only are my teeth in good shape but my gums as well - not bad for a senior citizen!  Two reasons I can think of.  The brush gets between the teeth to clean deep down.  The timer makes sure that I brush for 2 minutes.
"
"
This is a huge upgrade over the electric toothbrushes sold in drug stores, etc.  The feel alone is so much better but it makes way less noise and the 30 second intervals help ensure you're brushing all of your teeth for the right amount of time.  Plus it looks great with the black and white combination colour.
"
"
Feels like it is doing a decent job at cleaning. Brush head seemed large at first compared to my standard electric. Timer hesitation is nothing more than a gimmick and is very annoying, who needs to be told to move their toothbrush? Not a game changer, but an okay electric, at a decent price.
"
"
Works like a charm, such an instant relieve after you've brushed your teeth with this toothbrush, you can really feel the difference compared to any other regular brush. A must have product for those who enjoy keeping their teeth clean!
"
"
This brush is quite powerful and the battery lasts a long time on a single charge. The timer function is helpful and motivates you to brush for the recommended full two minutes. Doesn't come with a travelling case if you're looking to travel with it -- will have to purchase one or MacGyver something.
"
"
Im never going back to a manual toothrbsuh. Although it is pretty pricey, its worth the ammouunt of cavities you avoid! After the first use I ran my tongue over my teeth and they felt sooooo clean. However I wish there was a way to slow down the brushing, its a bit fast for me. Also theres a learning curve so after a 3 day period its easier. I like it tho!
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush for the price. I have always been interested in the market for an electric toothbrush, and this model is great for the novice. Simple to use, yet powerful to get your teeth squeaky clean. If you're skeptical of which one to buy, I definitely recommend the Oral-B Pro 1000. Cannot beat the price/value you get with this product.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush. Cleans well, but it gets a bit annoying with the pressure detection where it basically stops when you put too much pressure. It was definitely an adaptation from a manual brush but I definitely feel cleaner with this thing. Much easier to clean the back teeth more effectively, and it works pretty well on the tongue too!
"
"
I've had this tooth brush for a few years now and it's great. Use it twice a day and replace the head monthly. Does need to stay plugged in or battery goes dead sooner than later.The Oral-B is relatively cheap and gives you just what you need and that's it. I don't need all these different settings, fittings or Wi-Fi updates with my toothbrush. Just on and off, Listerine and some floss gets the job done.
"
"
Item was as described. The battery life is quite good. It does take a bit long to charge, however, it lasts long. The brushing motion feels good on the teeth, not too rough. I much prefer this toothbrush to a regular brush.
"
"
So far so good with this item. The first charge is only a week old, but the toothbrush is cleaning wonderfully, and doesn't bother the gums or cause any bleeding. The clean is much better than with a regular bristle brush
"
"
Love it Love Love it! Did i mentioned i love it?
"
"
Excellent!! Nous sommes 3 à l’utiliser. Nous faisons que changer la tête chaque fois. La batterie a une très bonne autonomie. J’adore la fonction de calcul de temps par quart de bouche. Je ne regrette pas dutout cet achat. Peut-être un peu bruyante si je veux absolument lui trouver un defaut!!
"
"
Not sure if it is TOO powerful, it is definitely more powerful then my last sonic toothbrush. Will look into buying a softer head for it. wouldn't recommend if this is your first power toothbrush, it might turn you off it. Leaves your teeth extremely clean though!
"
"
The toothbrush is so noisy, just like driving a old car.  The model is outdated. Short battery life and not comfortable when using.  I don’t recommend this product.  Better to spend little more money to buy sonicare.
"
"
My family and my dentist all raved about the electric toothbrushes, but I was stubborn and didn't want to spend the money, I wish I'd caved sooner. I finally gave in due to environmental problems of the amount of waste toothbrushes cause with the electric toothbrushes at the moment being more environmentally friendly.Pros:- teeth feel cleaner than ever- doesn't feel like i'm at dentist when I'm using it (what I thought it would feel like)- more environmentally friendly than non-electricCons:- my only con is that I wish that the heads you purchase for the toothbrush were recyclable. I would love to see Oral-B become one of the first companies to market such an item
"
"
This tooth brush is awesome. I was always convinced that an electric brush was the ""lazy way out"" but boy have I changed my mind. It really does clean much much better than a manual tooth brush, my teeth feel dentist clean everytime and I can noticeably feel the plaque removal. Very glad i switched.
"
"
I ordered this after receiving an email for a discount. It took a while to get here since they were sold out but once it got here it was worth it. I’ve been using it for 2 months now and I don’t know how I ever brushed my teeth before. My gums are sensitive and this doesn’t agitate them.
"
"
One of the best things I ordered from Amazon. There is such a difference between this and a manual toothbrush (and even from battery operated toothbrushes). Within 3 days, I noticed a significant difference. I ended up buying another one as a gift for the wife, it's that good. (Who would have thought of gifting toothbrushes, lol).
"
"
very good toothbrush, rechargeable is def the way to go.  Ease into the use tho, the starting brushhead is very stiff and will beat you gums up if you go cold turkey on your old toothbrush, ie, don't start with the 2min full on, try a combination of 30sec or so, finishing off with your old brush.  Another thing I noticed, is how much toothpaste I've been wasting, only needs a dime-size, not that inch-long line for the old toothbrush.
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush, I have very sensitive gums but have used it many times with no issue. The timer is well appreciated and the interchangeable heads is a great bonus, not to mention the whitening of the bristles with use to show wear, taking the guess work out of the useful life of a head.10/10 would buy more heads for.
"
"
I only get about 26 minutes out of this internal battery in this unit befor the red charging light comes on once I turn it off. I brush 2 times a day on averange for 2 1/2 minutes per brushing, that only guarantees 5 days on a change. So can't go on camping trips for more then 5 days without bringing a second unit or a battery pack to charge it up some.The unit is fairly quiet BUT, the brush head is very loud.The good, does a good job cleaning your teeth at least.
"
"
I REALLY love my new toothbrush! I've been using it for 3 months now and I can't believe I waited so long before taking the plunge and buying an electric toothbrush. Really good value for the money, no gimmicky features you won't use and leaves your teeth with a perfectly clean sensation.
"
"
Bon produit.Si vous voulez éviter le dentiste, un très bon achat.Pas beaucoup de fonction, elle brosse très bien, elle vibre quand ça fait 2 min.J’ai pas besoin d’avoir un GPS dans ma bouche.Donc, léger , brosse très bien comme on le souhaite pour une brosse électrique.Chez Oral-b meilleur rapport qualité vs prix.
"
"
simple to use , teeth feel super clean after use lasts well over 1 week between charges . not much more you can ask for in a toothbrush  . i can reccomend it  works well not to expensive trusted brand
"
"
My wife likes hers too... It's Like Running a Supercharged V8 In Your Mouth ! Charges up just fine and runs powerfully compared to my 8 year old unit. Very easy to hold. I'm pleased with this purchase.
"
"
After using a manual toothbrush all my life, this was quite a step up. When I finish brushing, there's a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth are (you can feel the difference) I'm very impressed with this brush.Thanks
"
"
The last one I bought wasn't the same model but same company. It still work fine except that the look is kind of old as I used many time for almost 15 years. The battery and motor still work fine.
"
"
Well, I purchased a pro 8000 and this one at the same time and well let me tell you this one is better since it worth the money you pay! the pressure sensor is a joke! it does not work at all...
"
"
Love It! Works Great and feels a lot cleaner after brushing my teeth. I have used it only for a few days  and loving it. My gums is not use to it but is now adjusting as it hurts at first maybe because of me putting so much pressure on it while brushing. I will but again
"
"
The battery on my old, VERY well-used toothbrush (plak control ultra in PINK) finally gave out this week so I started searching for a replacement brush. After using this type of brush I will never go back to traditional manual brushes - they just don't get into the nooks and crannies well enough.I placed my order at 11am Feb. 25th and my new brush was in my hands the very next morning - and I never pay extra for ""faster"" shipping! After charging this baby up I'm thoroughly enjoying brushing my teeth again, and the bonus is that it's quieter than the last one. Couldn't be happier!
"
"
Im extremely disappointed in this product. After three months of use the charger quit. I contacted the company and a lady told me there was no warranty. She gave me a part number and a we site to get a new one. The number she gave me was wrong and fortunately i caught it. I found the right product and ordered it only to find out after i ordered that there was huge shipping charges added later. The charger ended up costing me more than the whole unit combined. Not happy.
"
"
Works great but does sound loud & feels strong vibration. The pressure sensitivity does work if you push too hard.I only use it once a day. Not comfortable  using it for every brushing.  Worried it may be too aggressive.But works like it states.
"
"
What can I say.  It works.  Weird thing is that every unit I have will stall for 1/4 second after about 20 seconds of brushing.  Is that some sort of timer to tell me how long I am brushing?  I didn't bother with the instructions.  Battery needs a recharge maybe every week or so brushing twice a day.

Have only used OralB electric toothbrushes, and have always had great results at the dentist (like a major drop in plaque, to almost none).  New smaller base makes it easier to travel with when gone for more than a week, otherwise I only bring the brush.
"
"
I bought the Oral B Pro 1000 toothbrush based on the fact I had an Oral B brush.  This toothbrush is so much more powerful than my old one.  I like the larger brush head.  It does an amazing job cleaning my teeth.  I would recommend this brush.
"
"
I'm happy with my Oral B I'm not sure about setting up the signals for different times of brushing or is that automatically I'm not sure but yeah I'm happy with its powerful it's quiet I'm waiting for it to completely charge it keeps on flashing green I'm not sure why anyways I'm happy with the product it's October 11th was she in the difference in a month or two.
"
"
I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for approximately 15 years before it died. As I was quite satisfied with the performance of that brush, I decided to stick with the brand for my replacement. This electric toothbrush does not disappoint! I find it more powerful and I'm getting a much better clean with less effort. The timer function is great and the design is sleek and clean, with a smaller base than my older model. I would definitely recommend!
"
"
Excellent product with great battery life! Does what it's supposed to do i.e. the brushing... would recommend to anyone who is a newbie for electronic toothbrushes. Bought it on black Friday so got an excellent product with great value for money.Tip: if you are a couple buy one device and two tooth brushes. Can interchange the brushes on the same device.
"
"
It’s good but too hard bristles. I was using sonic before and I liked it better. Plus sonic stops at two minutes and if you want to extend the time, you switch it on again. This one does not stop at two minutes but just makes it slower
"
"
Fonctionne très bien. Il y manque qu un case pour le voyage car pas pratique ( hygiène ). Pour le reste parfait. Ils auraient pu en fournir un en plastique pour dépanner !
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I love it. My teeth seem very clean and whiter than usualand my head is not vibrated abnormally! There are no bells or whistles on this model; no 30 second beeper, no slower or faster mode, etc. If you are looking for extra features, then model up.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush. I'm terribly missing a timer feature. It's not very good for traveling though, because when I take the head part off, it doesn't same much time and I couldn't find appropriate box to put the whole thing in to not damage the brush
"
"
I love this toothbrush! My old Oral B electric lasted a lot of years so it’s retirement was due. This new one is better because it gives me a warning at 30 seconds and also at 2 minutes to ensure I brush my teeth thoroughly! Takes the guess work out of oral hygiene.
"
"
Tried others in the past and will only use Oral-B now.  Had my last Oral-B for a long time so really happy with its durability and when this one is done I will buy the same one again.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush. The built in timer is my favourite thing. Recommended by my dentist. Best bang for the buck. Don't waste your time with really expensive electronic toothbrushes as this has everything you need!
"
"
Shipment was delayed and lost. Until I write to Amazon asking for shipment update, Amazon placed with a replacement order and I got the shipment in a couple days after that.  Oral B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is the best one. I am happy with it and recommend for everyone who loves powered toothbrush.
"
"
This product is great for everyday use. I have to charge it about once every 4 days or so but it really cleans your teeth well. I find that when the battery life starts to flash, you still have about 1 good use in before it dies. overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.
"
"
I bought this as a replacement for my 20 year old oral b. I love it... I really like the 30 sec reminder to go to another area for brushing. Its louder than my old one but its not a big deal.
"
"
This toothbrush does an excellent job.  My partner recently purchased an electric toothbrush and after trying his with a different brush of course I decided to purchase one of my own. After some research, I decided to get Oral B 1000, the price was affordable and it was adaptable for a variety of brushes and now my husband uses mine, of course with a different brush as I had purchased a package of brushes. We're pretty happy with my choice.
"
"
Why did I wait so long to get an electric toothbrush I have no idea!!!!  Love having it.  It has a 30 second timer to remind you to move to the next section of your mouth.  Very helpful.
"
"
-The vibration is way too strong for sensitive gums...and it's sooo loud!! I've always had oral b brushes, I'm really disappointed with this one.-False claims:1)""Senses when you brush too hard with pressure sensor"" doesn't exist on this toothbrush!!2)""In-handle timer pulses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch areas of the mouth"" doesn't exist on this toothbrush!!
"
"
It’s been a little over a month since receiving this product and it’s  my second time charging this electric toothbrush on the docking station it was provided with and now  it does not work anymore.  I would not recommend as it’s just a waste of money 💲I only give it two star rating as the shipping was quick
"
"
Doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the expensive options have (ie. bluetooth, timers etc.) but it has a sensor that stops the toothbrush from spinning if you're applying too much pressure which is the biggest plus for me as I was wrecking my gums using a manual brush before.  Haven't tested how long a charge works since I put it on the charger every night but so far no complaints and I am very satisfied.  Easy enough to find generic brand heads if you don't need any specialized options.
"
"
Dont buy this product - The Battery dies in 2/3 months or after the warrantyI had it exchanged and the second unit battery died too.I wont buy this one again, will try something different.
"
"
It's a better brushing experience, it just does a better job than you can do with a manual toothbrush.  The only con is it is a bit loud and would be nice if it came with a travel case but for the price it's well worth it.
"
"
Its good for the price.. not a lot of functions but its a toothbrush...I know it does does the job better than my manual that's for sure.Merci,
"
"
I read other reviews with negatives about how loud this is.  It's not.  I am unsure how quiet people want it, but it is just fine.  Teeth feel great after using this brush.
"
"
Needed a new electric toothbrush and came across this one.Love the new features it has compared to my old one, easy to use, compact and the battery lasts a lot longer!Thinking about purchasing one for my husband now!
"
"
Bought this toothbrush back in December. Currently using it as my daily tooth brush. This toothbrush is definitely an upgrade from my old standerd toothbrush and it seems to be doing a better job than my old toothbrush use to do. My teeth seem to be whiter and brighter.1 Negative. Charging the toothbrush is a pain in the butt, but it's worth it.
"
"
Great toothbrush, decided to buy an electric toothbrush and went with amazons recommendation. dont think ill ever go back to a manual toothbrush, it leaves teeth feeling smoother and smile slowly got whiter
"
"
I can't believe how noisy the 1000 is, average of 68 decibels. That's the same as a regular conversation. Not what I want before bed.The package states the bristles are soft, they are not anywhere near what my dentist gives me as a soft toothbrush.Other than these two issues, I would say the product is good. I would rather upgrade to a better model or go back to my Sonic
"
"
Great toothbrush! I love the timer function and my mouth feels very clean! Brush replacements are reasonably priced and i enjoy using this! Great value for your money!
"
"
Got this on sale and it's working as well as I had hoped. I could do without the 30 second buzzing feature, as it makes me feel like I have to rush.. but I suppose it helps make sure I'm not brushing for too long. It's easy to clean and take apart and holds a charge really well.
"
"
I'm loving my new electric toothbrush. It makes your teeth feel really clean and the timer function helps you know how long you need to brush. I love it!
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and it works great. The battery lasts for a very long time, and the motor produces enough power to really clean your teeth. I've definitely noticed a change in the color of my teeth since i started using this 6 months ago. The only con is that it can be messy, and you have to clean the base quite often unless you like having blue gunk on it.
"
"
Love the toothbrush and would buy again.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found that it needs to be recharged after two days.  To fully recharge  takes up to 12 hours.  Thank You
"
"
My first time purchasing an ""expensive"" electric toothbrush. I like this brush a lot. The small head makes it easy to maneuver and the 30 second pulses reminder really helps you with timing. No complaints!
"
"
She likes it a lot, I have a different model but does basically the same thing, say goodbye to those fuzzy slippers on your teeth, and say hello to those pearls
"
"
I’ve been using these brushes for 15 years now. Got it recently, and so far batteries lasting at least a week. I was a little worried that it was too strong but then I changed the brush head that came with it for the Percision clean brush head (softer) and now it’s just perfect
"
"
Great toothbrush, although it is very loud and a bit too crazy fast when it spins but I'm sure it's doing a great job cleaning my teeth at the same time.
"
"
I love brushing my teeth now?This makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean, it is so quick and easy to use and clean, and I can't imagine going back to a regular toothbrush now! I used to think electric toothbrushes were a gimmicky money grab, but... well, I'm converted.
"
"
Bought this as a wanted xmas gift for my 8 years old. No hassles to brush his anymore. I have ordered replacement heads so I can use it also. Cleans teeth very well. I haven't seen his teeth so clean after he's brushed unless I have done it myself, but this little machine makes his mouth look fresh from the dentist.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and my teeth fee 10X cleaner. Since using my dentist also noticed improvements in less plaque.Only downside is the base gets “scum” build up from salvia/water dripping through. I clean my holder every 2 days but wish it had a better drain system.
"
"
My wife and I both have one of these and they work great!  Very easy to use, never have battery issues and definitely prefer it over non electric store bought tooth brushes.
"
"
The timer is useful. I do not love electric toothbrushes at the best of times, but this is a reasonable volume and holds its charge well. My husband finds his impossible to keep clean, but if you rinse it well after every use you should be fine.
"
"
The motor is too weak, I like the weight, size and is black, but is the motor is not powerful enough, I feel I need to spend more time on each teeth, not recommended.
"
"
Great toothbrush, I know its the base model so its a bit louder than the other models. But my teeth have never felt so clean and it definitely gives the best plaque removal. Slim enough to travel with or pack away.
"
"
Super nice brush! My siblings got the Oral B 7000, but after using this one I feel like its more bang for the buck than the 7000. Makes brushing fun and something to look forward to and the timing system helps you keep an even brush to each mouth quadrant.
"
"
I got this Myself but then my girlfriend took it because I wanted the Oral-B 7000 I think it’s a really good toothbrush for people who have never had any other electric toothbrush it’s pretty excellent way better than manual and Oral-B is making top-of-the-line stuff so I would I would if you want the cheap brand I would invest into this
"
"
Works wellBattery life is greatEasy to useCharges quicklyWill get mouldy under the head due to moisture leakage
"
"
This is a great tooth brush, has alot of power to it for my teeth. The vibration is heavy, the batter power indent know because I always have it plugged in.
"
"
My dentist said I had gingivitis and that I should try using an electric toothbrush as it does a better job of cleaning around the gumline. Within a month, I noticed drastic improvements and my teeth feel much cleaner and it seems like I no longer have gingivitis because my gums are no longer super red or bleeding!
"
"
Great toothbrush. Head is a bit large to reach my wisdom teeth (yes I still have all 4) but no different than a regular brush.Only disadvantage is when you place it back on the charge station, after a few days of it drying off (and dripping to the base) it can get sticky ... simple wipe with water fixes it. Not a big issue.
"
"
Best toothbrush I have ever purchased.... it's definitely wOrth the money and you can really tell the difference coming from a.low priced electric toothbrush or standard tooth brush
"
"
It's a good toothbrush and I am pretty impressed with its performance.Two things which are bothering me a bit :1. There is no pressure sensor in this toothbrush, as it was advertised in its description2. The toothbrush head which you will receive in the box has hard bristles and may cause bleeding in gums. Mine are sensitive though. For better results, you need to pay extra for good quality brush heads with soft bristles.
"
"
The toothbrush has long-lasting battery life and feels good after a fresh charge. Although, the brush does stutter every now and then and happens often but only lasts 2-3 seconds. Overall a great investment and I'm very happy with the product and recommend it to anyone whos looking to buy an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Lol a little aggressive at first bc I was used to using a manual brush but I really love this toothbrush! The head on it is perfect for getting under my retainer wire and cleaning those pearly whites!
"
"
bought this for our son and he likes it better then a manual toothbrush and he likes the color of it hopefully he has it for some time .
"
"
Works good! Teeth feel very clean and polished just like I got back from dentist. This one pulses as you go to tell you to move to next row of teeth.
"
"
I have been using it for some time and it has worked very well. No issues yet.  I like the 30 second pulse notice, so you can switch to the 1/4 of your mouth.
"
"
I purchased this end of Nov 2019 and it was working fine until one day (a little more than 3 months later), after charging, it just no longer works. The charging light will still light up but the toothbrush itself does not function anymore. After reading other reviews, this seem to happen often. Definitely not worth the price.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is great and does a really good job at cleaning, especially around the teeth and gum line. My only issue with this toothbrush is that the timer does not work at all. It just stays on. Not a major issue, but felt like I should mention it. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a bit pricey and the timer is a small issue.
"
"
I had to replace my Oral B that was at least 10 or 15 years old. This one works beautifully, nice and strong battery and my teeth feel amazing!
"
"
Very nice! Really impressed with this toothbrush! Does a great job and looks nice too! My teeth are already whiter and brighter in less than a week. Would definitely buy again!
"
"
My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush and I can already feel the difference! We'll wait and see if it improves my next check up but my guns are already feeling better sounds using it
"
"
Purchased couple of these for my children a very long time ago (well over a year or two) and they are abused like children tend to do with things, but still working just like new.
"
"
We bought this as a birthday gift for our grandson and so we haven't opened it.  I do have to say however, that my husband and I have had two Oral-B electric toothbrushes and they have been excellent.  So we are expecting that this one will be great too.
"
"
It’s working very well, I don’t like the plastic part of the  handle, I find it slippery, the rubber part is good. They could’ve done a better job on the handle.
"
"
I've returned to the dentist's office twice since buying this tooth brush. Both visit were problem-free. The hygenist tells me ""Great job!"". So it must be good.
"
"
So far so good. Had almost the same one for 15 years. Lithium power is better than the old NiMH ones. I would have preferred the option of a docking system like my old one where I can wall mount it and store things along with the power unit.
"
"
Ok but motor does power down and drag when any pressure applied between brush head and tooth, when your tring to clean something out from between teeth
"
"
Really annoying. It can be used only for 2 mins even though it is being plugged in 24/7. Basically only one person can use the brush in the morning.  For the other family members, we all have to buy separate electric tooth brush? Really? Very upset with the buy. They should recall this product.
"
"
First time switching from manual to electric tooth brush. Once I got used to the sensation, I really liked using this over my old toothbrush. It's a lot more lightweight than I expected, and it leaves a fairly small footprint on the bathroom counter with its charging stand. No complaints at all really. The description accurately describes what you're getting. Would definitely recommend.
"
"
There are kids versions of electric toothbrushes but really when their first teeth fall out they have adult teeth and should be brushing well. This electric brush helps kids brush each tooth one at a time and much better than a manual or children's back and forth style electric. Light enough for a 8 year old to handle.
"
"
Timer function ?? My dentist was very pleased with my last checkup and I attribute it, in part, to the use of this toothbrush.
"
"
Makes brushing allot easier and is absolutely worth it. If you have never used electrics this powerful I would recommend starting with softer heads.

Excellent product. I was hesitant about investing in an electric toothbrush but I’m so glad I did.The timer function is awesome. And I was surprised that the standard toothbrush head it comes with works well for me, even though I have sensitive teeth. Very happy with this.
"
"
Works, as advertised except the battery, died after 10 uses when it's advertised to work for 20 uses. I need it to work for a longer period of time in order to travel.
"
"
I am not the kind of person to spend a lot of money on a toothbrush. This one is absolutly worth it if you're looking for a toothbrush that is not expansive while sill doing what a toothbrush is supposed to do, no more no less. If you're still using a manuel toothbrush, you'll feel a big change immediately after the first brush with this one. It really does remove plaque and whitens teeth. Worth it.
"
"
I strongly recommend you only buy an electric toothbrush with a lithium battery. No memory effect and much more brushes per charge. I bought this to replace a working Oral-B with a fading nicad battery. One of the least expensive but it gets the job done.
"
"
It performs very well, although this product can go even cheaper. I felt it is a bit expensive. The brush head is really thick compares to other brushes. The weight of the machine is very light. Therefore, this is a good product!
"
"
Bought this on sale. Months later I am still happy with this brush. Has a 30 second buz that goes off to let you know you can move to the next section to clean if you want to use it. Battery lasts a long time before needing a charge and is usually fully charged by next use.
"
"
Great tooth brush I had an older model that was wearing out, so I expected the same but oral b really improved the motor and is much better than the 12 year old brush I was using. I would recommend this to anyone. After using it I feel I was just at the dentist.
"
"
Bought it to replace my old unit which died after a decade. Price was low, reviews so-so. For me the unit works well. Recommend recharging after each use as it does take a long time to charge.
"
"
These features never work --- ""A helpful on‐handle timer buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know when it’s time to focus on brushing the next quadrant of your mouth. The brush also alerts you when you have brushed for the dentist‐recommended time of 2 minutes.""
"
"
Cleanest my teeth have ever felt, but the bush heads themselves get all gummed up with goop if you are not meticulous with the clean up..... so two minutes to brush up and two minutes to clean up. Other than that GREAT!
"
"
The first time I bought this toothbrush 5 years ago, the battery would last a week before needing to be charged. The latest version of this toothbrush has a terrible battery. It last at most 3 days and starts to slow down significantly after just a day. When it works, it does an excellent job brushing your teeth. Made a huge difference to my gums.
"
"
Ordered this product specifically as I am a fan of Oral B products.  Took a long time to charge at first (22hours).  Will be interesting to see how long the charge lasts and how long the re-charge takes.
"
"
Saved a ton by buying it on Amazon prime day!  It’s a great tooth brush, good battery life, also ordered more heads from amazon too!  Way cheaper.
"
"
Feels wierd at first but love it.  Makes my teeth feel really clean.  Would like to have seen a container to snap over the bristles, but can remedy that by buying one at my local dollar store.  Nice look and weight.
"
"
Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh after use. Timer function is incredibly useful, even when I use a regular tooth brush now I feel like I'm brushing for longer. No complaints!
"
"
Braun is the one i am using for last 16 years. I have used about three different heads in 16 years. I don't see i will ever go back.Also, i got my rebate from P&G on this purchase. These things last for long time. Brush heads, in only buy genuine in market so i can stay good with this one.
"
"
I liked the speed of this model as well as the cross action brush head.  I love the timer function which lets you know when it's time to switch sides for a better cleaning and the battery life is long, I've only had to charge it twice since I received it and that's using it twice a day.
"
"
This unit is not worth purchasing! The batter had trouble charging for the beginning, it would slow down in uses and after two weeks the unit will not charge at all. Don't waste your money.
"
"
Works but makes a lot if noise and appears aggressive on the teeth. I've bought oral b before and none of them operated like this. Disappointed
"
"
A full charge lasts me for 1.5 weeks without needing to recharge. Making the switch from a regular old toothbrush to and electric toothbrush I can’t imagine going back. My dentist typically tells me to floss more and ever since I started using I haven’t gotten that comment. Like it so much I ended up buying one for each one of my family member.
"
"
Don't like this thing at all. Threw it out, brushes get nasty fast, expensive replacements. Bought a sonicare works way better
"
"
Simple yet effective. I did a search on an product review website called Wirecutter and they selected the Oral B-Pro 1000 as they best toothbrush and offered the most value. In addition,  Amazon also has the best price!
"
"
Good product for the price but I find that it needs charging often like every 2 days.I had other Oral B before and it seems that I didn't charge the toothbrush that often for the same daily usage.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Easy to use and holds the charge.  Cleans teeth and gum area just like going to the dentist.  Love it
"
"
Battery does not last long, needs recharging every 3-4 days, after use by two people twice a day.Should last longer!
"
"
I previously bought a philips essence toothbrush and was NOT happy with it so bought this one instead. It is AMAZING. I highly recommend it. You can immediately feel that it has done a good job.
"
"
Excellent unit, my previous one lasted over 10 years
"
"
Very impressed with this toothbrush..1st time user of a electric ...65 years old and should of bought this brush years ago. Brush once a day, I should do more.
"
"
My  teeth and gums feel so clean after using this. Feels like it is giving my gums a massage. I like how it automatically stops turning if you apply too much pressure. My teethe and health are going to benefit from this investment.
"
"
Fantastic tooth brush! The color is great!
"
"
Bought for Christmas gifts. My wife and I have these and they work great. Teeth always feel clean.
"
"
Charger stopped working after 3 weeks...must have been faulty.For the list price its expensive...you can get two for this price elsewhere...
"
"
Great brush! Don't find the vibrations too crazy for my teeth or gums. Glad I made the switch from manual to this electric toothbrush. I also find the toothbrush head a great size for teeth. The larger heads seem as they won't clean the individual tooth as intensively.
"
"
Very good and the time function lets you know when you can change the sides. It is also light weight as well.
"
"
Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He keeps telling me it’s the best!
"
"
I am very happy with my purchase. It is replacement. It is more powerful than the previous model. I can really feel the difference. It will be confirmed at the teeth cleaning.
"
"
this is a great unit,  timer function is great, battery life lasts at least a week,  does an amazing job,  feels like you just left the dentist.
"
"
After charging the battery for a long time, I pressed the button for about 30 seconds, the machine stopped working. There was only a moaning hum, not working at all. Very disappointed. I think I have to return it if it doesn't get better. Out of mood with Oral b products.
"
"
I use it every day. The only thing is for the price of it they should inclue a couple different brushes.
"
"
Bought as a gift. Came quickly and was well received. The giftee loves it and says it works great.
"
"
great product, battery charging wireless---> less concern for electronic shock. charged overnight and used very well with strong rotation.
"
"
Great price and so far has worked great. This is the first electric Toothbrush I've owned and it's weight and feel of quality was better than I was expecting. I can honestly tell the difference, my teeth are cleaner and whiter already versus the manual brushes I have always used.
"
"
Had a sonic unit before this one, after 8 years it dies.  I don't think this one, Sounds like it's using marbles to brush my teeth.  Just bought a new Sonic unit to replace this after less than 30 days.
"
"
This toothbrush is nice, but it won't turn on anymore and I've only had it since March 1st. It seems to charge fine, but nothing happens when I press the power button now. Return window closed a week ago... Definitely not worth the money if this is the norm.
"
"
comparing with normal toothbrush this is way better, can't tell about other brand/kind.Did not try to travel with it.
"
"
This tooth brush does not hold a charge. Feels like its going to die out after 60 seconds. I've had many oral b power brushes never one as terrible as this one. I do not recommend buying this model
"
"
Works great, love the timer. And it feels like ive gone to the dentist every time i use it
"
"
The pulse every 30 seconds to let you know to change areas is a great feature that my previous electric toothbrush didn't have. Stays charged for about a week and I haven't noticed a drop in performance throughout that week. The large brush head is something else I liked. Brush heads are much cheaper for this model than my other toothbrush. Unfortunately 8 or 9 hours isn't enough to reach a full charge. Altogether a great product, much better than my previous that costed more.
"
"
Great product and works well. It's been really reliable and the charge lasts quite awhile. The price was good.
"
"
Takes around 12-14 hours or more to get a full charge. That is my only drawback. Perfect toothbrush!
"
"
Great brush. My husband really feels the difference in clean using this. The 20 second timer helps keep track of where you're brushing. It's functional and compact. The charging base doesn't take up much room.
"
"
J aime vraiment! C est vrai que les dents sont bcp plus propres. La seule option qui manque est le détecteur de pression, mais il faut juste penser à laisser la brosse à dent travailler seule mais mettre de pression. Go for it
"
"
It took a bit of getting used to since I was pressing the brush too hard against my teeth but now I like it.  No problems.  Haven't used the timer function very often.
"
"
Love this toothbrush .... lots of power , will get any bits of food trap in your teeth or gums . Also notice how clean it makes your teeth as well . The battery life is super long before needing to charge it again.
"
"
Ça semble un bon produit! Acheté pour donner en cadeau de noël donc pas encore utilisé!
"
"
LOVE this toothbrush! I was debating going for a higher end one but this one does everything I need it to. Two pulses and you know to switch quadrants, 4 pulses and you've brushed for 2 minutes.Gives an amazing clean mouth feeling!!
"
"
About 3 months after I bought it, it started to smell burnt. No amount of type of cleaning can get the smell out, so I wonder if it is a motor issue.
"
"
This toothbrush really rattles and shakes the whole handle and everything.  I've had other brands where the head vibrated very fast but was quiet and the whole thing did not rattle.  Would not buy again.
"
"
I finally switched to an electric toothbrush and I'm not going back. Great price and exactly what I needed
"
"
Jusqu’à maintenant je ne suis pas déçu! Acheté depuis quelques mois et le produit fonctionne très bien
"
"
So a thing with this toothbrush is that you have to push it in very hard into the charging port otherwise it will only give bursts of charge to the toothbrush which will shortcircuit it. It’s a really crappy design flaw really and I wish I could return this for a new one...
"
"
I replaced my old Oral B Pro when the battery faded after many years of service.  This new Oral B Pro 1000 can last a week (2 to 3 times daily use).  It cleans very well and I haven't had any issues with it for the past few weeks.
"
"
Très satisfaite de l'achat de ma première brosse à dent électrique.. Parfait pour débutant.. Procure un nettoyage impeccable!
"
"
Does exactly what it says. Been using it for slightly over a month and think it's one of the best automatic brushes I've used.
"
"
Took a while to charge, but all in all the product does what I expected.  It could use a pointed brush to complete the set of brushes which I also ordered.
"
"
Pour ce prix j'ai vraiment limpression que ma bouche est beaucoup plus propre qune brosse a dent electrique jetable
"
"
I had to replace my Oral-B electric toothbrush recently after using it for many years. They are excellent quality and last for a long time. Happy Amazon delivered it in no time at all. I missed it for even a few days.
"
"
Très efficace cette brosse à dents électrique.  Très satisfait de ma commande.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. I like the timer function - it makes brushing my teeth seem to take less time. Really powerful toothbrush, you dont need to apply any pressure really.
"
"
Works great and your teeth feel even better. Battery life is roughly a week brushing twice a day. Maybe less. Bought a second one for a gift
"
"
Extremely loud and horrible vibration on my teeth while cleaning.. I can barely stand it even with the slightest pressure. I’m sure regular use would lead to receding gums. Expensive for what it is... my boyfriend bought a less expensive which was far better.
"
"
Works really well.  The toothbrush indicates when to move on to the next area.  Lets you know when 2 minutes is up.
"
"
First electric toothbrush so not much to compare to, however this device is way to loud and feels clunky. The brush head is too wide and brushes my gums causing them to bleed every time. For 39.99 (Black Friday) you can’t go wrong but personally speaking I would’ve opted for something a little more expensive for the better quality
"
"
After extensive research, it turns our this toothbrush looked like the best bang for my bucks. After several weeks giving it a test drive, I must say it does the job consistantly with great results. Other Oral-B will basically do the same things, with more bells and whisles, but for a steeper price.
"
"
Inductive Charging is nice. Replacement heads are expensive, so I will try the OEM heads.
"
"
I do not think these are worth the price they are able to charge but I am very pleased with the results as the plaque between my teeth has completely gone.
"
"
The mechanism works well for cleaning and the timer is really nice for taking the guesswork out of spending an equal amount of time in each quadrant.Electric >>>> Manual toothbrushes all day
"
"
Shipping rapide. Produit impeccable que j'ai réussi à payer 40% moins cher au black Friday.
"
"
Great toothbrush! Tàkes a little getting used to in the beginning! Works great otherwise!
"
"
Has great power compared to the disposable battery version. Worth the price. I wish I could turn the timer off.
"
"
tres bon achat,  on ne peut plus s en passer, la pile dure 7 jours, ensuite, on le replace quelques heures sur la charge et c est reparti pour une autre semaine ;)
"
"
she likes it so far.. bought for her because she brushes her teeth too hard and thus is slowly getting receding gumline
"
"
Not quite sure this has a timer. Would not use timer anýway.Battery seems to lose power quickly...
"
"
Item arrived and is charging on the fourth day now, still blinking and cannot turn on since its still charging. Hope this is a defect that can be fixed
"
"
Very disappointed in this product. The toothbrush is advertised as having ""the pressure sensor stops the pulsation movement if you brush too hard"", NO such function exists. You can press as hard as you can and the pulsation will not stop. DO NOT buy this product if you're buying for the pressure sensor claim.
"
"
I like that it is light weight and less bulky than other brush heads.
"
"
Seems to do the trick. Bought for my boyfriend  he has no complaints.
"
"
Gives you a similar clean feeling as a visit to the dental hygienist. Don’t need all the bells and whistles of the higher models.
"
"
Great toothbrush and lasts a long time. I don't have to constantly charge the battery.  Also it's easy to carry around if you want to travel with it. Does not take up a lot of space in the bathroom.
"
"
My old electric toothbrush died and I ordered this one. Takes up very little room and works very well, very strong vibration
"
"
Dans un premier temps, on m’a envoyé une brosse défectueuse, je leur ai juste écrit pour leur expliquer l’anomalie; et on m’a renvoyé une autre avant même que je retourne la première. Et je suis vraiment satisfait.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush.. definitely enjoy the upgrade!The timer is so useful also...my teeth always feel squeaky clean after using it !
"
"
Used it in the past few days! works great! love it!Not sure about battery life but timer functions well! every 30s and after 2m it gives a vibration
"
"
Great upgrade from my older oral b. Much stronger and leaves my mouth feeling good and clean
"
"
Great toothbrush, powerful and cleans wellGreat pricing as well
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It vibrates to let you know 30 seconds is up and move to a different area. I like the fact you don't have to leave it on a chrger. I love the way my teeth and and mouth feel after brushing.
"
"
Works great after a couple of months. I'm glad I switched from a manual and this seems to be a competitive option, especially if you pick it up on sale.
"
"
This was a Christmas gift to myself. I love it. The timer function is helpful.
"
"
Works well... but either my battery is dead upon delivery or my charger is broken... barely lasts one tooth brush session before it dies !
"
"
Was just what I ordered. The only issue I had was the package contained a discount coupon for replacement brush heads. The coupon had an expiry date of July, 2018. My purchase date was October, 2019.
"
"
After several months of use the battery life is much better than it first was. Good quality product.
"
"
Fabulous.  My teeth feel cleaner already.  My first Braun lasted well past 10 years.  Like the new timing concept of 30s for each quadrant.  Great quality product.
"
"
battery died and will not recharge after just a couple of uses.
"
"
been using this product for a few years with aftermarket heads, works great
"
"
Works great cleaning wise. Green light kept flashing for days. Sent it back.
"
"
Love that it Let’s you know when you have reached two minutes!
"
"
Great Product ! The reason why I have given 4 Stars is because of Battery charge. The battery of this brush doesn’t hold charge for more than 3 days even if its fully charged.
"
"
I like this product .The brand says a lot - easy to clean, easy to charge , and easy to use . Wanting to buy more for my family
"
"
My teeth are super clean now and i use to have lots of problems with my teeth
"
"
Would not take a charge from day one.Threw away the box so cant return.Don't throw away your money buying from this seller.Get it locally so you can take it back if you have to.
"
"
Sleek look with the black. Always keep on the base so can’t speak to battery life while traveling. Clean feeling just like coming from the dentist
"
"
I was thinking of buying a more expensive one, but I have decided to buy it. I am happy about it. It gives a vibration every 30 seconds. It's a useful toothbrush
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Works great.  Mouth feels way cleaner after using this
"
"
AThis electric tooth brush works great and exactly as advertised. A great product and great value.
"
"
Timer is pretty quiet, battery lasts about a week, wish a travel case would of came with it. Good deal still.
"
"
Bon produit, le calcaire reste apparent sur le noir mais se lave bien
"
"
Ceci est ma première brosse à dent électrique. Après une semaine d'utilisation, je suis très satisfait du résultat. Mon seul regret est de ne pas en avoir acheté une avant.
"
"
I’m loving this toothbrush! It has a timer for each area of your mouth. Feels super clean after wards!
"
"
Teeth feel thoroughly clean and fresh after use. I would not see any reason to upgrade to a more expensive model. I find the timer slightly annoying but that’s just me. Overall a great purchase, would buy again and would recommend.
"
"
As advertised, with Prime was overnight shipped. Great to use.Much better than my older one. Wouldrecommend.
"
"
Its perfect! Got it for my sister because she loves clean teeth and this works so good!
"
"
La brosse ne s'arrête pas lorsqu'on appuie fortement .... une seule vitesse plutôt décue
"
"
Mon fils est très heureux..ENFIN une brosse à dent électrique !!
"
"
not worth the extra money. they talk bought features but are not included in the product. should have bought the cheaper model would have the same tooth brush and 30 dollars extra in my pocket.
"
"
A simple and effective brush that won't break the bank. Efficient and easy to use. Battery lasts a few days. If you're traveling on a short trip, you don't have to bring the charger.
"
"
Does the cleaning job pretty well. A bit noisy, but because it cleans well I gave it 5 stars!
"
"
This toothbrush has pretty much no features. It is as basic as it gets. I would not buy again.
"
"
I have only had this item for a short time so cannot say how well the battery lasts etc. I willtell you it cleans  much better then a manual brush. Love it!
"
"
It’s great. My teeth feel clean after using. The only negative thing is that it doesn’t come with a travel case or a cover which my previous toothbrush had.
"
"
This one is way better than our earlier model ones from 5 years ago. Huge performance improvement.
"
"
Makes brushing my teeth less of a hassle. No bells and whistles here, though I wish I could at least change the speed. I'm gonna need to get the soft bristle tips.
"
"
It's loud. Not ideal when trying to brush your teeth while someone is sleeping nearby.
"
"
Battery life isn't 40 minutes doesn't last 10 days. Probably about a week. Timer function doesn't reset and carrys over to your next brushing session. Hard to time for 2 minutes if you didn't finish the last one right on time.
"
"
Nothing really to comment on, it does what it sets out to do and does well at it. Overall no huge complaints.
"
"
Right after I bought this, I found that Costco is on sale for PRO 2000. It is even cheaper than this.
"
"
I've had my brush for a few days and quickly realized that even after charging it all day,  I can barely get 2 mins of brushing time.... So...  Not even close the advertised 7 days. Not sure what to do,  it's super limiting.
"
"
Feels like a dentist clean. This toothbrush is powerful af. So powerful it makes your eyeballs jiggle a lil, but it gives a good brushin for sure.
"
"
Love it, can't live without it. It helps oral hygiene
"
"
Battery lasts a long time between charges. Noticeably whiter teeth!
"
"
I had ordered 2 of them,  they are a great product
"
"
Je l’ai acheté en cadeau à ma mère et elle ne peut plus s’en passer tellement elle l’aime.
"
"
Best tooth brush I’ve ever bought ! Teeth feel Like I just left the dentist ! Amazing price ! Haven’t used the timer function. Battery has lasted over 7 days.
"
"
The twirly brush heads for plaque removing is so much more effective than my old Philips Sonicare. Two weeks in and I’m seeing a huge difference it’s making.
"
"
Been using this product for 3 weeks now and my gums feel well brushed and the round brush head reaches places a normal toothbrush can’t. Overall way better than standard toothbrush however battery life is tricky.
"
"
Love it, I have one myself and had bought these for my kids for their birthdays, they really like them also
"
"
Avait déjà une à la maison. Je l'ai acheté pour ma conjointe. 2 clients satisfaits.
"
"
This was my 1st electric toothbrush. I am very pleased with how well it cleans my teeth. My teeth feel professionally cleaned after each use. I also find I take more time brushing which is beneficial for my oral health.Will continue to always using an electric toothbrush.
"
"
I ordered a new brush and ut worked great for 20 day's. Suddenly the battery started to die so fast. I remember the first time I used it and it worked for like a week and now it hardly works for a day.
"
"
Très bon produit, brosse facile a trouver par la suite.
"
"
Everything was ok except it did not signal when 30 secs passed as it was advertised.
"
"
Awesome product, works extremely well, night and day when switching from a regular tooth brush.
"
"
It's an oral b, the best. Great price and does a great job.
"
"
Before this one i had the Vitality, but this one is so much better......I find it cleans alot better.....and the battery lasts longer...so it was work paying the little extra.
"
"
i love the product, using this kind of product O-B toothbrushes for many years but this one i got dose not charge fully always blinking, I am not happy about that, beside this I really like the product
"
"
Great quality for the price! Highly recommended!
"
"
I now brush mt teeth twice a day because of the speed, and convenience.  Like it a lot.
"
"
Je suis vraiment heureuse de mon achats, j’ai toujours pris soin de mes dents puis avec cette brosse à dent électrique mes dents sont impeccable 👌🏻
"
"
This is a great brush with lots of power and battery. I was disappointed when receiving the unit that there was only one head in the package, not even one spare.
"
"
The battery lasts a long time before having to recharge and is compatible with other chargers or brush heads....recommended
"
"
My daughter has braces and her orthodontist recommended using an electric toothbrush. I checked reviews of different ones available in the market and settled on this. I prefer this over the ones that need batteries. Purchased last month. So she's been using it daily twice a day for the past two weeks. No complaints. I feel the timer feature is excellent because earlier she used to just swish the toothbrush in her mouth when pressed for time!
"
"
I love this tooth brush. Has amazing power and I allowed it to fully charge (which killed me, but do it) so it lasts and lasts.
"
"
very powerful very reliable my dentist was impressed
"
"
Long battery life, charges quickly, easy to use
"
"
I like this one, as it only has one speed, similar to my older model, it's the only toothbrush I've used in 15 yrs.
"
"
I like it just fine. Having just received it I have no idea about its battery life and it isn't traveling right now.
"
"
I have used an Oral B for some time.  This is to replace my old one.  It is as expected. Service from Amazon was great as usual.
"
"
This toothbrush is great. I can feel a difference and see a difference in my teeth after I brush every time.
"
"
Love my new toothbrush, but doesn't seem to be holding a charge like it says on packaging, but still a great clean
"
"
Still going strong after a year and a half, love this toothbrush.  Charge lasts for about 2 weeks with 2 people using it (different brush attachments of course).  My dental hygienist noticed a difference after I got it, hate using a regular tooth brush now when I'm away from home.
"
"
Nicely buit. No contacts exposed. I mean, it's my first elecric toothbrush and I wouldn't ever switch back.
"
"
Love it no complaintsSo far clean well
"
"
It has a built in timer to tell you when to move to another side of your mouth. The battery life is great and it is also super light.
"
"
The charge lasts about a week and it is excellent at remove plaque build up.
"
"
Oral B Pro power toothbrush provides the best cleaning experience for teeth.  Excellent product.
"
"
We replaced our old Braun Electric Toothbrush which had lasted at least twelve years.  We are more than happy with this newer updated version.
"
"
Battery lasts really long, and the charger is small, good for traveling.
"
"
During every use it would stall out, and I do not use excessive pressure. Returned for refund
"
"
I like it except the bristle it fizzled out very fast
"
"
Never tried the timer. Good size for travel. Works as expected
"
"
Works fine. I  wish it didn't have the timing feature built in, let me brush my teeth at my own pace!
"
"
As I stated previously, I cannot rate this product as I am giving it s a Christmas Gift.
"
"
i went from a 13 dollar electric form mouthwash to thisand its a world of differencea whole new world
"
"
Perfect brush. Love the pressure sensors, to show when the user is brushing too hard.
"
"
Do not buy this product. I bought it a month ago and it worked fine with battery lasting for a week everytime. And then immediately it stopped working with just dead battery. Does anyone know how to get refund?
"
"
Immediately upon getting this item, I found that it would not hold a charge. Despite what the instructions say on how long a full charge should last you, the product I received would flash red after every brushing cycle, regardless of how long I left it to charge for.
"
"
It does what it is supposed to, great quality at a reasonable price. Thanks
"
"
De très bonne qualité. Je le recommande !
"
"
This  toothbrush makes my teeth feel so much cleaner! I only have one criticism. You HAVE to take the brush head every time you use it, otherwise rust will form. Didn't do it for a few days and I already noticed some.
"
"
Great deal for this model.  Works great on my teeth. Great purchase
"
"
Very powerful. Cleans teeth very well. Also like the slim design
"
"
Does what its intended to do. We shall see what the dental hygenist says.
"
"
I like that is lets you know every 30 seconds when to change areas you are brushing.  It forces you to brush for 2 minutes
"
"
Works great.  Had a much older model, and this is faster and cleans better.  Love it!
"
"
Bought this on January 8 and It stopped working in the first week of March! Customer service gave me a big runaround. I have to pay for shipping to the repair center!
"
"
A voir a long terme mais sinon fait la job

My old Oral B stopped working (it was several years old).  This one I think is a bit more of a basic model to what I have but it does the job.  I am happy.  Not sure why one would get a higher end version.
"
"
Good solid tooth brush switched over to electric good brush to star off with.
"
"
All that you need in a powered toothbrush.  Has good power and the battery seems to me way better than my previous oral-b model.
"
"
Definitely seems like and excellent product so far. I love it and the fast shipping
"
"
All you need for perfectly clean teeth. I did not want all the extra features of the more expensive models such as Bluetooth. I would never use these features anyway.
"
"
i support all Oral B toothbrush, i got this just for traveling purpose only.
"
"
The toothbrush has worked well. My teeth feel very clean afterward. I like the 30 second timer function.
"
"
Oral b . Trusted company. Never fails
"
"
Fonctionne très bien pas de problème
"
"
Love this thing ! Couldn’t be happier
"
"
I'm very happy overall with the shipping and the toothbrush. Shipping was faster than expected. The brush works great. I've had no issues with the sensitivity sensor. It definitely works as promised.
"
"
Product was defective. Giving this a 5 star because I the manufacturer stood behind their product and I was well looked after. I am very happy with the replacement. Delivery from Amazon was faster than expected.
"
"
Works very well,  not sure of the benefits of buying a more expansive model.
"
"
we ordered on prime day , so ok value. works good
"
"
I really like this toothbrush. I've never owned an electric before and it leaves my mouth feeling really fresh. The 2 minute timer is handy too.
"
"
I find the pulse rather rough. My last OralB was much smoother. Although I can't be bothered to return it I can't really recommend it either.
"
"
Works great, I’ve always used Philips products and I find they both do a great job.
"
"
This toothbrush is great and love using it!
"
"
The timer is amazing!  It vibrates when it’s time to move to a different section of your mouth.  Highly recommend!
"
"
I have since a few mounth and i'am very satisfied.
"
"
C est ma 3 e brosse à dents Oral-B et suis toujours aussi satisfait
"
"
Excellent produit. Je recommande.
"
"
Good Price, fast shipping and good quality, Thank you.
"
"
I've been using it for a month now and I'm really pleased with the purchase. It feels very solid and it has a great grip. The timer is very nice.
"
"
Je suis satisfait  de date de  achat
"
"
Easy to use. Love the timer. Teeth feel much cleaner. Dental hygienist is impressed with oral health improvement.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien et aide vraiment à réduire l'accumulation de tartre.
"
"
Been using this brand for over 20 years.
"
"
Teeth feel cleaner then with a regular tooth brush.  Timer function is good but doesn't alot time for brushing your tounge. Not a big negative tho
"
"
Tres bien et utile par contre la batterie n'a pas une grosse autonomie. Je l'utilise une a deux fois par jour et elle ne dure que deux jours.
"
"
It's quite better than the Oral-B Vitality, no issue with it so far.
"
"
I especially like the timer which helps to keep track of the length of my brushing .it does a very good job of keeping my mouth clean. I bought this model for travelling and am glad I did.
"
"
It is 'blah' in appearance and too thin and therefore awkward to hold. Worst of all, although a traveling case is available for it, you can't actually travel to most places with it because it's only made for 110V.
"
"
Great Value, works perfectly.....sturdy and fits perfectly in a small place
"
"
Good price good product tickles at first lol the 30 second timer helps
"
"
I have not brought it on my travels but I love the way it cleans and the timer to change to a different are of your mouth.
"
"
Rempli très bien sa fonction. Très satisfaites
"
"
Got these for the whole family. Heads last a long time and so does the battery life. Sleek design.
"
"
The toothbrush is excellent and works well
"
"
works great and for the price a very good buy
"
"
Good quality product, a bit expensive
"
"
This is a great toothbrush for its price. I am really happy with it and the replacement heads are not too costly. I am going to get a few more for other family members.
"
"
Love it, couldn't live without it! Teeth are so clean!
"
"
Every day toothpaste drips down toothbrush.  Sounds like it’s about to die.  Just not happy with it!
"
"
Its a great product at a good price
"
"
A great investment for your health. This toothbrush is like the really fancy ones but much more bare bone. You don't need all those extra features. This toothbrush is perfect! Once you use this, it becomes difficult to go back to the normal toothbrush
"
"
Satisfied with this toothbrush, the 2 minutes timer could be very useful for people who brush their teeth way too fast.
"
"
Great toothbrush! Takes a little getting used to the power of it, but works great! Replacement heads are a little expensive, mind you.
"
"
Will see performance over time ty
"
"
I thought this would have a built in timer, but it didn't. Maybe I didn't read the product description carefully. Otherwise, no complaints.
"
"
Works well, cleans teeth so well you feel like you just came from the dentist!
"
"
Works great though if you have really sensitive teeth, I recommend you upgrade to the brush that has a lower speed.
"
"
This does not hold the charge nearly as long as the older model I had purchased 10 years ago.I really do not like this one and feel I paid a way too much money for an inferior toothbrush.
"
"
no others used/purchased in past to compare to, but seems pretty good
"
"
My wife was a dental hygienist in her working life, and she loves it. Personally, I notice the ""more thorough"" clean.
"
"
That brush makes teeth white
"
"
My girlfriend just loves it
"
"
Great product for a good price
"
"
Got this brush because my hygienist highly recommended getting an electric, but I feel like my mouth feels cleaner after using a manual. The brush seems fine just doesn’t do the job as well as I was expecting
"
"
Brushes teeth very well.  Not recommended as a back scrubber.
"
"
The battery of my toothbrush is dead, recharging does not help. Since it is not sold by Amazon, I could not get a replacement. Got it on Black Friday with 40% off.
"
"
Best product I bought till date
"
"
received two of these at the black Friday price, don't think I can go wrong !
"
"
longévité de la batterie décevante
"
"
Great, affordable electric toothbrush. Works well.
"
"
I've had an Oral B 1000 for about 5 years, just bought a second for the wife. Battery lasts longer than previous gen which is nice. Overall Great.
"
"
This replaces one I lost at hotel.
"
"
I really like it.  It cleans my teeth well and is easier on the gum line.
"
"
Works well on full charge , decent electric toothbrush but  best to keep it on the charger to always have maximum power !Still kind of loud though
"
"
Great brush great price I bought 3, 2 as gifts. Easy to use easy to charge love it.
"
"
I am so glad I bought this toothbrush. It does a great job and I love the buzz reminder at 30 secs and a longer one at 2 mins. My teeth feel and look much better.
"
"
Oral b que dire de plus...
"
"
Got this just today and there was a noticeable difference after brushing. Highly recommends this.
"
"
Plug would not go in my socket.  Had to use a extension plug
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It stays charged for days, at least 5 as I have yet to run it down. The charger is small and perfect for travel, and I got the replacement heads for a great price through Amazon as well.
"
"
Dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush.  This one didn't break the bank and my dentist noticed that I had switched.
"
"
Good tooth brush. I miss the indicator telling me that two minutes are over - now 30 second intervals.
"
"
Good quality as always
"
"
faut voir pour la longévité du produit,..Mais après 3 mois ça fonctionne encore.
"
"
Utilisé depuis deux semaines, il me semble que mes dents sont plus blanches et je sens mes dents propres comme après un nettoyage chez le dentiste!!! Je recommande fortement😁
"
"
Works well and stays charged a long time. Only one speed though, which is fine for me.
"
"
Exactly what I wanted.
"
"
Great charge, functional
"
"
Had electric toothbrushes before and have loved them.  This one feels too rough for my liking.  I was hoping for more if a ultrasonic experience like the Panasonic toothbrush.  Does the job tmthougb and was a decent price.
"
"
Timer function is a great feature
"
"
Nettoie bien, efficace
"
"
much better than competitor
"
"
Amazing does a much better job of cleaning than any other brush I've used
"
"
Love this product.  Great function at a reasonable price.  I can notice a difference from the standard hand held toothbrush.  highly recommended.
"
"
I have had a regular (i.e. cheap) electric Oral-B for a few years, and I was pretty happy with it. During my last dental checkup, my dentist mentioned that I should think on using a professional power toothbrush. You see, the pH in my mouth is quite alkaline (he said), which protects me from cavities but facilitates plaque formation. Power brushes are excellent for plaque removal. I said to him I'll think about it.I was not sure if investing in a more expensive brush would be worth it, but luckily my local big box store has a display of the available Oral-B power brushes, from the simplest to the most fancy. This allowed me to actually feel the HUGE difference in power between a regular electric brush, and the ones in the professional line. The higher up you go in this line, the more expensive they get. Power wise, there is no difference between the humble 1000 and the super fancy 5000. Of course, with the latter you get a LCD telling you the brushing time, the pressure against the teeth, etc. All things I can live without, and still getting a true office clean feeling after every brushing.So far the brushing experience has been great. You need to remember to be gentle on the pressure while brushing, otherwise it could be bad for your gums.I'll update the post with longer use and experience. This is a highly recommended toothbrush.UPDATE January 2015 - Well, I am happy to report that the brush is truly a good investment in oral health. My last 3 dental checkups have shown a decrease in the amount of plaque, which it never happened before while I was using the regular electric brush.The actual brush is as good as new. I haven't noticed any issues with the rechargeable battery or with the brushing power. I change the head every 2 to 3 months, depending on its condition, and not really following the colour change indicating bristles.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Head fits other Oral-B toothbrushes. I was replacing one that didn't hold a charge anymore.  The other one lasted for about 5 years so I know it's a good product.
"
"
Very good quality. My hygienist was impressed with my brushing after 2 weeks of using this brush! It's noisier than my previous one but also more efficient, so I'm ok with the noise if it means better brushing.
"
"
It’s s good electric toothbrush. I’ve had the same one before my stopped working for a least 4yrs
"
"
Sweet device, great price and arrived next day. Only have to charge it once a week (I use it twice daily). Mouth feels so clean vs using a standard brush.
"
"
Good Tooth brush at a fair price. Been using it for over a year now and still works flawless.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
Solid toothbrush
"
"
Love my brush! Black does show a the toothpaste though so needs to be rinsed extra well
"
"
Très très bien👍
"
"
unit works quite noisy  used it twice ...stay tuned
"
"
Best money I ever invested on my teeth! Works great and charges easily. It's awesome that everything you need is inside the box, just unwrap and brush!
"
"
I bought this to my boyfriend and it only works for half year.  Now it can't be turn on even it's fully charged
"
"
Very good product. Charges fast, comes with a charger you just set the tooth brush on. Super convenient.
"
"
Works great so far
"
"
Very nice brush. Notice a difference in how my teeth feel already in a few days use.
"
"
Really good got the price
"
"
it works and came the same day
"
"
Had my first one for a long time, probably a decade. Replaced it with another that works great!
"
"
This was a replacement , very happy with it.
"
"
I think it does a great job of cleaning
"
"
Gentle, yet thorough cleaning. Can’t ask for more than tat.
"
"
It's ok, does the job however it's very loud and uncomfortable
"
"
Perfect! High-quality brush. Battery last for a week. Using it for a year and still works like a charm!
"
"
Works well. Good charge.
"
"
These brushes are an excellent purchase...Thank you Amazon for such a selection...
"
"
For $50 a great. We toothbrush
"
"
It's a little bit louder than my previous electric toothbrush, but it's not something I'm too worried about. Looking at how fast it moves made me think it was slow, but once actually using it on my teeth, I realized it moves faster than my previous one. This is a great brush!
"
"
I am extremely happy with my purchase. I like the pulse timer, and the ease of the device.  I would highly recommend this device to anyone interested in an electric toothbrush.
"
"
The best toothbrush I ever tried.Realy does what is supposed to do.Great to clean between teeth.Amazing product.
"
"
The battery life is great.
"
"
Great toothbrush!
"
"
Great toothbrush.
"
"
Good quality, very satisfied and long battery.
"
"
Good price and good quality
"
"
Love my Oral-B Pro 1000, cleans my mouth and teeth effortlessly. Would recommend for starters using electric toothbrush due to power not being so strong for those with sensitive gums.
"
"
la livraison s'est faite tel que prévue et l'article était comme décrit .
"
"
I like that it does a very good job of cleaning my teeth.  They feel just as clean as the cleaning done by the dentist""s office
"
"
The battery will last you 5 days on a road trip tops. It was a great clean but the brush bristles got weaker after only 5 cleanings making it feel less powerful.
"
"
Not sure if it's just me but I couldn't handle the roughness on teeth and gum. It felt like the brush was trying to know my teeth out :)
"
"
Too noisy and rattley, I sent it back. I like my sonic brush better.
"
"
Works grate looks grate
"
"
Battery won’t hold charge for long, timer never worked , not made for travel -
"
"
Product is as advertisedWould recommend to family and friends
"
"
minuterie intégré pour nous indiquer quand changer de coté
"
"
Je n'avais jamais eu une brosse à dents électrique...c’est fou la différence...n'hésiter pas à vous procurer ce modèle en particulier...je vois pas ce qu'un modèle plus cher fait de plus car celui-ci satisfait amplement pour un brossage de dent...même que le monde trouve que j'ai l'air moins bête!:)
"
"
excellent produit
"
"
Great item for the price, only downside is that it's a little loud
"
"
I'm embarrassed to say that I brush more regularly now with this product. It just so easy now!
"
"
Aaaaaa+++++
"
"
Love it.
"
"
bonne qualité
"
"
Bon rapport qualité prix.
"
"
Perfect
"
"
I haven't traveled with it so therefore cannot comment. I do not like the timer function.
"
"
So far so good. Works like my previous one that I busted when I tried charging overseas.
"
"
Exactly what I am looking for
"
"
It has reasonable price. But only one speed  Good design and quality.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush, would recommend it. Shipping was fast as always with Amazon.
"
"
Absolutely love this tooth brush! Leaves my teeth clean and the toothbrush head is small enough to get into all the difficult areas in the back of my mouth.
"
"
This product was recommended to me by my oral specialist to help keep plaque down.  It has been doing a good job.
"
"
It’s very reliable, easy to use, and way less messy than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
great way to deep clean your teeth my mouth is very happy, thanks
"
"
It stopped working withing 2 weeks of use.
"
"
recommended
"
"
I feel like I get a really good clean with this brush! I also really like that it vibrates as a sign of timing how long you're brushing for.
"
"
It's a toothbrush, it brushes teeth, what else is there to say. It brushes teeth better than a non-electric toothbrush.
"
"
Like how clean my teeth are.. good teach in between the teethThe vibration is heavy, tho tolerable
"
"
Used item less then 1 month and doesn't charge on it's stand any longer.
"
"
Fonctionne bien , batterie durable si vous l'utiliser comme conseillé .
"
"
love this! Got it on sale for a great price. My teeth feel super clean after each use.
"
"
I have been use for a week and is excellent
"
"
Soins dentaires
"
"
Great
"
"
Mine didn’t come with part (g) .. (the brushes holder than connects to the charger) I’m not sure if it’s supposed to come with it? But I don’t have it..
"
"
Replacing a 10 yr old one, works great, I forgot how much power it had at the beginning.
"
"
Lasts maybe about a week which is expected. Worked well with no issues
"
"
Great cleaning . Purchased this product again and again and will continue to do do so !
"
"
Best electric toothbrush- leaves teeth feeling smooth and shiny
"
"
Works well. Holds a charge for quite some time (I put it back on the charger once a week).  My teeth feel really clean when I am done using it.
"
"
Battery life is great. Replacing my previousone that has lasted for years.  For travelling it should come with some type of case or bag to keep it clean.
"
"
Really like this toothbrush! There is no travel case or anything to protect the brush head that comes with it. However, the brush is powerful and makes my mouth feel so clean.
"
"
Great!
"
"
Très satisfaite !
"
"
Great product! Very pleased. Will go on-line to see whether I can purchase a travelling kit.
"
"
This was recommended by my dental hygienist -- and its everything she said it would be!
"
"
Works great
"
"
As expected
"
"
Mon chum l'adore sa nettoie en cliss qui dit
"
"
Perso
"
"
For the first time in my life the dental hygienist told me i'm doing good job with cleaning my teeth, lol
"
"
Would Buy Again
"
"
Charge lasts long good quality arrived fast
"
"
Low scores only because I do not use these functions. Product meets all expectations.
"
"
very usefull
"
"
Goodbye old toothbrush. These electric brushes are the way to go, very happy I ordered this.
"
"
Arrived early. The Oral B 1000 is much thinner than the 300. Easier to hold and maneuver.
"
"
I purchased this powered toothbrush as a replacement for an earlier model (from the same manufacturer) that had worked for me for at least a decade. The new one arrived promptly, appropriately packaged, and worked first time with no problems. It has only one ""speed"" (unlike its predecessor, which had two speeds), but the speed is perfectly fine. Definitely recommended.
"
"
I love it and I will definitely buy it again
"
"
I charged the toothbrush all day, the yellow battery icon is flashing and yet, when I press the start button, nothing happens.
"
"
Powerful, I feel very clean after using it.The instructions are great as well, there is a guideline on how you should use this to brush.The Battery lasts for a week which is excellentI brush twice a day.Hopefully it will last a couple of years
"
"
Very nice product. Great brushing. Good value
"
"
for most 2 years, still working in perfert condition. Just need to change brush head, easy to clean tooths.
"
"
works great shipping quick
"
"
Très satisfaite!
"
"
It cleans my teeth really well compared to my old sonicare toothbrush. Nice and effective.
"
"
BEST ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH FOR THE PRICE.
"
"
Wow, this is much more powerful than my old one.  Very nice upgrade.
"
"
Have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years. Love how it makes my teeth feel after brushing.
"
"
I bought this because I wanted to upgrade from the Vitality pro I've been using for a few years. I read so many reviews and decided to give this one a try. I love it! My teeth feel super clean after every use. Very happy with it!
"
"
Compact and fits the use for travel well with the case acquired.  The timer function built in is also very beneficial
"
"
I can t compare because never had electric toothbrush before but this definitely worth the investment
"
"
Works okay but has only 1speed.
"
"
Not as powerful or great as my old Soniccare, however, the price was right.
"
"
Bonne brosse a dents
"
"
Le brossage est très efficace mais l’efficacité diminue au bout de 3 jours..  la brosse à dent doit être rechargée plus souvent.  Je suis quand même très satisfaite.
"
"
J'aime bien la minuterie
"
"
Not true: ""Senses when you brush too hard with pressure sensor""I find this tooth brush's motor to be too aggressive.
"
"
Livraison rapide. Brosse à dents très efficace et sans gadget inutile.La tête  est agréable et facile à changer. Je recommande sans hésitation.
"
"
Produit offert en cadeau d'échange pour Noël.  Selon la dite personne, elle adore sa nouvelle brosse à dents.  Très bon produit et surtout très efficace.
"
"
Everything,  everything went smoothly from time of purchase till the product reached my residence undamaged.  Product is amazing best investment I've made to date on my Teeth. Thank you 😁
"
"
Étuit de voyage serait apprécié
"
"
Used for one month and now will not work.
"
"
Not a very powerful toothbrush.  Needs charging frequently as it works better with a full charge.
"
"
AAAAA++++
"
"
Battery could be better. Recharge everyweek
"
"
Very good but not sure where to buy the extra brushes.. bought some today but I don’t think they are compatible
"
"
What can I say, Oral B doesn't disappoint.
"
"
as advertised, great toothbrush
"
"
Seems as good as the much more expensive one I had before, same brand too.
"
"
3rd Oral b, I love the clean feel and the pulse timer
"
"
I purchased a noisy one. Because I need to brush, it wasn’t worth the bother to return. First one like this. Strange.
"
"
Brushes are too rough on my sensitive gums. Do not reccomend this at all.
"
"
no 1
"
"
Purchased for my partner and he is crazy about this toothbrush. He is very pleased with the whole mouth clean.
"
"
A gift for someone and this was the condition it came in.
"
"
Love it!  Very light, gentle and my teeth have never been so clean!
"
"
I love it. Like coming out of the dentist
"
"
Works as described.
"
"
Great quality, great price (on sale) and the charger makes it very convenient.
"
"
Good for the price
"
"
Absolutely love this
"
"
Très bon.
"
"
I like it works Really good
"
"
One of the best electric toothbrushes I have ever owned. Very satisfied.
"
"
Works really well and is very effective. The teeth feel like they have been polished.
"
"
Love this. You don’t need to spend a lot of $ for a quality toothbrush
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Although we already had an oral b electric tooth brush we find this to be much more superior
"
"
It's good, but the rubber where the on button is is starting to peel off after only 6 months.
"
"
It works well
"
"
Love it! Teeth so clean
"
"
Arrived sooooooo late but other than that pretty good
"
"
Loveee
"
"
Awesome toothbrush cleans well!
"
"
This is a really good product. the 30 second timer really makes this a mindless activity, and the brush leaves my teeth feeling after dentist clean.
"
"
Powerful toothbrush. Leaves your teeth feeling very clean and smooth. The battery lasts long as well
"
"
Great
"
"
Was replacing my 10 yr old one that died, same great brushing, no complaints and got shipped fast.
"
"
First electric toothbrush I've ever owned. Had no troubles, issues or problems. Does exactly what it's supposed to.
"
"
Excellent produit à bon prix, livraion rapide.
"
"
Good
"
"
The round brush head of course
"
"
I have used a battery operated tooth brush for years but the rechargeable Electric Toothbrush does an incredibly great job....very happy I made this transition.
"
"
Cleans my teeth well.
"
"
Je suis decu car la tete pivote pas
"
"
Love it, works great and charge holds for the time needed. It vibrates every 30s and then a longer vibrate after 2min so you know when you can stop brushing.
"
"
Le brossage de dents du soir.J’aurais aimé un avertissement que la batterie achève au lieu qu’elle arrête subitement!
"
"
After searching  stores here , price was very much the same
"
"
The product was delivered very quickly and is as described. Works very well, I'm am very happy with it.
"
"
I use it for almost about one month, everything is well, not find any problem. I have not make it clear that the how to use the discount card wich is bing at the same product mailbox, and why not have a chinese language booklet?
"
"
This is the third Oral-B 1000 Electric toothbrush I have had and I am always pleased with the product. Lasts forever and cleans effectively.
"
"
Perfect! And way better price than in store I found for the same thing.
"
"
Great and powerful brush, charge last for over 10 uses
"
"
So far so good
"
"
this is an amazing product!  it cleans well and battery life lasts a long time (1-2 weeks) even when brushing 2/3 times per day
"
"
Ideal a+
"
"
Cleans your teeth like 700% better than using anything else. One full charge lasts 5-6 days with 2x/day usage.
"
"
Amazing! Thank you amazon for having this on sale. Works great and gets the teeth cleaning done right. I just don’t like how loud it can be hahah
"
"
Did not comment on battery life since I have only used for a few weeks.  Need a carrying case for travelling.
"
"
Teeth feel so clean and so much whiter.
"
"
Firm toothbrushing.  I love the way it feels.
"
"
Bought this for my son who was skeptical it would be any different than any other toothbrush.  He messaged me the other day to tell me it was “dentist quality”.
"
"
Great value,Perfect for kids
"
"
The battery life died after a while of use and I am no longer able to return it. It is now not useable as the battery doesn’t even last 30 seconds.
"
"
Does what it is supposed to do.
"
"
Best toothbrush investment ever... My mouth feels like I just left the dentist office....
"
"
Super je l'adore et ca nettoie tellement mieux qu'une brosse normal !!!
"
"
Quotidienne. La charge ne tient pas plus que 5 jours....
"
"
We ordered one for myself and my wife and we noticed a difference right away! Good product
"
"
I think I like it after several weeks use.  Not sure of battery duration. after 5 days it is running but not as powerful.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Great product! It is simple and effective. Great value for money.
"
"
Significantly different and better than regular toothbrushes
"
"
Works great. Holds the charge for days
"
"
je viens de la recevoir je ne peux pas l'évaluer...les questions ne conviennent pas au produit. Lorsque ont viens de le recevoir...
"
"
Works as expected
"
"
This doesn’t come with the pressure sensor as listed in the description. Don’t purchase this item if that is what you are looking for
"
"
Love it.
"
"
Works for a while but doesn't hold a charge after a few months and hope it's totally useless. Not happy at all!
"
"
It works well
"
"
Works as expected
"
"
Absolutely wonderful, nothing wrong with it. Can go many days without a charge. Would recommend to anyone.
"
"
Bought this for my son, and he is really liking it.  Was pretty powerful and took some getting used too, but it is well worth it.
"
"

Bought these for my husband and I. We love them so much! Teeth feel very clean, charging is very simple. Heads are not to expensive!
"
"
Je la recommande excellent
"
"
Works great, but surprisingly loud. Like that it indicates when to switch quadrants. Holds a charge for a long time too!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Everything about my toothbrush is excellent.  I love it.

5 stars ⭐️
"
"
Great
"
"
great product
"
"
Best tooth brush I've ever owned! Feels like it's polishing up your teeth, battery lasts for about 10 rounds before needing a charge.
"
"
I was initially really pleased with this product...until the battery completely died (even charged for 20+hrs as recommended) not even 2 months after getting it...
"
"
use is for cleaning teeth
"
"
Great got It last Black Friday and still kicking
"
"
As a tooth brush a 5 in all......cleaning my boots.... not so great a 2
"
"
after you try a electric toothbrush like this one, you'll never gone a use a regular toothbrush. good product!
"
"
Bon appareil qui fait du brossage de dents une mois grosse corvée.
"
"
Works not too bad but battery is awful-and this is new??-can not hold for 3 brushes-very disappointed
"
"
Noisier than my previous electric toothbrush, but much better at getting to back teeth and the backs of front teeth.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it does an amazing job. Couldn't be happier with the item.
"
"
Nothing to complain about really. Overall a good product
"
"
Exactly as advertised.
"
"
Love this tooth brush, since switching to electric my teeth have never been so clean
"
"
Really love this brush. My teeth feel sooooo much cleaner than using a manual brush. Very pleased.
"
"
C'est un cadeau et la personne renouvelait le même produit, donc satisfaite.
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dents, or je me questionne sur la durée de vis de la batterie.(suivi les recommandations du fournisseur)
"
"
Good if you want a step up from your regular electronic toothbrushes
"
"
After use I feel like I just came from the Dentist after a cleaning.
"
"
wonderful
"
"
Excellent product. I recommend it 100%.
"
"
I received the product that was described.
"
"

Works very well, I really like the intermittent time of 30 seconds.
"
"
wife loves it, really powerful
"
"
Un achat genial.
"
"
The battery quality is so bad, only can last for 3 days
"
"
good length and power
"
"
Went from a manual brush to this electric and my teeth have not been cleaner, delivers on ad that it cleans teeth by gum line well
"
"
Bought the black and the white version. Great products
"
"
Would like to see a larger brushes for these. Takes longer to cover the area.
"
"
Such a great toothbrush. I’m so happy I made this purchase!
"
"
Excellent product

Great product, only gripe is the advertised sensor which detects when brushing too roughly doesn't actually seem to work.
"
"
This is a purchase for my son, Good
"

"
"
best of third one I have bought. I recommend this item
"
"
Brushes teeth, yep. Works 100% as intended, motor doesn't seem weak. Charging is pain free.
"
"
For brushing my teeth.  I haven't had it very long so your rate features are not conclusive as yet.
"
"
I have used oral-B electric tooth brush for years and truly believe it has helped me keep my teeth healthy.
"
"
It feels like it’s dounf most of the work for me. Looking into the Genius 8000
"
"
Comparing to other tooth brushes that we had this one is very weak.

"
"
The best electric toothbrush on the market.  This one is the very basic one compared to the other models .
"
"
It works well but there is no sound or timer as promised.
"
"
Due to some reason it’s not charging. After 2 min use it is not working
"
"
I have been using it for a month and it has been a good investment.I really like how small the recharging stand is.
"
"
Great product. Pleasure to use. My only complaint is the cost of the replacement brishes
"
"
J adore
"
"
I had the higher model for the last ten years. It showed the amount of time I brushed for, and it was heavier and more substantive, but I find this just as good.
"
"
It's exactly as advertised. I'm very happy with it.
"
"
Great product! Fast shipping! No problems!
"
"
For the price I love this toothbrush.  I'm very happy with my purchase.

I am really very pleased with this toothbrush. Before I bought it I read a number of reviews including the bad one and had a couple of concerns about buying, but I'm really happy I went ahead and bought. The first thing I did was read the instructions and felt that the negative reviews came from people who did not read how to use their brush. One example was someone said they were annoyed how the brush would hesitate how every so often, but what that is is a 30 second timer so you can ensure that you brush your teeth equally in every part of your mouth. People complained that the charging time took too long. What I learned was that the FIRST charging takes 22 hours then after that you leave the brush on the charger and its always available when you want to brush. The instructions direct that once every 6 months you let the builtin battery run right down and then you give it the full 22 hour recharge.I am finding that in 1 short month my teeth feel much cleaner and with the help of whitening tooth paste and whitening mouthrinse my teeth are starting to look whiter. It was not an overnight thing but a gradual change. I'm now recommending this brush to everyone I kmow.
"
"
Let me set the stage... I brush my teeth at least twice a day and typically three times.  I find flossing tedious and most days I don't bother.  My dentist suggested this type of brush as part of helping to address some gum irritation. This thing is great.  Tooth brushing no longer feels like and awkward messy chore.  It is quick, clean and I can feel the difference - teeth have that slick, just left the dentist feel. I like the pressure sensor that notifies me if I am pressing harder than I should.I was worried about travel and having it run out or needing to make sure it was always  in the charger. Not a concern. I cheated it overnight when it arrived. I have purposely not charged it again since then.  A week later, it is still going strong without a charge.
"
"
Love love love this toothbrush! We've since bought another Oral-B electric toothbrush (different type) from the drugstore and I don't like it nearly as much. The PRO 1000 has a timer that goes off every 30 seconds—with a longer vibration at the 2-minute mark—so you spend the correct amount of time brushing each quarter of your mouth. The charge lasts for days at a time and we just leave it on the charger overnight when it's running low. If you push too hard while brushing, it makes a weird noise so you know to ease up (a problem my husband's had in the past). I also appreciate the light on the front: if it's running low, a red light will start flashing so you know it's time to charge.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is excellent, however the recharging pod has not worked. The battery lasted a while, but would not be recharged by the accompanying pod. Since my partner has a similar Oral-B, I used her charger pod, and it recharged my toothbrush just fine.  There should be a long enough warranty coming with these pods, 3 months is not enough, as it takes longer to know if it works.
"
"
I bought this to replace another similar unit that simply wasn't holding a charge anymore.If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get.  You don't need anything fancy, they're not going to clean your teeth better than this, and it will pulse every 30 seconds as well as an extra at the 2 minute mark to let you know whey're you're done.  You don't need a digital timer in the handle that you're not going to see anyway.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush.  I do find it a bit noisy, but that doesn't affect my review.  As this is a new thing for me, I can't compare the vibration to anything else, it just seems a little more rough than I anticipated.  But nonetheless, this brush makes me feel like I get a much better clean than my manual brush.  I really like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area.I chose this brush instead of the next step up because the others are all ""smart"" brushes and have apps you can put on your phone.  Last thing I need is an app for my toothbrush.I spoke with a dentist who is a good friend of mine, and she was happy to hear I purchased this.  It is the same brush that her and her husband have, so I suppose I made a good choice!
"
"
Agréablement surprise. C'était un achat impulsif du black Friday, mais je ne reviendrai  pas à une brosse à dent normale. Le brossage est incroyable, surtout pour les dents du fond, plus difficile à bien brosser. La charge dure longtemps. Je n'ai pas de prise de courant dans ma salle de bain, mais ce n'est pas un problème car une charge dure un peu plus de deux semaines (deux brossages par jour).
"
"
It's a good electronic toothbrush for what it is. You get one setting, and to me that isn't a problem at all as I use it exclusively for only brushing.The only complaints I have with this toothbrush are:1) It's on the loud side compared to my prior electric toothbrush that kicked the bucket.2) The toothbrush does not shutoff on its lonesome after 2 minutes. It does vibrate/beep slightly differently at the two minute mark to let you know that the recommended time has elapsed.
"
"
When you don't need the nutty bells and whistles, this model works fine.  Can't really comment on battery life, since they go back on the charger after each use.  The manual recommends a complete discharge every 6 months, so I've marked my calendar for December.  These replace a single brush, with multiple heads, that we used for 10 years before the battery finally couldn't hold enough juice to spin the brush fast enough for a proper clean.  We never did the periodic discharge with that one, though, so maybe these will last 15 years...
"
"
I am quite pleased with this toothbrush, especially since I was able to get it on sale! Its full retail price is a bit much in my opinion, given that it only includes one brush head. If it included a second brush head, the price would be more reasonable. But my favourite things about this toothbrush are that it lasts quite a long time (I can usually go about a full week, brushing twice a day, before having to recharge it - it takes about a full day to charge completely) and it also has vibration notifications every 30 seconds which I find very helpful for knowing how long to spend brushing each section of my teeth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back). My old electric toothbrush would buzz after two minutes, but I like that this one buzzes every 30 seconds to guide you. Overall I'm very happy with it and would definitely recommend it, although I would also recommend trying to get it on sale if you can or perhaps finding one with an additional brush head included.

The instructions direct that once every 6 months you let the builtin battery run right down and then you give it the full 22 hour recharge.I am finding that in 1 short month my teeth feel much cleaner and with the help of whitening tooth paste and whitening mouthrinse my teeth are starting to look whiter. It was not an overnight thing but a gradual change. I'm now recommending this brush to everyone I kmow.

Let me set the stage... I brush my teeth at least twice a day and typically three times.  I find flossing tedious and most days I don't bother.  My dentist suggested this type of brush as part of helping to address some gum irritation. This thing is great.  Tooth brushing no longer feels like and awkward messy chore.  It is quick, clean and I can feel the difference - teeth have that slick, just left the dentist feel. I like the pressure sensor that notifies me if I am pressing harder than I should.I was worried about travel and having it run out or needing to make sure it was always  in the charger. Not a concern. I cheated it overnight when it arrived. I have purposely not charged it again since then.  A week later, it is still going strong without a charge.

Love love love this toothbrush! We've since bought another Oral-B electric toothbrush (different type) from the drugstore and I don't like it nearly as much. The PRO 1000 has a timer that goes off every 30 seconds—with a longer vibration at the 2-minute mark—so you spend the correct amount of time brushing each quarter of your mouth. The charge lasts for days at a time and we just leave it on the charger overnight when it's running low. If you push too hard while brushing, it makes a weird noise so you know to ease up (a problem my husband's had in the past). I also appreciate the light on the front: if it's running low, a red light will start flashing so you know it's time to charge.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is excellent, however the recharging pod has not worked. The battery lasted a while, but would not be recharged by the accompanying pod. Since my partner has a similar Oral-B, I used her charger pod, and it recharged my toothbrush just fine.  There should be a long enough warranty coming with these pods, 3 months is not enough, as it takes longer to know if it works.
"
"
I bought this to replace another similar unit that simply wasn't holding a charge anymore.If you're looking for a power toothbrush, this is the one to get.  You don't need anything fancy, they're not going to clean your teeth better than this, and it will pulse every 30 seconds as well as an extra at the 2 minute mark to let you know whey're you're done.  You don't need a digital timer in the handle that you're not going to see anyway.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush.  I do find it a bit noisy, but that doesn't affect my review.  As this is a new thing for me, I can't compare the vibration to anything else, it just seems a little more rough than I anticipated.  But nonetheless, this brush makes me feel like I get a much better clean than my manual brush.  I really like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area.I chose this brush instead of the next step up because the others are all ""smart"" brushes and have apps you can put on your phone.  Last thing I need is an app for my toothbrush.I spoke with a dentist who is a good friend of mine, and she was happy to hear I purchased this.  It is the same brush that her and her husband have, so I suppose I made a good choice!

Agréablement surprise. C'était un achat impulsif du black Friday, mais je ne reviendrai  pas à une brosse à dent normale. Le brossage est incroyable, surtout pour les dents du fond, plus difficile à bien brosser. La charge dure longtemps. Je n'ai pas de prise de courant dans ma salle de bain, mais ce n'est pas un problème car une charge dure un peu plus de deux semaines (deux brossages par jour).
"
"
It's a good electronic toothbrush for what it is. You get one setting, and to me that isn't a problem at all as I use it exclusively for only brushing.The only complaints I have with this toothbrush are:1) It's on the loud side compared to my prior electric toothbrush that kicked the bucket.2) The toothbrush does not shutoff on its lonesome after 2 minutes. It does vibrate/beep slightly differently at the two minute mark to let you know that the recommended time has elapsed.
"
"
When you don't need the nutty bells and whistles, this model works fine.  Can't really comment on battery life, since they go back on the charger after each use.  The manual recommends a complete discharge every 6 months, so I've marked my calendar for December.  These replace a single brush, with multiple heads, that we used for 10 years before the battery finally couldn't hold enough juice to spin the brush fast enough for a proper clean.  We never did the periodic discharge with that one, though, so maybe these will last 15 years...
"
"
I am quite pleased with this toothbrush, especially since I was able to get it on sale! Its full retail price is a bit much in my opinion, given that it only includes one brush head. If it included a second brush head, the price would be more reasonable. But my favourite things about this toothbrush are that it lasts quite a long time (I can usually go about a full week, brushing twice a day, before having to recharge it - it takes about a full day to charge completely) and it also has vibration notifications every 30 seconds which I find very helpful for knowing how long to spend brushing each section of my teeth (top front, top back, bottom front, bottom back). My old electric toothbrush would buzz after two minutes, but I like that this one buzzes every 30 seconds to guide you. Overall I'm very happy with it and would definitely recommend it, although I would also recommend trying to get it on sale if you can or perhaps finding one with an additional brush head included.

"
Good quality except the brisstle it fizzled out very fast. Has to be replaced (of course using it as it should be)...

I've been using Oral-B toothbrushes for almost twenty years. I use an Oral-B Genius 8000 toothbrush at home, and decided to purchase another one to carry with me to work to brush my teeth after lunch. I opted to buy a cheaper model the Oral-B Pro 1000. What I like about the 1000 model is that it does as good a job brushing my teeth compared to the 8000. I usually only use the ""normal"" brushing mode in the 8000, which is pretty much the same as the 1000 experience. The 1000 model has a slimmer handle, which I prefer in my hand, compared to the ""chubbier"" 8000 handle. The only downside of the 1000 is the Ni-Cad battery; the Li-Ion battery of the 8000 model is far superior. I'm satisfied with the 1000 model and recommend it!
"
"
For some reason, there doesn't seem to be a proper seal on this brush. I use it, rinse it off, put it in the stand. And my stand ends up with a ring of blue from toothpaste dripping out of the handle. I've had Oral-B brushes before and never had this problem. Not very happy with this purchase. The brush works and feels good to use; but messy to have standing on my bathroom vanity.UPDATE: To be more clear, when I rinse the brush off, I do so under running water while the brush is still running. I remove the head, rinse the post, dry off the handle, and put the brush back on. The blue ring that repeatedly forms on my base occurs despite these efforts to keep the brush clean. And I've owned an Oral-B before without experiencing this leaking issue.
"
"
When new this toothbrush works very well. The 30 second timer is great and I like the size of the toothbrush. I never really felt like it cleaned better than the cheaper model that you can get for half the price. It doesn't seem like the movement is any faster than the cheap one, so what's the point of paying more?Despite it not really performing better than the cheap one, I did like this toothbrush until it stopped working. It looks like the problem is that it won't charge, but I've tried it on two identical chargers, so the problem is the toothbrush itself. I didn't spend a premium on a toothbrush only for it to fail after 3 months (July to October). After reading some of the other reviews it appears that early failure is a common problem, so I definitely won't buy Oral-B again. It's too bad because previous cheaper toothbrushes from them lasted many years.

I bought this after using Philips sonicare for many years. I decided to change as the replacement head for the sonicare was expensive and it did not seam to clean as thoroughly. I also had water getting in between the handle and the brush heads that lead to decline in the intensity of vibration. So far this product has been good as it rotates instead of vibrating and cleans better.
"
"
First if I’m never going back to manual brushes. This is a practical electric toothbrush with out the extra frills. Great for practical no nonsense people that want simplicity.I use with cross action head and I’m thoroughly satisfied.I have so much more access to the surface area of my teeth and gums.I actually enjoy using this thing.This would be great for kids, it works with the kids brush heads too. Awesome way to thoroughly clean young children’s teeth.Slime issue...So I read a few reviews about the “slime” issue.That slime is actually a mixture of the user’s saliva and toothpaste created while brushing. It drips down your mouth and onto the brush and gets into the part the brush head sits on.So it’s not the toothbrushes fault or Oral B.Just clean your brush by rinsing it.The toothbrush instructions on the package specifically say to pop off the head and rinse the two pieces under the running water after each use.So there you have it, all you have to do is rinse as you would a manual brush.
"
"
I jumped on the electric toothbrush bandwagon so late but I'm never going back to a regular tooth brush!Buy one that rotates instead of one that just oscillates back and forth because they clean better.The battery lasts for about 7 days and charging takes like 24 hours.Super easy to clean, just run it under water and dry it with a towel.2-min timer function makes sure you clean sufficiently. My dentist has noticed a difference in my oral health!I wish the vibration every 30-seconds was stronger, sometimes in the morning when your tired you don't notice it. The vibration at the end of the 2-mins is strong enough.Despite what the manual that came with it says, it does not have different brushing ""modes""! The power button turns it on/off, that's it. Though I don't care about those different ""modes"" it does the intended job sufficiently!The ""pressure sensor"" is not noticeable at all, I don't notice a difference in the ""pulsation"" no matter how light or hard I brush!
"
"
This toothbrush is ""ok"".. I've had two sonicares, which I prefer because they both had is a ""smoother"" type of brushing and were much less noisy.This Oral B electric tooth brush is very loud...I was surprised. The timer seems fine and I have not yet travelled with it. Also, the round brush is bigger and differently shaped than the one on the sonicare.  I have a small mouth, so, it took me some getting used to using it.  I'm sure it cleans the teeth fine.The price of the Oral B is less than 1/2 the price of the sonicare, which is a benefit.
"
"
Franchement, ya tu du monde qui aime ça ?Malgré ce que les écrits laissent entendre, il y A PAS d'ajustement de pression.. c'est ""full blast"" tout le temps.  La tête de brossage qui vient avec est très rigide.  Même les neurones me tremblent.  Je vais essayer de la retourner, ça juste pas de bon sens
"
"
This toothbrush is way too loud. Sounds like there is a drill in your mouth. It also doesn’t feel like it’s cleaning my teeth as well.I don’t know if it’s just this model, as it is the entry level one.I bought this after using the sonic care and was not impressed.Will be returning this product.
"
"
Quality toothbrush. Long lasting. The charger will die on you though before the toothbrush. Not sure if there's replacement chargers for these things? Hopefully! I just bought a brand new one because my old one's charger died. I won't be doing it again , will switch brands if the charger dies again.Black will show toothpaste ""spills"" and drips more, so I kind of wish I got the white version.After a few months, you will notice it doesn't hold a charge as long , as with most things.I haven't actually noticed or used the timer function which it says it has?Not ideal for traveling because you'll have to bring this AND your charger because it will not last for a whole week vacation. Easier to just pack a manual toothbrush for travel.
"
"
I got this as a gift and unfortunately, it didn't hold any charge. It only works for about 2 charges and then dies IMMEDIATELY and is never full when it's charging. I'm not sure how to return it and get a new one since all they say is ""return and we'll give you back your money""....I just want one that works!!
"
"
Excellent for Senior.....I recently purchased a 2nd oral B power toothbrush gift for my 82 yr ole mother.  She absolutely loves the oral B....it was recommended by her dentist to get power brush....oral B is a lot softer and safer brushing on her receding gums....the timer works great not to over clean....charge needed approx. once every 3 weeks...Cleans better then a normal toothbrush, and ez to clean every single tooth and especially the molars in the back.  I purchased one last year for my hubby - xmas gift.....the brush tip lasted him 1 year.....they both highly recommend this product!!!....Fast shipping and delivery with Amazon.

This toothbrush for me was a significant upgrade over conventional toothbrushes. The brush allowed me to better clean my bracers and teeth significantly improving my oral hygiene with it's capabilities. That being said, I initially purchased this specific version due to the lower price however it isn't truly indicative of the full cost picture. The toothbrush alone for the cost was good but the replacement heads are simply out there.For bracers, I found it best to just use the Cross action head that came with it instead of their other floss action, bracers specific whatever. If you want to clean you will need the cross action.Overall I'm quite satisfied with the purchase, nothing really wrong with it except the cost of replacement heads. I've tried third party replacements and they don't do as good a job for my bracers.
"
"
It seems like a good toothbrush for some, but it doesnt work for me.There was no indication for brushing too hard, and the bristles kept getting stuck in the wire behind my bottom teeth. I had to go to the orthodontist to get one of the bristles removed, so I'm going to try and return the brush.If you have mobility issues it seems like a great toothbrush, but I think I'm going to go back to a regular toothbrush.
"
"
I had an older model of the Philips Sonicare brush, and thought when it wore out it would be interesting to try a different type of brush. I think I like this brush even more. It is definitely a little less sophisticated (i.e., no automatic shut off after the 4 quarters are done), but honestly, that all is a bit of a gimmick in my book. What I like about this brush is the head can get back to the very back teeth much more easily, and those are the teeth my dental care experts mostly gripe about. So with this, I think they will have far less to complain about. I feel it does a very good job. More than satisfied, and I recommend this product.
"
"
This toothbrush sounds like a diesel truck on a cold winter morning. After you place ear plugs in and turn this bad boy on you'll get 40 seconds of clean operation. Then your saliva will have accumulated enough from the toothpaste/ saliva hybrid to fill the toothbrush arm slots(unsure of their purpose) and the mess begins. It literally sprays your hybrid mouth juices out of those slots. Makes an absolute mess unless completing this task in the shower. 2 stars because my teeth look and feel clean. Unlike my counter tops.
"
"
I picked up 2 of these during the Black Friday sale. I'm wondering why I hadn't bought them sooner. They work fantastic. I had been using the cheap Oral-B battery operated brushes for years and I thought they were doing a good job. Boy was I mistaken. There is a definite difference in cleanliness using this brush. I also like the fact it pulses to let you know to switch the area you're brushing every 30 seconds. My only gripe is that it's pretty rough out of the box. It's a bit cumbersome to change how vigorously it cleans.
"
"
So I tried this out for a week. It was just okay.I just don’t like the circular brush head. Yes it cleans one tooth at a time. But it actually hurts my gums.It’s also very loud. I mean very loud.And it doesn’t come with a case so it’s not good for traveling.I love the sonic toothbrush. It’s just better.
"
"
I purchased this toothbrush as a Christmas present for my girlfriend and she loves . It's quiet a full charge has last so far over a week it looks great it feels great in the hand and she says she would never go back to an ordinary toothbrush again. The plastics it's made of appear to be very high quality and is waterproof and can be used in the shower or bath without any worry . I'm going to buy one for myself and I highly recommend . Thank you Amazon
"
"
Further to original review, after three weeks of use, this toothbrush no longer holds a charge.  I’m not sure why.  Too bad as the toothbrush is great but would be better if the charge held for several days.  Others in my family have no issues with theirs so this one must be a bum one:(Love this! Great cost  for product.  Toothbrush holds charge for a week plus and feels great.  Would buy again.
"
"
PERFECT replacement for my +10yr old previous Oral-B. Nothing fancy (it's a toothbrush, for heaven's sake) but excellent strength, love the quadrant signals, and the small recharger stand (perfect for limited space near our sink.) No toothbrush head holder, but my husband and I simply store each of ours in a small shot-glass size container in the drawer beneath our sink. On that note: this comes with one head only. Recommend ordering replacements when you buy this unit. The generic heads we bought with this unit were also fabulous.
"
"
My dentist always nagged me for brushing too hard and ruining my enamel. This toothbrush lets me brush without worry of using too much pressure and it's done such a good job on my teeth. Make sure to let it charge for 22-24 hours the first time you plug it in. After that it's quite good for battery life! This is my first ever electronic toothbrush and I'm really happy I made the purchase.
"
"
I'll try to use for a few days but the first time I saw blood which never happened in Sonicare. I was extra careful not to push in.I also just noticed that this product was released in 2011...that explains the outdated specs like no 220v support. Sonicare can be taken out of the country without fuss.
"
"
I used to have a Braun 5000 model but I was not using any of the various modes. So I bought this one with only one function, the one I was using all the time with the 5000 model... for 50$ instead of 250$.I’m very satisfied but I am missing the timer that came with the 5000 model. I’ll get used to look at the clock.The brushing is fantastic, my older one was 7 years old so this one must incorporate new technology.
"
"
This Braun 1000 model has great basic functionality and does a really fine job.  It only has one speed, but that is all you'll ever need.  All of my previously purchased brush heads fit perfectly on this replacement Braun toothbrush.  For the price, this has been a great purchase.
"
"
Pros: I upgraded from one of those $30 Oral-B brushes and found this to be a much better cleaning experience. It's a powerful brush with a very solid battery. Comes with a handy travel case.Cons: Just one issue with it - the handle is not designed to fit in your hand very well. It's wider at the bottom instead of at the top. So instead of it resting in the natural grip of your hand, you have to hold it firmly to keep it from falling. My brush has slipped from my hand many times and it's quite frustrating.
"
"
Might have received a faulty unit but the device stopped working within two months of purchase.. Was fully operational when it was working but the device can't seem to turn on. Charging pod looks fine, the indicator light flickers so it tells me that it is charging. Now I am stuck dealing with the manufacturer for the warranty, otherwise a great electric toothbrush.
"
"
Good toothbrush with a great battery life.+ Battery remains charged for a long time+ Great vibration/action+ Feels like it is well built+/- Had an issue with the motor, took it in for service and received a free upgrade! :)+/- Charging is very slow (Usually makes the battery's life longer)-Timer function is useless (Do all of your teeth, not some for the allotted time)
"
"
I bought this because my battery was failing on the one I had on for six years. The difference between this battery and that one is not the best. Maybe I should’ve gone up in the model but I don’t need all the time or Bluetooth and app functions. It’s just brushing yo teeth. I wish they would just put a dope ass battery in this thing and call it a day.
"
"
It was a gift, I’ve had no complaints. I have a cheaper model of OralB and I wouldn’t want to go without it, cleans better than a manual toothbrush and my dentist complimented me on my oral hygene. Woukd recommend ysing the sensitive brush regardless of whether your teeth are sensitive or not.
"
"
What can I say? It's an electric toothbrush. It is very fast and my teeth feel more cleaned than the manual ones I have used all my life. It has a 30 second timer between areas you need to brush too which is cool. The battery lasts a long time but prepared to clean the charger/stand as water and toothpaste residue will drip onto it--it won't damage anything but it just looks gross if you leave it too long.  Wish it included a travel head for it.
"
"
Elle fonctionne vraiment bien. La puissance est au rendez-vous
"
"
I bought this to replace my 7 year old oral-b toothbrush, but I didn't realize it only has one speed - fast. I prefer the slower speed or at least having the option to pick between the two. Not a huge problem, my fault for not reading all the features properly. I'm not returning it, I'll just deal with this one for the next few years and hopefully remember to look for multi-speed when I need another new one! :)
"
"
I bought this a week ago. The charger pod does not work! I took it off the charger for two days, and the battery is almost dead. I put it back on the charger, and it is still flashing! Note: I gave it an initial charge time of 24 hours when I first received it. Am definitely sending this back! I notice that there is no response for all of the complaints, either!
"
"
I checked other equivalent products and settled for this one. It was a good decision. It meets all the requirements expected of a tooth brushing tool and specs as advertised. I bought two one for my wife and one for myself. We have this product now for two months and it is a great product. I also bought the replacement heads that were on special price. Highly recommend.
"
"
This was my first electronic toothbrush. I found the toothbrush very loud and the vibration really strong. The battery would last about a week before needing recharging, however, this toothbrush stopped working entirely just over 3 months after buying it. I would not recommend it for travelling as it did not come with a cap for the toothbrush or any type of carrying case. The return window was very short so I can't return it. I would not recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
I've been using this brand of toothbrush since its inception.....I love the way it works, and all I can say is that I rarely if ever have had a cavity since using it.  I cant recommend it highly enough.
"
"
Great toothbrush! So good I bought 3 more for the rest of the family.. I got it for $30 black Friday deal, totally worth it. Otherwise I would buy the 500 model as it's the exact same product without the battery indicator. I have both.Cleans way better than a regular brush, 30 sec timer is quite useful, it recharges fast and has a good life between charges. I charge mine once a week.
"
"
My teeth have never felt this clean in my whole life before. I feel like I just came back from the dentist every time I use this brush. Furthermore, the small roundhead makes it easy for me to get to those hard to reach places in my mouth. I've been told by my dentist that I have an extremely small mouth and my jaw doesn't open very wide, which led to some problems with my back teeth... however with this product I can clean those teeth properly. Highly recommend this product
"
"
Nice buy in this price range, it's not as loud as most other devices. Compatible with all ProB heads and chargers which is a bonus. I've been testing how long a full charge lasts and so far I'm up to 3 days easily using 2-3 times daily and following the built in timer. Charging to full is a long process though, over 12 hours. Comes in original package with 1 brush head and $10 coupon for additional heads.
"
"
The toothbrush was great until the charging dock stopped working! Considering that I do not charge the brush frequently (once every 5 days, rather than having it continuously on the dock), it's pretty baffling how this could've happened.I'm also quite bothered that there isn't a way for me to contact the seller via amazon, I've looked and looked to find an interface without success...feeling quite frustrated.
"
"
Wanted a simple unit from Oral B as this is my 3rd unit in 20 years. Product is exceptionally comfortable to hold and takes up very little space on my bathroom counter top.Yes I recommend to buy 100%Oral B please do not stop manufacturing this Non-Wi-Fi simple unit for those of us who desire the basics!Thanks
"
"
I picked this up during the Black Friday deals at a great price.  We have always purchased the cheap battery operated tooth brushes. This has a charger base that you put the tooth brush on. Light indicator shows charge remaining.  Charging time is AMAZING!  we should have tried this long ago.
"
"
I love this product! I wouldn't wanna travel with this though personally (if you wanted to you could but i'd rather just buy a cheap $1 toothbrush for the time im travelling and discard).You can buy cheap head replacements off amazon too (they come in bulk for super cheap).
"
"
Bought this to replace the previous version with the dark blue handle that had three different speed settings, but the motor or battery started to die a slow death. This one only has one speed, but since my braces came off, it does the only function I need, a good cleaning.My oral health has been perfect since using the oral b brand sonic brushes with the precision clean heads. Would never go back to a regular toothbrush now except when I travel.
"
"
Pros:- Timer's very useful, made me pay more attention to how I brush- Brush motor is quite powerful- Induction charging is a neat feature for making the brush completely waterproof- Simple and intuitive to useCons:- Brush and charging cable are both too large to be travel friendly- Takes too long to charge fully (almost 2 days)Overall: Great brush! Would definitely recommend.
"
"
I bought this to replace a much older Oral B toothbrush that was beginning to wear out.  The old one was recommended by my dentist and I loved it.  So far, this newer brush performs as well as the older one, but with much better battery life (at least ten 4-minute brushings).
"
"
I like this toothbrush but for a couple minor things. The replacement heads are a bit pricey, the battery life isn't the best (I think I had to charge it every two days), and I found the vibration so powerful that I ultimately had to stop using it because it bothered my crown so much. Now, I have sensitive teeth - so this may not be the case for everyone. If you had sturdy teeth and minimal sensitivity, this may be the toothbrush for you. While I was using it, the dentist and dental hygienist did comment on how well it cleaned, particularly below the gum line.
"
"
I feel like my mouth is cleaner since I have this. Everyone should have one of those, it's SO superior to normal toothbrush! Only problem I have right now is the battery life, after a while the battery is noticeably oxidated and has to be recharged quite often.
"
"
I got this brush after doing a lot of research and am so pleased with my purchase. I have very sensitive gums so I was worried about it being too rough but the bristles are very soft and the motion isn't too aggressive. When I compare this to my old toothbrush (non-electric), I can tell you that my mouth feels so much cleaner now- and I was already doing a great job before. I feel like the toothbrush gets my teeth cleaner in half the time, and I have noticed less toothaches when eating sweets. Just awesome.
"
"
It's a good value for the price but if like me this is your first electric toothbrush be aware that the vibration will shake your jaw a lot. It does a good job with timing and cleaning but my jaw would get so sore when using it the first few weeks that I was going to give up on it. I built up enough tolerence now that it is ok. This may not be limited to this particular toothbrush.
"
"
Good electric toothbrush overall, but the feature that stop the brush every 30 seconds is actually annoying.  I also fear that it may reduce the product's durability. This is an example of companies offering features that actually diminish the value of the product.
"
"
Can't expect more compatible with all brush heads Oral B has to offer, not great for travelling though as the battery standby time is good 4 days the way I use i.e more than two minutes daily, as opposed to two minutes suggested from Oral-B.
"
"
My hygienist says that not only are my teeth in good shape but my gums as well - not bad for a senior citizen!  Two reasons I can think of.  The brush gets between the teeth to clean deep down.  The timer makes sure that I brush for 2 minutes.
"
"
This is a huge upgrade over the electric toothbrushes sold in drug stores, etc.  The feel alone is so much better but it makes way less noise and the 30 second intervals help ensure you're brushing all of your teeth for the right amount of time.  Plus it looks great with the black and white combination colour.
"
"
Feels like it is doing a decent job at cleaning. Brush head seemed large at first compared to my standard electric. Timer hesitation is nothing more than a gimmick and is very annoying, who needs to be told to move their toothbrush? Not a game changer, but an okay electric, at a decent price.
"
"
Works like a charm, such an instant relieve after you've brushed your teeth with this toothbrush, you can really feel the difference compared to any other regular brush. A must have product for those who enjoy keeping their teeth clean!
"
"
This brush is quite powerful and the battery lasts a long time on a single charge. The timer function is helpful and motivates you to brush for the recommended full two minutes. Doesn't come with a travelling case if you're looking to travel with it -- will have to purchase one or MacGyver something.
"
"
Im never going back to a manual toothrbsuh. Although it is pretty pricey, its worth the ammouunt of cavities you avoid! After the first use I ran my tongue over my teeth and they felt sooooo clean. However I wish there was a way to slow down the brushing, its a bit fast for me. Also theres a learning curve so after a 3 day period its easier. I like it tho!
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush for the price. I have always been interested in the market for an electric toothbrush, and this model is great for the novice. Simple to use, yet powerful to get your teeth squeaky clean. If you're skeptical of which one to buy, I definitely recommend the Oral-B Pro 1000. Cannot beat the price/value you get with this product.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush. Cleans well, but it gets a bit annoying with the pressure detection where it basically stops when you put too much pressure. It was definitely an adaptation from a manual brush but I definitely feel cleaner with this thing. Much easier to clean the back teeth more effectively, and it works pretty well on the tongue too!

I've had this tooth brush for a few years now and it's great. Use it twice a day and replace the head monthly. Does need to stay plugged in or battery goes dead sooner than later.The Oral-B is relatively cheap and gives you just what you need and that's it. I don't need all these different settings, fittings or Wi-Fi updates with my toothbrush. Just on and off, Listerine and some floss gets the job done.
"
"
Item was as described. The battery life is quite good. It does take a bit long to charge, however, it lasts long. The brushing motion feels good on the teeth, not too rough. I much prefer this toothbrush to a regular brush.
"
"
So far so good with this item. The first charge is only a week old, but the toothbrush is cleaning wonderfully, and doesn't bother the gums or cause any bleeding. The clean is much better than with a regular bristle brush
"
"
Love it Love Love it! Did i mentioned i love it?
"
"
Excellent!! Nous sommes 3 à l’utiliser. Nous faisons que changer la tête chaque fois. La batterie a une très bonne autonomie. J’adore la fonction de calcul de temps par quart de bouche. Je ne regrette pas dutout cet achat. Peut-être un peu bruyante si je veux absolument lui trouver un defaut!!
"
"
Not sure if it is TOO powerful, it is definitely more powerful then my last sonic toothbrush. Will look into buying a softer head for it. wouldn't recommend if this is your first power toothbrush, it might turn you off it. Leaves your teeth extremely clean though!
"
"
The toothbrush is so noisy, just like driving a old car.  The model is outdated. Short battery life and not comfortable when using.  I don’t recommend this product.  Better to spend little more money to buy sonicare.
"
"
My family and my dentist all raved about the electric toothbrushes, but I was stubborn and didn't want to spend the money, I wish I'd caved sooner. I finally gave in due to environmental problems of the amount of waste toothbrushes cause with the electric toothbrushes at the moment being more environmentally friendly.Pros:- teeth feel cleaner than ever- doesn't feel like i'm at dentist when I'm using it (what I thought it would feel like)- more environmentally friendly than non-electricCons:- my only con is that I wish that the heads you purchase for the toothbrush were recyclable. I would love to see Oral-B become one of the first companies to market such an item
"
"
This tooth brush is awesome. I was always convinced that an electric brush was the ""lazy way out"" but boy have I changed my mind. It really does clean much much better than a manual tooth brush, my teeth feel dentist clean everytime and I can noticeably feel the plaque removal. Very glad i switched.
"
"
I ordered this after receiving an email for a discount. It took a while to get here since they were sold out but once it got here it was worth it. I’ve been using it for 2 months now and I don’t know how I ever brushed my teeth before. My gums are sensitive and this doesn’t agitate them.
"
"
One of the best things I ordered from Amazon. There is such a difference between this and a manual toothbrush (and even from battery operated toothbrushes). Within 3 days, I noticed a significant difference. I ended up buying another one as a gift for the wife, it's that good. (Who would have thought of gifting toothbrushes, lol).
"
"
very good toothbrush, rechargeable is def the way to go.  Ease into the use tho, the starting brushhead is very stiff and will beat you gums up if you go cold turkey on your old toothbrush, ie, don't start with the 2min full on, try a combination of 30sec or so, finishing off with your old brush.  Another thing I noticed, is how much toothpaste I've been wasting, only needs a dime-size, not that inch-long line for the old toothbrush.
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush, I have very sensitive gums but have used it many times with no issue. The timer is well appreciated and the interchangeable heads is a great bonus, not to mention the whitening of the bristles with use to show wear, taking the guess work out of the useful life of a head.10/10 would buy more heads for.
"
"
I only get about 26 minutes out of this internal battery in this unit befor the red charging light comes on once I turn it off. I brush 2 times a day on averange for 2 1/2 minutes per brushing, that only guarantees 5 days on a change. So can't go on camping trips for more then 5 days without bringing a second unit or a battery pack to charge it up some.The unit is fairly quiet BUT, the brush head is very loud.The good, does a good job cleaning your teeth at least.
"
"
I REALLY love my new toothbrush! I've been using it for 3 months now and I can't believe I waited so long before taking the plunge and buying an electric toothbrush. Really good value for the money, no gimmicky features you won't use and leaves your teeth with a perfectly clean sensation.
"
"
Bon produit.Si vous voulez éviter le dentiste, un très bon achat.Pas beaucoup de fonction, elle brosse très bien, elle vibre quand ça fait 2 min.J’ai pas besoin d’avoir un GPS dans ma bouche.Donc, léger , brosse très bien comme on le souhaite pour une brosse électrique.Chez Oral-b meilleur rapport qualité vs prix.
"
"
simple to use , teeth feel super clean after use lasts well over 1 week between charges . not much more you can ask for in a toothbrush  . i can reccomend it  works well not to expensive trusted brand
"
"
My wife likes hers too... It's Like Running a Supercharged V8 In Your Mouth ! Charges up just fine and runs powerfully compared to my 8 year old unit. Very easy to hold. I'm pleased with this purchase.
"
"
After using a manual toothbrush all my life, this was quite a step up. When I finish brushing, there's a noticeable difference in how clean my teeth are (you can feel the difference) I'm very impressed with this brush.Thanks
"
"
The last one I bought wasn't the same model but same company. It still work fine except that the look is kind of old as I used many time for almost 15 years. The battery and motor still work fine.
"
"
Well, I purchased a pro 8000 and this one at the same time and well let me tell you this one is better since it worth the money you pay! the pressure sensor is a joke! it does not work at all...
"
"
Love It! Works Great and feels a lot cleaner after brushing my teeth. I have used it only for a few days  and loving it. My gums is not use to it but is now adjusting as it hurts at first maybe because of me putting so much pressure on it while brushing. I will but again
"
"
The battery on my old, VERY well-used toothbrush (plak control ultra in PINK) finally gave out this week so I started searching for a replacement brush. After using this type of brush I will never go back to traditional manual brushes - they just don't get into the nooks and crannies well enough.I placed my order at 11am Feb. 25th and my new brush was in my hands the very next morning - and I never pay extra for ""faster"" shipping! After charging this baby up I'm thoroughly enjoying brushing my teeth again, and the bonus is that it's quieter than the last one. Couldn't be happier!
"
"
Im extremely disappointed in this product. After three months of use the charger quit. I contacted the company and a lady told me there was no warranty. She gave me a part number and a we site to get a new one. The number she gave me was wrong and fortunately i caught it. I found the right product and ordered it only to find out after i ordered that there was huge shipping charges added later. The charger ended up costing me more than the whole unit combined. Not happy.
"
"
Works great but does sound loud & feels strong vibration. The pressure sensitivity does work if you push too hard.I only use it once a day. Not comfortable  using it for every brushing.  Worried it may be too aggressive.But works like it states.
"
"
What can I say.  It works.  Weird thing is that every unit I have will stall for 1/4 second after about 20 seconds of brushing.  Is that some sort of timer to tell me how long I am brushing?  I didn't bother with the instructions.  Battery needs a recharge maybe every week or so brushing twice a day.

Have only used OralB electric toothbrushes, and have always had great results at the dentist (like a major drop in plaque, to almost none).  New smaller base makes it easier to travel with when gone for more than a week, otherwise I only bring the brush.
"
"
I bought the Oral B Pro 1000 toothbrush based on the fact I had an Oral B brush.  This toothbrush is so much more powerful than my old one.  I like the larger brush head.  It does an amazing job cleaning my teeth.  I would recommend this brush.
"
"
I'm happy with my Oral B I'm not sure about setting up the signals for different times of brushing or is that automatically I'm not sure but yeah I'm happy with its powerful it's quiet I'm waiting for it to completely charge it keeps on flashing green I'm not sure why anyways I'm happy with the product it's October 11th was she in the difference in a month or two.
"
"
I had an Oral-B electric toothbrush for approximately 15 years before it died. As I was quite satisfied with the performance of that brush, I decided to stick with the brand for my replacement. This electric toothbrush does not disappoint! I find it more powerful and I'm getting a much better clean with less effort. The timer function is great and the design is sleek and clean, with a smaller base than my older model. I would definitely recommend!
"
"
Excellent product with great battery life! Does what it's supposed to do i.e. the brushing... would recommend to anyone who is a newbie for electronic toothbrushes. Bought it on black Friday so got an excellent product with great value for money.Tip: if you are a couple buy one device and two tooth brushes. Can interchange the brushes on the same device.
"
"
It’s good but too hard bristles. I was using sonic before and I liked it better. Plus sonic stops at two minutes and if you want to extend the time, you switch it on again. This one does not stop at two minutes but just makes it slower
"
"
Fonctionne très bien. Il y manque qu un case pour le voyage car pas pratique ( hygiène ). Pour le reste parfait. Ils auraient pu en fournir un en plastique pour dépanner !
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I love it. My teeth seem very clean and whiter than usualand my head is not vibrated abnormally! There are no bells or whistles on this model; no 30 second beeper, no slower or faster mode, etc. If you are looking for extra features, then model up.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush. I'm terribly missing a timer feature. It's not very good for traveling though, because when I take the head part off, it doesn't same much time and I couldn't find appropriate box to put the whole thing in to not damage the brush
"
"
I love this toothbrush! My old Oral B electric lasted a lot of years so it’s retirement was due. This new one is better because it gives me a warning at 30 seconds and also at 2 minutes to ensure I brush my teeth thoroughly! Takes the guess work out of oral hygiene.
"
"
Tried others in the past and will only use Oral-B now.  Had my last Oral-B for a long time so really happy with its durability and when this one is done I will buy the same one again.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush. The built in timer is my favourite thing. Recommended by my dentist. Best bang for the buck. Don't waste your time with really expensive electronic toothbrushes as this has everything you need!
"
"
Shipment was delayed and lost. Until I write to Amazon asking for shipment update, Amazon placed with a replacement order and I got the shipment in a couple days after that.  Oral B Pro 1000 Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush is the best one. I am happy with it and recommend for everyone who loves powered toothbrush.
"
"
This product is great for everyday use. I have to charge it about once every 4 days or so but it really cleans your teeth well. I find that when the battery life starts to flash, you still have about 1 good use in before it dies. overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.
"
"
I bought this as a replacement for my 20 year old oral b. I love it... I really like the 30 sec reminder to go to another area for brushing. Its louder than my old one but its not a big deal.
"
"
This toothbrush does an excellent job.  My partner recently purchased an electric toothbrush and after trying his with a different brush of course I decided to purchase one of my own. After some research, I decided to get Oral B 1000, the price was affordable and it was adaptable for a variety of brushes and now my husband uses mine, of course with a different brush as I had purchased a package of brushes. We're pretty happy with my choice.
"
"
Why did I wait so long to get an electric toothbrush I have no idea!!!!  Love having it.  It has a 30 second timer to remind you to move to the next section of your mouth.  Very helpful.
"
"
-The vibration is way too strong for sensitive gums...and it's sooo loud!! I've always had oral b brushes, I'm really disappointed with this one.-False claims:1)""Senses when you brush too hard with pressure sensor"" doesn't exist on this toothbrush!!2)""In-handle timer pulses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch areas of the mouth"" doesn't exist on this toothbrush!!
"
"
It’s been a little over a month since receiving this product and it’s  my second time charging this electric toothbrush on the docking station it was provided with and now  it does not work anymore.  I would not recommend as it’s just a waste of money 💲I only give it two star rating as the shipping was quick
"
"
Doesn't have all the bells and whistles that the expensive options have (ie. bluetooth, timers etc.) but it has a sensor that stops the toothbrush from spinning if you're applying too much pressure which is the biggest plus for me as I was wrecking my gums using a manual brush before.  Haven't tested how long a charge works since I put it on the charger every night but so far no complaints and I am very satisfied.  Easy enough to find generic brand heads if you don't need any specialized options.
"
"
Dont buy this product - The Battery dies in 2/3 months or after the warrantyI had it exchanged and the second unit battery died too.I wont buy this one again, will try something different.
"
"
It's a better brushing experience, it just does a better job than you can do with a manual toothbrush.  The only con is it is a bit loud and would be nice if it came with a travel case but for the price it's well worth it.
"
"
Its good for the price.. not a lot of functions but its a toothbrush...I know it does does the job better than my manual that's for sure.Merci,
"
"
I read other reviews with negatives about how loud this is.  It's not.  I am unsure how quiet people want it, but it is just fine.  Teeth feel great after using this brush.
"
"
Needed a new electric toothbrush and came across this one.Love the new features it has compared to my old one, easy to use, compact and the battery lasts a lot longer!Thinking about purchasing one for my husband now!
"
"
Bought this toothbrush back in December. Currently using it as my daily tooth brush. This toothbrush is definitely an upgrade from my old standerd toothbrush and it seems to be doing a better job than my old toothbrush use to do. My teeth seem to be whiter and brighter.1 Negative. Charging the toothbrush is a pain in the butt, but it's worth it.
"
"
Great toothbrush, decided to buy an electric toothbrush and went with amazons recommendation. dont think ill ever go back to a manual toothbrush, it leaves teeth feeling smoother and smile slowly got whiter
"
"
I can't believe how noisy the 1000 is, average of 68 decibels. That's the same as a regular conversation. Not what I want before bed.The package states the bristles are soft, they are not anywhere near what my dentist gives me as a soft toothbrush.Other than these two issues, I would say the product is good. I would rather upgrade to a better model or go back to my Sonic
"
"
Great toothbrush! I love the timer function and my mouth feels very clean! Brush replacements are reasonably priced and i enjoy using this! Great value for your money!
"
"
Got this on sale and it's working as well as I had hoped. I could do without the 30 second buzzing feature, as it makes me feel like I have to rush.. but I suppose it helps make sure I'm not brushing for too long. It's easy to clean and take apart and holds a charge really well.
"
"
I'm loving my new electric toothbrush. It makes your teeth feel really clean and the timer function helps you know how long you need to brush. I love it!
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and it works great. The battery lasts for a very long time, and the motor produces enough power to really clean your teeth. I've definitely noticed a change in the color of my teeth since i started using this 6 months ago. The only con is that it can be messy, and you have to clean the base quite often unless you like having blue gunk on it.
"
"
Love the toothbrush and would buy again.  The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found that it needs to be recharged after two days.  To fully recharge  takes up to 12 hours.  Thank You
"
"
My first time purchasing an ""expensive"" electric toothbrush. I like this brush a lot. The small head makes it easy to maneuver and the 30 second pulses reminder really helps you with timing. No complaints!
"
"
She likes it a lot, I have a different model but does basically the same thing, say goodbye to those fuzzy slippers on your teeth, and say hello to those pearls
"
"
I’ve been using these brushes for 15 years now. Got it recently, and so far batteries lasting at least a week. I was a little worried that it was too strong but then I changed the brush head that came with it for the Percision clean brush head (softer) and now it’s just perfect
"
"
Great toothbrush, although it is very loud and a bit too crazy fast when it spins but I'm sure it's doing a great job cleaning my teeth at the same time.
"
"
I love brushing my teeth now?This makes my teeth and mouth feel so clean, it is so quick and easy to use and clean, and I can't imagine going back to a regular toothbrush now! I used to think electric toothbrushes were a gimmicky money grab, but... well, I'm converted.
"
"
Bought this as a wanted xmas gift for my 8 years old. No hassles to brush his anymore. I have ordered replacement heads so I can use it also. Cleans teeth very well. I haven't seen his teeth so clean after he's brushed unless I have done it myself, but this little machine makes his mouth look fresh from the dentist.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and my teeth fee 10X cleaner. Since using my dentist also noticed improvements in less plaque.Only downside is the base gets “scum” build up from salvia/water dripping through. I clean my holder every 2 days but wish it had a better drain system.
"
"
My wife and I both have one of these and they work great!  Very easy to use, never have battery issues and definitely prefer it over non electric store bought tooth brushes.
"
"
The timer is useful. I do not love electric toothbrushes at the best of times, but this is a reasonable volume and holds its charge well. My husband finds his impossible to keep clean, but if you rinse it well after every use you should be fine.
"
"
The motor is too weak, I like the weight, size and is black, but is the motor is not powerful enough, I feel I need to spend more time on each teeth, not recommended.
"
"
Great toothbrush, I know its the base model so its a bit louder than the other models. But my teeth have never felt so clean and it definitely gives the best plaque removal. Slim enough to travel with or pack away.
"
"
Super nice brush! My siblings got the Oral B 7000, but after using this one I feel like its more bang for the buck than the 7000. Makes brushing fun and something to look forward to and the timing system helps you keep an even brush to each mouth quadrant.
"
"
I got this Myself but then my girlfriend took it because I wanted the Oral-B 7000 I think it’s a really good toothbrush for people who have never had any other electric toothbrush it’s pretty excellent way better than manual and Oral-B is making top-of-the-line stuff so I would I would if you want the cheap brand I would invest into this
"
"
Works wellBattery life is greatEasy to useCharges quicklyWill get mouldy under the head due to moisture leakage
"
"
This is a great tooth brush, has alot of power to it for my teeth. The vibration is heavy, the batter power indent know because I always have it plugged in.
"
"
My dentist said I had gingivitis and that I should try using an electric toothbrush as it does a better job of cleaning around the gumline. Within a month, I noticed drastic improvements and my teeth feel much cleaner and it seems like I no longer have gingivitis because my gums are no longer super red or bleeding!
"
"
Great toothbrush. Head is a bit large to reach my wisdom teeth (yes I still have all 4) but no different than a regular brush.Only disadvantage is when you place it back on the charge station, after a few days of it drying off (and dripping to the base) it can get sticky ... simple wipe with water fixes it. Not a big issue.
"
"
Best toothbrush I have ever purchased.... it's definitely wOrth the money and you can really tell the difference coming from a.low priced electric toothbrush or standard tooth brush
"
"
It's a good toothbrush and I am pretty impressed with its performance.Two things which are bothering me a bit :1. There is no pressure sensor in this toothbrush, as it was advertised in its description2. The toothbrush head which you will receive in the box has hard bristles and may cause bleeding in gums. Mine are sensitive though. For better results, you need to pay extra for good quality brush heads with soft bristles.
"
"
The toothbrush has long-lasting battery life and feels good after a fresh charge. Although, the brush does stutter every now and then and happens often but only lasts 2-3 seconds. Overall a great investment and I'm very happy with the product and recommend it to anyone whos looking to buy an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Lol a little aggressive at first bc I was used to using a manual brush but I really love this toothbrush! The head on it is perfect for getting under my retainer wire and cleaning those pearly whites!
"
"
bought this for our son and he likes it better then a manual toothbrush and he likes the color of it hopefully he has it for some time .
"
"
Works good! Teeth feel very clean and polished just like I got back from dentist. This one pulses as you go to tell you to move to next row of teeth.
"
"
I have been using it for some time and it has worked very well. No issues yet.  I like the 30 second pulse notice, so you can switch to the 1/4 of your mouth.
"
"
I purchased this end of Nov 2019 and it was working fine until one day (a little more than 3 months later), after charging, it just no longer works. The charging light will still light up but the toothbrush itself does not function anymore. After reading other reviews, this seem to happen often. Definitely not worth the price.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is great and does a really good job at cleaning, especially around the teeth and gum line. My only issue with this toothbrush is that the timer does not work at all. It just stays on. Not a major issue, but felt like I should mention it. I'm giving it 3 stars because it is a bit pricey and the timer is a small issue.
"
"
I had to replace my Oral B that was at least 10 or 15 years old. This one works beautifully, nice and strong battery and my teeth feel amazing!
"
"
Very nice! Really impressed with this toothbrush! Does a great job and looks nice too! My teeth are already whiter and brighter in less than a week. Would definitely buy again!
"
"
My dental hygienist recommended this toothbrush and I can already feel the difference! We'll wait and see if it improves my next check up but my guns are already feeling better sounds using it
"
"
Purchased couple of these for my children a very long time ago (well over a year or two) and they are abused like children tend to do with things, but still working just like new.
"
"
We bought this as a birthday gift for our grandson and so we haven't opened it.  I do have to say however, that my husband and I have had two Oral-B electric toothbrushes and they have been excellent.  So we are expecting that this one will be great too.
"
"
It’s working very well, I don’t like the plastic part of the  handle, I find it slippery, the rubber part is good. They could’ve done a better job on the handle.
"
"
I've returned to the dentist's office twice since buying this tooth brush. Both visit were problem-free. The hygenist tells me ""Great job!"". So it must be good.
"
"
So far so good. Had almost the same one for 15 years. Lithium power is better than the old NiMH ones. I would have preferred the option of a docking system like my old one where I can wall mount it and store things along with the power unit.
"
"
Ok but motor does power down and drag when any pressure applied between brush head and tooth, when your tring to clean something out from between teeth
"
"
Really annoying. It can be used only for 2 mins even though it is being plugged in 24/7. Basically only one person can use the brush in the morning.  For the other family members, we all have to buy separate electric tooth brush? Really? Very upset with the buy. They should recall this product.
"
"
First time switching from manual to electric tooth brush. Once I got used to the sensation, I really liked using this over my old toothbrush. It's a lot more lightweight than I expected, and it leaves a fairly small footprint on the bathroom counter with its charging stand. No complaints at all really. The description accurately describes what you're getting. Would definitely recommend.
"
"
There are kids versions of electric toothbrushes but really when their first teeth fall out they have adult teeth and should be brushing well. This electric brush helps kids brush each tooth one at a time and much better than a manual or children's back and forth style electric. Light enough for a 8 year old to handle.
"
"
Timer function ?? My dentist was very pleased with my last checkup and I attribute it, in part, to the use of this toothbrush.
"
"
Makes brushing allot easier and is absolutely worth it. If you have never used electrics this powerful I would recommend starting with softer heads.
"
"
Excellent product. I was hesitant about investing in an electric toothbrush but I’m so glad I did.The timer function is awesome. And I was surprised that the standard toothbrush head it comes with works well for me, even though I have sensitive teeth. Very happy with this.
"
"
Works, as advertised except the battery, died after 10 uses when it's advertised to work for 20 uses. I need it to work for a longer period of time in order to travel.
"
"
I am not the kind of person to spend a lot of money on a toothbrush. This one is absolutly worth it if you're looking for a toothbrush that is not expansive while sill doing what a toothbrush is supposed to do, no more no less. If you're still using a manuel toothbrush, you'll feel a big change immediately after the first brush with this one. It really does remove plaque and whitens teeth. Worth it.
"
"
I strongly recommend you only buy an electric toothbrush with a lithium battery. No memory effect and much more brushes per charge. I bought this to replace a working Oral-B with a fading nicad battery. One of the least expensive but it gets the job done.
"
"
It performs very well, although this product can go even cheaper. I felt it is a bit expensive. The brush head is really thick compares to other brushes. The weight of the machine is very light. Therefore, this is a good product!
"
"
Bought this on sale. Months later I am still happy with this brush. Has a 30 second buz that goes off to let you know you can move to the next section to clean if you want to use it. Battery lasts a long time before needing a charge and is usually fully charged by next use.
"
"
Great tooth brush I had an older model that was wearing out, so I expected the same but oral b really improved the motor and is much better than the 12 year old brush I was using. I would recommend this to anyone. After using it I feel I was just at the dentist.
"
"
Bought it to replace my old unit which died after a decade. Price was low, reviews so-so. For me the unit works well. Recommend recharging after each use as it does take a long time to charge.
"
"
These features never work --- ""A helpful on‐handle timer buzzes every 30 seconds to let you know when it’s time to focus on brushing the next quadrant of your mouth. The brush also alerts you when you have brushed for the dentist‐recommended time of 2 minutes.""
"
"
Cleanest my teeth have ever felt, but the bush heads themselves get all gummed up with goop if you are not meticulous with the clean up..... so two minutes to brush up and two minutes to clean up. Other than that GREAT!
"
"
The first time I bought this toothbrush 5 years ago, the battery would last a week before needing to be charged. The latest version of this toothbrush has a terrible battery. It last at most 3 days and starts to slow down significantly after just a day. When it works, it does an excellent job brushing your teeth. Made a huge difference to my gums.
"
"
Ordered this product specifically as I am a fan of Oral B products.  Took a long time to charge at first (22hours).  Will be interesting to see how long the charge lasts and how long the re-charge takes.
"
"
Saved a ton by buying it on Amazon prime day!  It’s a great tooth brush, good battery life, also ordered more heads from amazon too!  Way cheaper.
"
"
Feels wierd at first but love it.  Makes my teeth feel really clean.  Would like to have seen a container to snap over the bristles, but can remedy that by buying one at my local dollar store.  Nice look and weight.
"
"
Makes my mouth feel clean and fresh after use. Timer function is incredibly useful, even when I use a regular tooth brush now I feel like I'm brushing for longer. No complaints!
"
"
Braun is the one i am using for last 16 years. I have used about three different heads in 16 years. I don't see i will ever go back.Also, i got my rebate from P&G on this purchase. These things last for long time. Brush heads, in only buy genuine in market so i can stay good with this one.
"
"
I liked the speed of this model as well as the cross action brush head.  I love the timer function which lets you know when it's time to switch sides for a better cleaning and the battery life is long, I've only had to charge it twice since I received it and that's using it twice a day.
"
"
This unit is not worth purchasing! The batter had trouble charging for the beginning, it would slow down in uses and after two weeks the unit will not charge at all. Don't waste your money.
"
"
Works but makes a lot if noise and appears aggressive on the teeth. I've bought oral b before and none of them operated like this. Disappointed
"
"
A full charge lasts me for 1.5 weeks without needing to recharge. Making the switch from a regular old toothbrush to and electric toothbrush I can’t imagine going back. My dentist typically tells me to floss more and ever since I started using I haven’t gotten that comment. Like it so much I ended up buying one for each one of my family member.
"
"
Don't like this thing at all. Threw it out, brushes get nasty fast, expensive replacements. Bought a sonicare works way better

Simple yet effective. I did a search on an product review website called Wirecutter and they selected the Oral B-Pro 1000 as they best toothbrush and offered the most value. In addition,  Amazon also has the best price!
"
"
Good product for the price but I find that it needs charging often like every 2 days.I had other Oral B before and it seems that I didn't charge the toothbrush that often for the same daily usage.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Easy to use and holds the charge.  Cleans teeth and gum area just like going to the dentist.  Love it
"
"
Battery does not last long, needs recharging every 3-4 days, after use by two people twice a day.Should last longer!
"
"
I previously bought a philips essence toothbrush and was NOT happy with it so bought this one instead. It is AMAZING. I highly recommend it. You can immediately feel that it has done a good job.
"
"
Excellent unit, my previous one lasted over 10 years
"
"
Very impressed with this toothbrush..1st time user of a electric ...65 years old and should of bought this brush years ago. Brush once a day, I should do more.
"
"
My  teeth and gums feel so clean after using this. Feels like it is giving my gums a massage. I like how it automatically stops turning if you apply too much pressure. My teethe and health are going to benefit from this investment.
"
"
Fantastic tooth brush! The color is great!
"
"
Bought for Christmas gifts. My wife and I have these and they work great. Teeth always feel clean.
"
"
Charger stopped working after 3 weeks...must have been faulty.For the list price its expensive...you can get two for this price elsewhere...
"
"
Great brush! Don't find the vibrations too crazy for my teeth or gums. Glad I made the switch from manual to this electric toothbrush. I also find the toothbrush head a great size for teeth. The larger heads seem as they won't clean the individual tooth as intensively.
"
"
Very good and the time function lets you know when you can change the sides. It is also light weight as well.
"
"
Bought this for my dad and he loves it. He keeps telling me it’s the best!
"
"
I am very happy with my purchase. It is replacement. It is more powerful than the previous model. I can really feel the difference. It will be confirmed at the teeth cleaning.
"
"
this is a great unit,  timer function is great, battery life lasts at least a week,  does an amazing job,  feels like you just left the dentist.
"
"
After charging the battery for a long time, I pressed the button for about 30 seconds, the machine stopped working. There was only a moaning hum, not working at all. Very disappointed. I think I have to return it if it doesn't get better. Out of mood with Oral b products.
"
"
I use it every day. The only thing is for the price of it they should inclue a couple different brushes.
"
"
Bought as a gift. Came quickly and was well received. The giftee loves it and says it works great.
"
"
great product, battery charging wireless---> less concern for electronic shock. charged overnight and used very well with strong rotation.
"
"
Great price and so far has worked great. This is the first electric Toothbrush I've owned and it's weight and feel of quality was better than I was expecting. I can honestly tell the difference, my teeth are cleaner and whiter already versus the manual brushes I have always used.
"
"
Had a sonic unit before this one, after 8 years it dies.  I don't think this one, Sounds like it's using marbles to brush my teeth.  Just bought a new Sonic unit to replace this after less than 30 days.
"
"
This toothbrush is nice, but it won't turn on anymore and I've only had it since March 1st. It seems to charge fine, but nothing happens when I press the power button now. Return window closed a week ago... Definitely not worth the money if this is the norm.
"
"
comparing with normal toothbrush this is way better, can't tell about other brand/kind.Did not try to travel with it.
"
"
This tooth brush does not hold a charge. Feels like its going to die out after 60 seconds. I've had many oral b power brushes never one as terrible as this one. I do not recommend buying this model
"
"
Works great, love the timer. And it feels like ive gone to the dentist every time i use it
"
"
The pulse every 30 seconds to let you know to change areas is a great feature that my previous electric toothbrush didn't have. Stays charged for about a week and I haven't noticed a drop in performance throughout that week. The large brush head is something else I liked. Brush heads are much cheaper for this model than my other toothbrush. Unfortunately 8 or 9 hours isn't enough to reach a full charge. Altogether a great product, much better than my previous that costed more.
"
"
Great product and works well. It's been really reliable and the charge lasts quite awhile. The price was good.
"
"
Takes around 12-14 hours or more to get a full charge. That is my only drawback. Perfect toothbrush!
"
"
Great brush. My husband really feels the difference in clean using this. The 20 second timer helps keep track of where you're brushing. It's functional and compact. The charging base doesn't take up much room.
"
"
J aime vraiment! C est vrai que les dents sont bcp plus propres. La seule option qui manque est le détecteur de pression, mais il faut juste penser à laisser la brosse à dent travailler seule mais mettre de pression. Go for it
"
"
It took a bit of getting used to since I was pressing the brush too hard against my teeth but now I like it.  No problems.  Haven't used the timer function very often.
"
"
Love this toothbrush .... lots of power , will get any bits of food trap in your teeth or gums . Also notice how clean it makes your teeth as well . The battery life is super long before needing to charge it again.
"
"
Ça semble un bon produit! Acheté pour donner en cadeau de noël donc pas encore utilisé!
"
"
LOVE this toothbrush! I was debating going for a higher end one but this one does everything I need it to. Two pulses and you know to switch quadrants, 4 pulses and you've brushed for 2 minutes.Gives an amazing clean mouth feeling!!
"
"
About 3 months after I bought it, it started to smell burnt. No amount of type of cleaning can get the smell out, so I wonder if it is a motor issue.
"
"
This toothbrush really rattles and shakes the whole handle and everything.  I've had other brands where the head vibrated very fast but was quiet and the whole thing did not rattle.  Would not buy again.
"
"
I finally switched to an electric toothbrush and I'm not going back. Great price and exactly what I needed
"
"
Jusqu’à maintenant je ne suis pas déçu! Acheté depuis quelques mois et le produit fonctionne très bien
"
"
So a thing with this toothbrush is that you have to push it in very hard into the charging port otherwise it will only give bursts of charge to the toothbrush which will shortcircuit it. It’s a really crappy design flaw really and I wish I could return this for a new one...
"
"
I replaced my old Oral B Pro when the battery faded after many years of service.  This new Oral B Pro 1000 can last a week (2 to 3 times daily use).  It cleans very well and I haven't had any issues with it for the past few weeks.
"
"
Très satisfaite de l'achat de ma première brosse à dent électrique.. Parfait pour débutant.. Procure un nettoyage impeccable!
"
"
Does exactly what it says. Been using it for slightly over a month and think it's one of the best automatic brushes I've used.
"
"
Took a while to charge, but all in all the product does what I expected.  It could use a pointed brush to complete the set of brushes which I also ordered.
"
"
Pour ce prix j'ai vraiment limpression que ma bouche est beaucoup plus propre qune brosse a dent electrique jetable
"
"
I had to replace my Oral-B electric toothbrush recently after using it for many years. They are excellent quality and last for a long time. Happy Amazon delivered it in no time at all. I missed it for even a few days.
"
"
Très efficace cette brosse à dents électrique.  Très satisfait de ma commande.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. I like the timer function - it makes brushing my teeth seem to take less time. Really powerful toothbrush, you dont need to apply any pressure really.
"
"
Works great and your teeth feel even better. Battery life is roughly a week brushing twice a day. Maybe less. Bought a second one for a gift
"
"
Extremely loud and horrible vibration on my teeth while cleaning.. I can barely stand it even with the slightest pressure. I’m sure regular use would lead to receding gums. Expensive for what it is... my boyfriend bought a less expensive which was far better.
"
"
Works really well.  The toothbrush indicates when to move on to the next area.  Lets you know when 2 minutes is up.
"
"
First electric toothbrush so not much to compare to, however this device is way to loud and feels clunky. The brush head is too wide and brushes my gums causing them to bleed every time. For 39.99 (Black Friday) you can’t go wrong but personally speaking I would’ve opted for something a little more expensive for the better quality
"
"
After extensive research, it turns our this toothbrush looked like the best bang for my bucks. After several weeks giving it a test drive, I must say it does the job consistantly with great results. Other Oral-B will basically do the same things, with more bells and whisles, but for a steeper price.
"
"
Inductive Charging is nice. Replacement heads are expensive, so I will try the OEM heads.
"
"
I do not think these are worth the price they are able to charge but I am very pleased with the results as the plaque between my teeth has completely gone.
"
"
The mechanism works well for cleaning and the timer is really nice for taking the guesswork out of spending an equal amount of time in each quadrant.Electric >>>> Manual toothbrushes all day
"
"
Shipping rapide. Produit impeccable que j'ai réussi à payer 40% moins cher au black Friday.
"
"
Great toothbrush! Tàkes a little getting used to in the beginning! Works great otherwise!
"
"
Has great power compared to the disposable battery version. Worth the price. I wish I could turn the timer off.
"
"
tres bon achat,  on ne peut plus s en passer, la pile dure 7 jours, ensuite, on le replace quelques heures sur la charge et c est reparti pour une autre semaine ;)
"
"
she likes it so far.. bought for her because she brushes her teeth too hard and thus is slowly getting receding gumline
"
"
Not quite sure this has a timer. Would not use timer anýway.Battery seems to lose power quickly...
"
"
Item arrived and is charging on the fourth day now, still blinking and cannot turn on since its still charging. Hope this is a defect that can be fixed
"
"
Very disappointed in this product. The toothbrush is advertised as having ""the pressure sensor stops the pulsation movement if you brush too hard"", NO such function exists. You can press as hard as you can and the pulsation will not stop. DO NOT buy this product if you're buying for the pressure sensor claim.
"
"
I like that it is light weight and less bulky than other brush heads.
"
"
Seems to do the trick. Bought for my boyfriend  he has no complaints.
"
"
Gives you a similar clean feeling as a visit to the dental hygienist. Don’t need all the bells and whistles of the higher models.
"
"
Great toothbrush and lasts a long time. I don't have to constantly charge the battery.  Also it's easy to carry around if you want to travel with it. Does not take up a lot of space in the bathroom.
"
"
My old electric toothbrush died and I ordered this one. Takes up very little room and works very well, very strong vibration
"
"
Dans un premier temps, on m’a envoyé une brosse défectueuse, je leur ai juste écrit pour leur expliquer l’anomalie; et on m’a renvoyé une autre avant même que je retourne la première. Et je suis vraiment satisfait.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush.. definitely enjoy the upgrade!The timer is so useful also...my teeth always feel squeaky clean after using it !
"
"
Used it in the past few days! works great! love it!Not sure about battery life but timer functions well! every 30s and after 2m it gives a vibration
"
"
Great upgrade from my older oral b. Much stronger and leaves my mouth feeling good and clean
"
"
Great toothbrush, powerful and cleans wellGreat pricing as well
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It vibrates to let you know 30 seconds is up and move to a different area. I like the fact you don't have to leave it on a chrger. I love the way my teeth and and mouth feel after brushing.
"
"
Works great after a couple of months. I'm glad I switched from a manual and this seems to be a competitive option, especially if you pick it up on sale.
"
"
This was a Christmas gift to myself. I love it. The timer function is helpful.
"
"
Works well... but either my battery is dead upon delivery or my charger is broken... barely lasts one tooth brush session before it dies !
"
"
Was just what I ordered. The only issue I had was the package contained a discount coupon for replacement brush heads. The coupon had an expiry date of July, 2018. My purchase date was October, 2019.
"
"
After several months of use the battery life is much better than it first was. Good quality product.
"
"
Fabulous.  My teeth feel cleaner already.  My first Braun lasted well past 10 years.  Like the new timing concept of 30s for each quadrant.  Great quality product.
"
"
battery died and will not recharge after just a couple of uses.
"
"
been using this product for a few years with aftermarket heads, works great
"
"
Works great cleaning wise. Green light kept flashing for days. Sent it back.
"
"
Love that it Let’s you know when you have reached two minutes!
"
"
Great Product ! The reason why I have given 4 Stars is because of Battery charge. The battery of this brush doesn’t hold charge for more than 3 days even if its fully charged.
"
"
I like this product .The brand says a lot - easy to clean, easy to charge , and easy to use . Wanting to buy more for my family
"
"
My teeth are super clean now and i use to have lots of problems with my teeth
"
"
Would not take a charge from day one.Threw away the box so cant return.Don't throw away your money buying from this seller.Get it locally so you can take it back if you have to.
"
"
Sleek look with the black. Always keep on the base so can’t speak to battery life while traveling. Clean feeling just like coming from the dentist
"
"
I was thinking of buying a more expensive one, but I have decided to buy it. I am happy about it. It gives a vibration every 30 seconds. It's a useful toothbrush
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Works great.  Mouth feels way cleaner after using this
"
"
AThis electric tooth brush works great and exactly as advertised. A great product and great value.
"
"
Timer is pretty quiet, battery lasts about a week, wish a travel case would of came with it. Good deal still.
"
"
Bon produit, le calcaire reste apparent sur le noir mais se lave bien
"
"
Ceci est ma première brosse à dent électrique. Après une semaine d'utilisation, je suis très satisfait du résultat. Mon seul regret est de ne pas en avoir acheté une avant.
"
"
I’m loving this toothbrush! It has a timer for each area of your mouth. Feels super clean after wards!
"
"
Teeth feel thoroughly clean and fresh after use. I would not see any reason to upgrade to a more expensive model. I find the timer slightly annoying but that’s just me. Overall a great purchase, would buy again and would recommend.
"
"
As advertised, with Prime was overnight shipped. Great to use.Much better than my older one. Wouldrecommend.
"
"
Its perfect! Got it for my sister because she loves clean teeth and this works so good!
"
"
La brosse ne s'arrête pas lorsqu'on appuie fortement .... une seule vitesse plutôt décue
"
"
Mon fils est très heureux..ENFIN une brosse à dent électrique !!
"
"
not worth the extra money. they talk bought features but are not included in the product. should have bought the cheaper model would have the same tooth brush and 30 dollars extra in my pocket.
"
"
A simple and effective brush that won't break the bank. Efficient and easy to use. Battery lasts a few days. If you're traveling on a short trip, you don't have to bring the charger.
"
"
Does the cleaning job pretty well. A bit noisy, but because it cleans well I gave it 5 stars!
"
"
This toothbrush has pretty much no features. It is as basic as it gets. I would not buy again.
"
"
I have only had this item for a short time so cannot say how well the battery lasts etc. I willtell you it cleans  much better then a manual brush. Love it!
"
"
It’s great. My teeth feel clean after using. The only negative thing is that it doesn’t come with a travel case or a cover which my previous toothbrush had.
"
"
This one is way better than our earlier model ones from 5 years ago. Huge performance improvement.
"
"
Makes brushing my teeth less of a hassle. No bells and whistles here, though I wish I could at least change the speed. I'm gonna need to get the soft bristle tips.
"
"
It's loud. Not ideal when trying to brush your teeth while someone is sleeping nearby.
"
"
Battery life isn't 40 minutes doesn't last 10 days. Probably about a week. Timer function doesn't reset and carrys over to your next brushing session. Hard to time for 2 minutes if you didn't finish the last one right on time.
"
"
Nothing really to comment on, it does what it sets out to do and does well at it. Overall no huge complaints.
"
"
Right after I bought this, I found that Costco is on sale for PRO 2000. It is even cheaper than this.
"
"
I've had my brush for a few days and quickly realized that even after charging it all day,  I can barely get 2 mins of brushing time.... So...  Not even close the advertised 7 days. Not sure what to do,  it's super limiting.
"
"
Feels like a dentist clean. This toothbrush is powerful af. So powerful it makes your eyeballs jiggle a lil, but it gives a good brushin for sure.
"
"
Love it, can't live without it. It helps oral hygiene
"
"
Battery lasts a long time between charges. Noticeably whiter teeth!
"
"
I had ordered 2 of them,  they are a great product
"
"
Je l’ai acheté en cadeau à ma mère et elle ne peut plus s’en passer tellement elle l’aime.
"
"
Best tooth brush I’ve ever bought ! Teeth feel Like I just left the dentist ! Amazing price ! Haven’t used the timer function. Battery has lasted over 7 days.
"
"
The twirly brush heads for plaque removing is so much more effective than my old Philips Sonicare. Two weeks in and I’m seeing a huge difference it’s making.
"
"
Been using this product for 3 weeks now and my gums feel well brushed and the round brush head reaches places a normal toothbrush can’t. Overall way better than standard toothbrush however battery life is tricky.
"
"
Love it, I have one myself and had bought these for my kids for their birthdays, they really like them also
"
"
Avait déjà une à la maison. Je l'ai acheté pour ma conjointe. 2 clients satisfaits.
"
"
This was my 1st electric toothbrush. I am very pleased with how well it cleans my teeth. My teeth feel professionally cleaned after each use. I also find I take more time brushing which is beneficial for my oral health.Will continue to always using an electric toothbrush.
"
"
I ordered a new brush and ut worked great for 20 day's. Suddenly the battery started to die so fast. I remember the first time I used it and it worked for like a week and now it hardly works for a day.
"
"
Très bon produit, brosse facile a trouver par la suite.
"
"
Everything was ok except it did not signal when 30 secs passed as it was advertised.
"
"
Awesome product, works extremely well, night and day when switching from a regular tooth brush.
"
"
It's an oral b, the best. Great price and does a great job.
"
"
Before this one i had the Vitality, but this one is so much better......I find it cleans alot better.....and the battery lasts longer...so it was work paying the little extra.
"
"
i love the product, using this kind of product O-B toothbrushes for many years but this one i got dose not charge fully always blinking, I am not happy about that, beside this I really like the product
"
"
Great quality for the price! Highly recommended!
"
"
I now brush mt teeth twice a day because of the speed, and convenience.  Like it a lot.
"
"
Je suis vraiment heureuse de mon achats, j’ai toujours pris soin de mes dents puis avec cette brosse à dent électrique mes dents sont impeccable 👌🏻
"
"
This is a great brush with lots of power and battery. I was disappointed when receiving the unit that there was only one head in the package, not even one spare.
"
"
The battery lasts a long time before having to recharge and is compatible with other chargers or brush heads....recommended
"
"
My daughter has braces and her orthodontist recommended using an electric toothbrush. I checked reviews of different ones available in the market and settled on this. I prefer this over the ones that need batteries. Purchased last month. So she's been using it daily twice a day for the past two weeks. No complaints. I feel the timer feature is excellent because earlier she used to just swish the toothbrush in her mouth when pressed for time!
"
"
I love this tooth brush. Has amazing power and I allowed it to fully charge (which killed me, but do it) so it lasts and lasts.
"
"
very powerful very reliable my dentist was impressed
"
"
Long battery life, charges quickly, easy to use
"
"
I like this one, as it only has one speed, similar to my older model, it's the only toothbrush I've used in 15 yrs.
"
"
I like it just fine. Having just received it I have no idea about its battery life and it isn't traveling right now.
"
"
I have used an Oral B for some time.  This is to replace my old one.  It is as expected. Service from Amazon was great as usual.
"
"
This toothbrush is great. I can feel a difference and see a difference in my teeth after I brush every time.
"
"
Love my new toothbrush, but doesn't seem to be holding a charge like it says on packaging, but still a great clean
"
"
Still going strong after a year and a half, love this toothbrush.  Charge lasts for about 2 weeks with 2 people using it (different brush attachments of course).  My dental hygienist noticed a difference after I got it, hate using a regular tooth brush now when I'm away from home.
"
"
Nicely buit. No contacts exposed. I mean, it's my first elecric toothbrush and I wouldn't ever switch back.
"
"
Love it no complaintsSo far clean well
"
"
It has a built in timer to tell you when to move to another side of your mouth. The battery life is great and it is also super light.
"
"
The charge lasts about a week and it is excellent at remove plaque build up.
"
"
Oral B Pro power toothbrush provides the best cleaning experience for teeth.  Excellent product.
"
"
We replaced our old Braun Electric Toothbrush which had lasted at least twelve years.  We are more than happy with this newer updated version.
"
"
Battery lasts really long, and the charger is small, good for traveling.
"
"
During every use it would stall out, and I do not use excessive pressure. Returned for refund
"
"
I like it except the bristle it fizzled out very fast
"
"
Never tried the timer. Good size for travel. Works as expected
"
"
Works fine. I  wish it didn't have the timing feature built in, let me brush my teeth at my own pace!
"
"
As I stated previously, I cannot rate this product as I am giving it s a Christmas Gift.
"
"
i went from a 13 dollar electric form mouthwash to thisand its a world of differencea whole new world
"
"
Perfect brush. Love the pressure sensors, to show when the user is brushing too hard.
"
"
Do not buy this product. I bought it a month ago and it worked fine with battery lasting for a week everytime. And then immediately it stopped working with just dead battery. Does anyone know how to get refund?
"
"
Immediately upon getting this item, I found that it would not hold a charge. Despite what the instructions say on how long a full charge should last you, the product I received would flash red after every brushing cycle, regardless of how long I left it to charge for.
"
"
It does what it is supposed to, great quality at a reasonable price. Thanks
"
"
De très bonne qualité. Je le recommande !
"
"
This  toothbrush makes my teeth feel so much cleaner! I only have one criticism. You HAVE to take the brush head every time you use it, otherwise rust will form. Didn't do it for a few days and I already noticed some.
"
"
Great deal for this model.  Works great on my teeth. Great purchase
"
"
Very powerful. Cleans teeth very well. Also like the slim design
"
"
Does what its intended to do. We shall see what the dental hygenist says.
"
"
I like that is lets you know every 30 seconds when to change areas you are brushing.  It forces you to brush for 2 minutes
"
"
Works great.  Had a much older model, and this is faster and cleans better.  Love it!
"
"
Bought this on January 8 and It stopped working in the first week of March! Customer service gave me a big runaround. I have to pay for shipping to the repair center!
"
"
A voir a long terme mais sinon fait la job
"
"
My old Oral B stopped working (it was several years old).  This one I think is a bit more of a basic model to what I have but it does the job.  I am happy.  Not sure why one would get a higher end version.
"
"
Good solid tooth brush switched over to electric good brush to star off with.
"
"
All that you need in a powered toothbrush.  Has good power and the battery seems to me way better than my previous oral-b model.
"
"
Definitely seems like and excellent product so far. I love it and the fast shipping
"
"
All you need for perfectly clean teeth. I did not want all the extra features of the more expensive models such as Bluetooth. I would never use these features anyway.
"
"
i support all Oral B toothbrush, i got this just for traveling purpose only.
"
"
The toothbrush has worked well. My teeth feel very clean afterward. I like the 30 second timer function.
"
"
Oral b . Trusted company. Never fails
"
"
Fonctionne très bien pas de problème
"
"
Love this thing ! Couldn’t be happier
"
"
I'm very happy overall with the shipping and the toothbrush. Shipping was faster than expected. The brush works great. I've had no issues with the sensitivity sensor. It definitely works as promised.
"
"
Product was defective. Giving this a 5 star because I the manufacturer stood behind their product and I was well looked after. I am very happy with the replacement. Delivery from Amazon was faster than expected.
"
"
Works very well,  not sure of the benefits of buying a more expansive model.
"
"
we ordered on prime day , so ok value. works good
"
"
I really like this toothbrush. I've never owned an electric before and it leaves my mouth feeling really fresh. The 2 minute timer is handy too.
"
"
I find the pulse rather rough. My last OralB was much smoother. Although I can't be bothered to return it I can't really recommend it either.
"
"
Works great, I’ve always used Philips products and I find they both do a great job.
"
"
This toothbrush is great and love using it!
"
"
The timer is amazing!  It vibrates when it’s time to move to a different section of your mouth.  Highly recommend!
"
"
I have since a few mounth and i'am very satisfied.
"
"
C est ma 3 e brosse à dents Oral-B et suis toujours aussi satisfait
"
"
Excellent produit. Je recommande.
"
"
Good Price, fast shipping and good quality, Thank you.
"
"
I've been using it for a month now and I'm really pleased with the purchase. It feels very solid and it has a great grip. The timer is very nice.
"
"
Je suis satisfait  de date de  achat
"
"
Easy to use. Love the timer. Teeth feel much cleaner. Dental hygienist is impressed with oral health improvement.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien et aide vraiment à réduire l'accumulation de tartre.
"
"
Been using this brand for over 20 years.
"
"
Teeth feel cleaner then with a regular tooth brush.  Timer function is good but doesn't alot time for brushing your tounge. Not a big negative tho
"
"
Tres bien et utile par contre la batterie n'a pas une grosse autonomie. Je l'utilise une a deux fois par jour et elle ne dure que deux jours.
"
"
It's quite better than the Oral-B Vitality, no issue with it so far.
"
"
I especially like the timer which helps to keep track of the length of my brushing .it does a very good job of keeping my mouth clean. I bought this model for travelling and am glad I did.
"
"
It is 'blah' in appearance and too thin and therefore awkward to hold. Worst of all, although a traveling case is available for it, you can't actually travel to most places with it because it's only made for 110V.
"
"
Great Value, works perfectly.....sturdy and fits perfectly in a small place
"
"
Good price good product tickles at first lol the 30 second timer helps
"
"
I have not brought it on my travels but I love the way it cleans and the timer to change to a different are of your mouth.
"
"
Rempli très bien sa fonction. Très satisfaites
"
"
Got these for the whole family. Heads last a long time and so does the battery life. Sleek design.
"
"
The toothbrush is excellent and works well
"
"
works great and for the price a very good buy
"
"
Good quality product, a bit expensive
"
"
This is a great toothbrush for its price. I am really happy with it and the replacement heads are not too costly. I am going to get a few more for other family members.
"
"
Love it, couldn't live without it! Teeth are so clean!
"
"
Every day toothpaste drips down toothbrush.  Sounds like it’s about to die.  Just not happy with it!
"
"
Its a great product at a good price

A great investment for your health. This toothbrush is like the really fancy ones but much more bare bone. You don't need all those extra features. This toothbrush is perfect! Once you use this, it becomes difficult to go back to the normal toothbrush
"
"
Satisfied with this toothbrush, the 2 minutes timer could be very useful for people who brush their teeth way too fast.
"
"
Great toothbrush! Takes a little getting used to the power of it, but works great! Replacement heads are a little expensive, mind you.
"
"
Will see performance over time ty
"
"
I thought this would have a built in timer, but it didn't. Maybe I didn't read the product description carefully. Otherwise, no complaints.
"
"
Works well, cleans teeth so well you feel like you just came from the dentist!
"
"
Works great though if you have really sensitive teeth, I recommend you upgrade to the brush that has a lower speed.
"
"
This does not hold the charge nearly as long as the older model I had purchased 10 years ago.I really do not like this one and feel I paid a way too much money for an inferior toothbrush.
"
"
no others used/purchased in past to compare to, but seems pretty good
"
"
My wife was a dental hygienist in her working life, and she loves it. Personally, I notice the ""more thorough"" clean.
"
"
That brush makes teeth white
"
"
My girlfriend just loves it
"
"
Great product for a good price
"
"
Got this brush because my hygienist highly recommended getting an electric, but I feel like my mouth feels cleaner after using a manual. The brush seems fine just doesn’t do the job as well as I was expecting
"
"
Brushes teeth very well.  Not recommended as a back scrubber.
"
"
The battery of my toothbrush is dead, recharging does not help. Since it is not sold by Amazon, I could not get a replacement. Got it on Black Friday with 40% off.
"
"
Best product I bought till date
"
"
received two of these at the black Friday price, don't think I can go wrong !
"
"
longévité de la batterie décevante
"
"
Great, affordable electric toothbrush. Works well.
"
"
I've had an Oral B 1000 for about 5 years, just bought a second for the wife. Battery lasts longer than previous gen which is nice. Overall Great.
"
"
This replaces one I lost at hotel.
"
"
I really like it.  It cleans my teeth well and is easier on the gum line.
"
"
Works well on full charge , decent electric toothbrush but  best to keep it on the charger to always have maximum power !Still kind of loud though
"
"
Great brush great price I bought 3, 2 as gifts. Easy to use easy to charge love it.
"
"
I am so glad I bought this toothbrush. It does a great job and I love the buzz reminder at 30 secs and a longer one at 2 mins. My teeth feel and look much better.
"
"
Oral b que dire de plus...
"
"
Got this just today and there was a noticeable difference after brushing. Highly recommends this.
"
"
Plug would not go in my socket.  Had to use a extension plug
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It stays charged for days, at least 5 as I have yet to run it down. The charger is small and perfect for travel, and I got the replacement heads for a great price through Amazon as well.
"
"
Dentist recommended I get an electric toothbrush.  This one didn't break the bank and my dentist noticed that I had switched.
"
"
Good tooth brush. I miss the indicator telling me that two minutes are over - now 30 second intervals.
"
"
Good quality as always
"
"
faut voir pour la longévité du produit,..Mais après 3 mois ça fonctionne encore.
"
"
Utilisé depuis deux semaines, il me semble que mes dents sont plus blanches et je sens mes dents propres comme après un nettoyage chez le dentiste!!! Je recommande fortement😁
"
"
Works well and stays charged a long time. Only one speed though, which is fine for me.
"
"
Exactly what I wanted.
"
"
Great charge, functional
"
"
Had electric toothbrushes before and have loved them.  This one feels too rough for my liking.  I was hoping for more if a ultrasonic experience like the Panasonic toothbrush.  Does the job tmthougb and was a decent price.
"
"
Timer function is a great feature
"
"
Nettoie bien, efficace
"
"
much better than competitor
"
"
Amazing does a much better job of cleaning than any other brush I've used
"
"
Love this product.  Great function at a reasonable price.  I can notice a difference from the standard hand held toothbrush.  highly recommended.
"
"
I have had a regular (i.e. cheap) electric Oral-B for a few years, and I was pretty happy with it. During my last dental checkup, my dentist mentioned that I should think on using a professional power toothbrush. You see, the pH in my mouth is quite alkaline (he said), which protects me from cavities but facilitates plaque formation. Power brushes are excellent for plaque removal. I said to him I'll think about it.I was not sure if investing in a more expensive brush would be worth it, but luckily my local big box store has a display of the available Oral-B power brushes, from the simplest to the most fancy. This allowed me to actually feel the HUGE difference in power between a regular electric brush, and the ones in the professional line. The higher up you go in this line, the more expensive they get. Power wise, there is no difference between the humble 1000 and the super fancy 5000. Of course, with the latter you get a LCD telling you the brushing time, the pressure against the teeth, etc. All things I can live without, and still getting a true office clean feeling after every brushing.So far the brushing experience has been great. You need to remember to be gentle on the pressure while brushing, otherwise it could be bad for your gums.I'll update the post with longer use and experience. This is a highly recommended toothbrush.UPDATE January 2015 - Well, I am happy to report that the brush is truly a good investment in oral health. My last 3 dental checkups have shown a decrease in the amount of plaque, which it never happened before while I was using the regular electric brush.The actual brush is as good as new. I haven't noticed any issues with the rechargeable battery or with the brushing power. I change the head every 2 to 3 months, depending on its condition, and not really following the colour change indicating bristles.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Head fits other Oral-B toothbrushes. I was replacing one that didn't hold a charge anymore.  The other one lasted for about 5 years so I know it's a good product.
"
"
Very good quality. My hygienist was impressed with my brushing after 2 weeks of using this brush! It's noisier than my previous one but also more efficient, so I'm ok with the noise if it means better brushing.
"
"
It’s s good electric toothbrush. I’ve had the same one before my stopped working for a least 4yrs
"
"
Sweet device, great price and arrived next day. Only have to charge it once a week (I use it twice daily). Mouth feels so clean vs using a standard brush.
"
"
Good Tooth brush at a fair price. Been using it for over a year now and still works flawless.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
Solid toothbrush
"
"
Love my brush! Black does show a the toothpaste though so needs to be rinsed extra well
"
"
Très très bien👍
"
"
unit works quite noisy  used it twice ...stay tuned
"
"
Best money I ever invested on my teeth! Works great and charges easily. It's awesome that everything you need is inside the box, just unwrap and brush!
"
"
I bought this to my boyfriend and it only works for half year.  Now it can't be turn on even it's fully charged
"
"
Very good product. Charges fast, comes with a charger you just set the tooth brush on. Super convenient.
"
"
Works great so far
"
"
Very nice brush. Notice a difference in how my teeth feel already in a few days use.
"
"
Really good got the price
"
"
it works and came the same day
"
"
Had my first one for a long time, probably a decade. Replaced it with another that works great!
"
"
This was a replacement , very happy with it.
"
"
I think it does a great job of cleaning
"
"
Gentle, yet thorough cleaning. Can’t ask for more than tat.
"
"
It's ok, does the job however it's very loud and uncomfortable
"
"
Perfect! High-quality brush. Battery last for a week. Using it for a year and still works like a charm!
"
"
Works well. Good charge.
"
"
These brushes are an excellent purchase...Thank you Amazon for such a selection...
"
"
For $50 a great. We toothbrush
"
"
It's a little bit louder than my previous electric toothbrush, but it's not something I'm too worried about. Looking at how fast it moves made me think it was slow, but once actually using it on my teeth, I realized it moves faster than my previous one. This is a great brush!
"
"
I am extremely happy with my purchase. I like the pulse timer, and the ease of the device.  I would highly recommend this device to anyone interested in an electric toothbrush.
"
"
The best toothbrush I ever tried.Realy does what is supposed to do.Great to clean between teeth.Amazing product.
"
"
The battery life is great.
"
"
Great toothbrush!
"
"
Great toothbrush.
"
"
Good quality, very satisfied and long battery.
"
"
Good price and good quality
"
"
Love my Oral-B Pro 1000, cleans my mouth and teeth effortlessly. Would recommend for starters using electric toothbrush due to power not being so strong for those with sensitive gums.
"
"
la livraison s'est faite tel que prévue et l'article était comme décrit .
"
"
I like that it does a very good job of cleaning my teeth.  They feel just as clean as the cleaning done by the dentist""s office
"
"
The battery will last you 5 days on a road trip tops. It was a great clean but the brush bristles got weaker after only 5 cleanings making it feel less powerful.
"
"
Not sure if it's just me but I couldn't handle the roughness on teeth and gum. It felt like the brush was trying to know my teeth out :)
"
"
Too noisy and rattley, I sent it back. I like my sonic brush better.
"
"
Works grate looks grate
"
"
Battery won’t hold charge for long, timer never worked , not made for travel -
"
"
Product is as advertisedWould recommend to family and friends
"
"
minuterie intégré pour nous indiquer quand changer de coté
"
"
Je n'avais jamais eu une brosse à dents électrique...c’est fou la différence...n'hésiter pas à vous procurer ce modèle en particulier...je vois pas ce qu'un modèle plus cher fait de plus car celui-ci satisfait amplement pour un brossage de dent...même que le monde trouve que j'ai l'air moins bête!:)
"
"
excellent produit
"
"
Great item for the price, only downside is that it's a little loud
"
"
I'm embarrassed to say that I brush more regularly now with this product. It just so easy now!
"
"
Aaaaaa+++++
"
"
Love it.
"
"
bonne qualité
"
"
Bon rapport qualité prix.
"
"
Perfect
"
"
I haven't traveled with it so therefore cannot comment. I do not like the timer function.
"
"
So far so good. Works like my previous one that I busted when I tried charging overseas.
"
"
Exactly what I am looking for
"
"
It has reasonable price. But only one speed  Good design and quality.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush, would recommend it. Shipping was fast as always with Amazon.
"
"
Absolutely love this tooth brush! Leaves my teeth clean and the toothbrush head is small enough to get into all the difficult areas in the back of my mouth.
"
"
This product was recommended to me by my oral specialist to help keep plaque down.  It has been doing a good job.
"
"
It’s very reliable, easy to use, and way less messy than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
great way to deep clean your teeth my mouth is very happy, thanks
"
"
It stopped working withing 2 weeks of use.
"
"
recommended
"
"
I feel like I get a really good clean with this brush! I also really like that it vibrates as a sign of timing how long you're brushing for.
"
"
It's a toothbrush, it brushes teeth, what else is there to say. It brushes teeth better than a non-electric toothbrush.
"
"
Like how clean my teeth are.. good teach in between the teethThe vibration is heavy, tho tolerable
"
"
Used item less then 1 month and doesn't charge on it's stand any longer.
"
"
Fonctionne bien , batterie durable si vous l'utiliser comme conseillé .
"
"
love this! Got it on sale for a great price. My teeth feel super clean after each use.
"
"
I have been use for a week and is excellent
"
"
Soins dentaires
"
"
Great
"
"
Mine didn’t come with part (g) .. (the brushes holder than connects to the charger) I’m not sure if it’s supposed to come with it? But I don’t have it..
"
"
Replacing a 10 yr old one, works great, I forgot how much power it had at the beginning.
"
"
Lasts maybe about a week which is expected. Worked well with no issues
"
"
Great cleaning . Purchased this product again and again and will continue to do do so !
"
"
Best electric toothbrush- leaves teeth feeling smooth and shiny
"
"
Works well. Holds a charge for quite some time (I put it back on the charger once a week).  My teeth feel really clean when I am done using it.
"
"
Battery life is great. Replacing my previousone that has lasted for years.  For travelling it should come with some type of case or bag to keep it clean.
"
"
Really like this toothbrush! There is no travel case or anything to protect the brush head that comes with it. However, the brush is powerful and makes my mouth feel so clean.
"
"
Great!
"
"
Très satisfaite !
"
"
Great product! Very pleased. Will go on-line to see whether I can purchase a travelling kit.
"
"
This was recommended by my dental hygienist -- and its everything she said it would be!
"
"
Works great
"
"
As expected
"
"
Mon chum l'adore sa nettoie en cliss qui dit
"
"
Perso
"
"
For the first time in my life the dental hygienist told me i'm doing good job with cleaning my teeth, lol
"
"
Would Buy Again
"
"
Charge lasts long good quality arrived fast
"
"
Low scores only because I do not use these functions. Product meets all expectations.
"
"
very usefull
"
"
Goodbye old toothbrush. These electric brushes are the way to go, very happy I ordered this.
"
"
Arrived early. The Oral B 1000 is much thinner than the 300. Easier to hold and maneuver.
"
"
I purchased this powered toothbrush as a replacement for an earlier model (from the same manufacturer) that had worked for me for at least a decade. The new one arrived promptly, appropriately packaged, and worked first time with no problems. It has only one ""speed"" (unlike its predecessor, which had two speeds), but the speed is perfectly fine. Definitely recommended.
"
"
I love it and I will definitely buy it again
"
"
I charged the toothbrush all day, the yellow battery icon is flashing and yet, when I press the start button, nothing happens.
"
"
Powerful, I feel very clean after using it.The instructions are great as well, there is a guideline on how you should use this to brush.The Battery lasts for a week which is excellentI brush twice a day.Hopefully it will last a couple of years
"
"
Very nice product. Great brushing. Good value
"
"
for most 2 years, still working in perfert condition. Just need to change brush head, easy to clean tooths.
"
"
works great shipping quick
"
"
Très satisfaite!
"
"
It cleans my teeth really well compared to my old sonicare toothbrush. Nice and effective.
"
"
BEST ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH FOR THE PRICE.
"
"
Wow, this is much more powerful than my old one.  Very nice upgrade.
"
"
Have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for years. Love how it makes my teeth feel after brushing.
"
"
I bought this because I wanted to upgrade from the Vitality pro I've been using for a few years. I read so many reviews and decided to give this one a try. I love it! My teeth feel super clean after every use. Very happy with it!
"
"
Compact and fits the use for travel well with the case acquired.  The timer function built in is also very beneficial
"
"
I can t compare because never had electric toothbrush before but this definitely worth the investment
"
"
Works okay but has only 1speed.
"
"
Not as powerful or great as my old Soniccare, however, the price was right.
"
"
Bonne brosse a dents
"
"
Le brossage est très efficace mais l’efficacité diminue au bout de 3 jours..  la brosse à dent doit être rechargée plus souvent.  Je suis quand même très satisfaite.
"
"
J'aime bien la minuterie
"
"
Not true: ""Senses when you brush too hard with pressure sensor""I find this tooth brush's motor to be too aggressive.
"
"
Livraison rapide. Brosse à dents très efficace et sans gadget inutile.La tête  est agréable et facile à changer. Je recommande sans hésitation.
"
"
Produit offert en cadeau d'échange pour Noël.  Selon la dite personne, elle adore sa nouvelle brosse à dents.  Très bon produit et surtout très efficace.
"
"
Everything,  everything went smoothly from time of purchase till the product reached my residence undamaged.  Product is amazing best investment I've made to date on my Teeth. Thank you 😁
"
"
Étuit de voyage serait apprécié
"
"
Used for one month and now will not work.
"
"
Not a very powerful toothbrush.  Needs charging frequently as it works better with a full charge.
"
"
AAAAA++++
"
"
Battery could be better. Recharge everyweek
"
"
Very good but not sure where to buy the extra brushes.. bought some today but I don’t think they are compatible
"
"
What can I say, Oral B doesn't disappoint.
"
"
as advertised, great toothbrush
"
"
Seems as good as the much more expensive one I had before, same brand too.
"
"
3rd Oral b, I love the clean feel and the pulse timer
"
"
I purchased a noisy one. Because I need to brush, it wasn’t worth the bother to return. First one like this. Strange.
"
"
Brushes are too rough on my sensitive gums. Do not reccomend this at all.
"
"
no 1
"
"
Purchased for my partner and he is crazy about this toothbrush. He is very pleased with the whole mouth clean.
"
"
A gift for someone and this was the condition it came in.
"
"
Love it!  Very light, gentle and my teeth have never been so clean!
"
"
I love it. Like coming out of the dentist
"
"
Works as described.
"
"
Great quality, great price (on sale) and the charger makes it very convenient.
"
"
Good for the price
"
"
Absolutely love this
"
"
Très bon.
"
"
I like it works Really good
"
"
One of the best electric toothbrushes I have ever owned. Very satisfied.
"
"
Works really well and is very effective. The teeth feel like they have been polished.
"
"
Love this. You don’t need to spend a lot of $ for a quality toothbrush
"
"
Excellent
"
"
Although we already had an oral b electric tooth brush we find this to be much more superior
"
"
It's good, but the rubber where the on button is is starting to peel off after only 6 months.
"
"
It works well
"
"
Love it! Teeth so clean
"
"
Arrived sooooooo late but other than that pretty good
"
"
Loveee
"
"
Awesome toothbrush cleans well!
"
"
This is a really good product. the 30 second timer really makes this a mindless activity, and the brush leaves my teeth feeling after dentist clean.
"
"
Powerful toothbrush. Leaves your teeth feeling very clean and smooth. The battery lasts long as well
"
"
Great
"
"
Was replacing my 10 yr old one that died, same great brushing, no complaints and got shipped fast.
"
"
First electric toothbrush I've ever owned. Had no troubles, issues or problems. Does exactly what it's supposed to.
"
"
Excellent produit à bon prix, livraion rapide.
"
"
Good
"
"
The round brush head of course
"
"
I have used a battery operated tooth brush for years but the rechargeable Electric Toothbrush does an incredibly great job....very happy I made this transition.
"
"
Cleans my teeth well.
"
"
Je suis decu car la tete pivote pas
"
"
Love it, works great and charge holds for the time needed. It vibrates every 30s and then a longer vibrate after 2min so you know when you can stop brushing.
"
"
Le brossage de dents du soir.J’aurais aimé un avertissement que la batterie achève au lieu qu’elle arrête subitement!
"
"
After searching  stores here , price was very much the same
"
"
The product was delivered very quickly and is as described. Works very well, I'm am very happy with it.
"
"
I use it for almost about one month, everything is well, not find any problem. I have not make it clear that the how to use the discount card wich is bing at the same product mailbox, and why not have a chinese language booklet?
"
"
This is the third Oral-B 1000 Electric toothbrush I have had and I am always pleased with the product. Lasts forever and cleans effectively.
"
"
Perfect! And way better price than in store I found for the same thing.
"
"
Great and powerful brush, charge last for over 10 uses
"
"
So far so good
"
"
this is an amazing product!  it cleans well and battery life lasts a long time (1-2 weeks) even when brushing 2/3 times per day
"
"
Ideal a+
"
"
Cleans your teeth like 700% better than using anything else. One full charge lasts 5-6 days with 2x/day usage.
"
"
Amazing! Thank you amazon for having this on sale. Works great and gets the teeth cleaning done right. I just don’t like how loud it can be hahah
"
"
Did not comment on battery life since I have only used for a few weeks.  Need a carrying case for travelling.
"
"
Teeth feel so clean and so much whiter.
"
"
Firm toothbrushing.  I love the way it feels.
"
"
Bought this for my son who was skeptical it would be any different than any other toothbrush.  He messaged me the other day to tell me it was “dentist quality”.
"
"
Great value,Perfect for kids
"
"
The battery life died after a while of use and I am no longer able to return it. It is now not useable as the battery doesn’t even last 30 seconds.
"
"
Does what it is supposed to do.
"
"
Best toothbrush investment ever... My mouth feels like I just left the dentist office....
"
"
Super je l'adore et ca nettoie tellement mieux qu'une brosse normal !!!
"
"
Quotidienne. La charge ne tient pas plus que 5 jours....
"
"
We ordered one for myself and my wife and we noticed a difference right away! Good product
"
"
I think I like it after several weeks use.  Not sure of battery duration. after 5 days it is running but not as powerful.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Great product! It is simple and effective. Great value for money.
"
"
Significantly different and better than regular toothbrushes
"
"
Works great. Holds the charge for days
"
"
je viens de la recevoir je ne peux pas l'évaluer...les questions ne conviennent pas au produit. Lorsque ont viens de le recevoir...
"
"
Works as expected
"
"
This doesn’t come with the pressure sensor as listed in the description. Don’t purchase this item if that is what you are looking for
"
"
Love it.
"
"
Works for a while but doesn't hold a charge after a few months and hope it's totally useless. Not happy at all!
"
"
It works well
"
"
Works as expected
"
"
Absolutely wonderful, nothing wrong with it. Can go many days without a charge. Would recommend to anyone.
"
"
Bought this for my son, and he is really liking it.  Was pretty powerful and took some getting used too, but it is well worth it.
"
"
Product is as described.
"
"
Bought these for my husband and I. We love them so much! Teeth feel very clean, charging is very simple. Heads are not to expensive!
"
"
Je la recommande excellent
"
"
Works great, but surprisingly loud. Like that it indicates when to switch quadrants. Holds a charge for a long time too!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Everything about my toothbrush is excellent.  I love it.
"
"
My dental hygienist recommended as others to strong for 90 yr. Old women
"
"
5 stars ⭐️
"
"
Great
"
"
great product
"
"
Best tooth brush I've ever owned! Feels like it's polishing up your teeth, battery lasts for about 10 rounds before needing a charge.
"
"
I was initially really pleased with this product...until the battery completely died (even charged for 20+hrs as recommended) not even 2 months after getting it...
"
"
use is for cleaning teeth
"
"
Great got It last Black Friday and still kicking
"
"
As a tooth brush a 5 in all......cleaning my boots.... not so great a 2
"
"
after you try a electric toothbrush like this one, you'll never gone a use a regular toothbrush. good product!
"
"
Bon appareil qui fait du brossage de dents une mois grosse corvée.
"
"
Works not too bad but battery is awful-and this is new??-can not hold for 3 brushes-very disappointed
"
"
Noisier than my previous electric toothbrush, but much better at getting to back teeth and the backs of front teeth.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush so I don't have anything to compare it to, but it does an amazing job. Couldn't be happier with the item.
"
"
Nothing to complain about really. Overall a good product
"
"
Exactly as advertised.
"
"
Love this tooth brush, since switching to electric my teeth have never been so clean
"
"
Really love this brush. My teeth feel sooooo much cleaner than using a manual brush. Very pleased.
"
"
C'est un cadeau et la personne renouvelait le même produit, donc satisfaite.
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dents, or je me questionne sur la durée de vis de la batterie.(suivi les recommandations du fournisseur)
"
"
Good if you want a step up from your regular electronic toothbrushes
"
"
After use I feel like I just came from the Dentist after a cleaning.
"
"
wonderful
"
"
Excellent product. I recommend it 100%.
"
"
I received the product that was described.
"
"
belle brosse à dents, fonctionne bien.
"
"
good quality. but it needs charged very often. Overall it's a good deal
"
"
Works very well, I really like the intermittent time of 30 seconds.
"
"
wife loves it, really powerful
"
"
Un achat genial.
"
"
The battery quality is so bad, only can last for 3 days
"
"
good length and power
"
"
Went from a manual brush to this electric and my teeth have not been cleaner, delivers on ad that it cleans teeth by gum line well
"
"
Bought the black and the white version. Great products
"
"
Would like to see a larger brushes for these. Takes longer to cover the area.
"
"
Such a great toothbrush. I’m so happy I made this purchase!
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
Feel so clean after a 2 min brush
"
"
The timer function where it vibrates every 30seconds is good for the kids
"
"
Timely delivery and works great.
"
"
Thanks my teeth are white now
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Works perfectly!
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
for the price I paid it is still going strong 2 years later
"
"
Not nice to use
"
"
Great product, only gripe is the advertised sensor which detects when brushing too roughly doesn't actually seem to work.
"
"
This is a purchase for my son, Good
"
"
Thanks
"
"
Fonctionne très bien cette brosse répond très bien à ce que je voulais.
"
"
'nough said. good toothbrush.
"
"
Good toothbrush i just don't like that it stop working for about 2 seg everytime i use it.
"
"
Perfect.
"
"
Does it job very well
"
"
Je l'utilise depuis 2 mois, et je suis très satisfait du produit jusqu'à présent.Même que je pourrai dire que plus jamais je vais retourner aux brosses à dents manuel.
"
"
Can't go wrong with oral B
"
"
i love the small charger it came with, does take up a lot of space. decent battery life too!I would recommend

Lives up to all my expectations. Never had a toothbrush that works so well and makes my mouth feel wonderful
"
"
best of third one I have bought. I recommend this item
"
"
Brushes teeth, yep. Works 100% as intended, motor doesn't seem weak. Charging is pain free.
"
"
For brushing my teeth.  I haven't had it very long so your rate features are not conclusive as yet.
"
"
I have used oral-B electric tooth brush for years and truly believe it has helped me keep my teeth healthy.
"
"
It feels like it’s dounf most of the work for me. Looking into the Genius 8000
"
"
Comparing to other tooth brushes that we had this one is very weak.

Toothbrush works well. Has a “timer” that lets me know when it’s been two minutes! Teeth feel clean afterwards.

Wish there was a case with it but overall good quality 👍
"

Everyday use for tooth brush.
"
"
Good size, long lasting battery, works well
"
"
The best electric toothbrush on the market.  This one is the very basic one compared to the other models .
"
"
It works well but there is no sound or timer as promised.
"
"
Due to some reason it’s not charging. After 2 min use it is not working
"
"
I have been using it for a month and it has been a good investment.I really like how small the recharging stand is.
"
"
Great product. Pleasure to use. My only complaint is the cost of the replacement brishes
"
"
J adore
"
"
I had the higher model for the last ten years. It showed the amount of time I brushed for, and it was heavier and more substantive, but I find this just as good.
"
"
It's exactly as advertised. I'm very happy with it.
"
"
Great product! Fast shipping! No problems!
"
"
For the price I love this toothbrush.  I'm very happy with my purchase.

Received my oral-b toothbrush quite quickly but found after using it took a week for my gums to get used to the powerful brushing, my gums were a little tender but is now fine and my teeth looks brighter.

 I've been using this toothbrush for a couple weeks now, and I really like it. My mouth and teeth feel very clean after each use.I'm prone to having mouth ulcers rather frequently, and I haven't had any since I've been using this brush; maybe that's just a coincidence, but perhaps it's helping keep my mouth cleaner.Note that this is a vibrating brush, not a rotating one.One thing I really like about this brush is it's matte black finish. Toothpaste residues don't stay on it; it stays clean all the time. Before this brush, I've been using an Oral-B electric brush; it looked completely disgusting after a while, because it accumulates dried toothpaste very easily. That's not the case for this brush.I still did not have to charge the battery yet, so battery life is really good. Also, its operation is relatively quiet.The only things I would improve is maybe include an inter-dental head in the package. Also, there is a small gap between the head and the body which could be removed... But I'm just being nitpicky here.
"
"
Honestly never thought I would buy a sonic tooth brush in my life but I love this one, as long as you make sure to still make brushing motions with like you normally would it gets your teeth nice and clean. The 3 settings are very nice, massage is the best. The settings are easy to change and the battery life is amazing. I have not had to charge it yet. I love the holder as it keeps the tooth brush clean and allows me to carry and extra head. The brush head is smaller than normal tooth brushes but because I have a small mouth and wisdom teeth it makes it perfect for me to still reach them and get them clean. The tooth brush is fully waterproof which makes brushing your teeth in the shower and cleaning the brush much easier. It's not very loud which I like, way more quiet than the battery powered ones and more quiet than my boyfriends Phillip's sonic care.
"
"
All my life I've been using electronic toothbrush so now that my Oral-B is broken I need to find the replacement but wanted to try a different brand and see. I found this while searching on Amazon and decided to buy give it a try. I was very impressed when I see the box, it seems like it made for VIP with a stylish big black box and inside everything's also in black boxes. It comes with an electric brush, 4 brush heads, charging cable and a travel box. The brush is very comfortable to hold and operate. It has 3 different brush modes which I absolutely love it since I have sensitive gum. I prefer the gentle massage but could use a strong brush when needed. This is also waterproof so in case if it drops in the water while cleaning your teeth it should be fine. Finally I have to admit that this battery last a very long time because my old Oral-B only last maybe 2 days top. By the way the travel case is a fantastic idea to throw in because this thing can travel with me anywhere. Amazon take out the option to upload picture and video so I can't post anything up. Please give me a helpful vote if you find this review useful.

"

 The packaging and the product itself is well made - great presentation overall. This is my first electric toothbrush. So far it lives up to its claims. This is a vibrating toothbrush and not a rotating one. It is powerful and maybe a little bit too powerful for its purpose. For $50 this is a well-thought product that could last you a year or until the brush head supply lasts. Below is what I got straight out of the package:1 Black Brush Handle4 Brush Heads1 USB Charging Cable1 Travel CaseThis is really meant for travelers. The travel case is useless for home use - the brush heads and charger go in it.
"
"
I have always been wanting to purchase a sonic toothbrush but always stopping myself from buying it because of not only that it is not cheap but also I don't think it is worth to buy. But this one is definitely worth it, it's affordable, comes in a very sleek and classy design, and also I did not imagine it works better with minimal efforts, than my regular manual toothbrush. And what I loved most about it is, it comes with a travel case, waterproof, and comes in 4 replacement brushes. I will definitely recommend this product to my family!!!!
"
"
I did not expect much of this toothbrush since it is a lesser known brand. While I am used to using electric toothbrushes, this is a really great surprise.Packaging:I honestly thought there was a jewelry inside the box when I got it. It is well packed, the magnetic hard box makes it really premium by not even opening it yet. No other toothbrush manufacturer comes close on how well this product is packaged.Build and Feel:It is made of hard plastic with no soft rubber grip, which is perfect because those rubber grips can be can home for bacteria ang molds. It is a little too long compared to other brands. It doesn't bother me anyways. The power button feels durable and has a good response. The only gripe I have is that the vibration on the handle is pretty strong because of the powerful motor. If they added a rubber damper around the motor, it would make it more comfortable to use.Bristle:They are soft and the size is just right. Make sure you brush lightly to achieve optimal cleaning. The backside is hard plastic which is ok. Having a soft rubber-like texture would make this perfect!Performance:This is where this outperforms the competition. Like I said, I have used other electric toothbrushes before but this one but I noticed after my first brush, my teeth are noticeably cleaner. The ""Massage"" feature is a nice bonus because you can dav your gums with it without getting hurt.Overall, I am impressed with this. I thought I am throwing away money by trying a lesser know brand but I guess I was wrong. I have yet to know if the 30-day battery life they claim is true. With 1-year warranty, I sure hope this lasts longer longafter the warranty is done.Update: I haven't charged it yet since I got it! Battery life is definitely going strong!

 This toothbrush's noise level is very low and subtle, which is a plus since I go to bed later than my roommate and her bedroom's door is right next to the bathroom's door.I have to say, as someone who suffers from chronic generalized pain, that the aspect I like the most is how comfortable it is to hold and handle. It's not heavy and the size is perfect. The texture makes it easy to grip and handle without dropping it. Most importantly, it's much easier for me to keep a good oral hygiene as it doesn't make my wrists sore!The toothbrush also arrived in a good-looking package and included a travel case which allows you to carry the part that has the motor in it, along with 2 toothbrush tips.It also came with a charging cable and 2 different tips : a micro USB and a USB-C. I can't however comment on the battery lifetime since I've only used it twice so far, but it however arrived already charged so I was able to use it right after unpacking it.I'm overall satisfied and would recommend this Fairywill toothbrush without hesitation!
"
"
The toothbrush has very powerful vibrations! The box it came in was very nice with separated compartments for everything. Multiple heads is a great feature and allows my partner and I to share the toothbrush. The handle is a great design and it keeps the moisture from getting inside the brush. Excellent tooth brush.
"
"
I bought one many months ago, and it didn’t work that well, so I decided to get a new one. This one was perfect! It looks much nicer than the one I had before, and it worked perfectly as well. The vibration of this toothbrush is consistent and very high quality. It’s also rechargeable, no more batteries which is much better than the one I had. Charging it for an hour will last you more than 3 weeks! It also came with three replacement toothbrushes which is really nice. The travel case provided was cool looking and robust. Overall, great purchase! Will consider getting more for my family!

 The packaging and the product itself is well made - great presentation overall. This is my first electric toothbrush. So far it lives up to its claims. This is a vibrating toothbrush and not a rotating one. It is powerful and maybe a little bit too powerful for its purpose. For $50 this is a well-thought product that could last you a year or until the brush head supply lasts. Below is what I got straight out of the package:1 Black Brush Handle4 Brush Heads1 USB Charging Cable1 Travel CaseThis is really meant for travelers. The travel case is useless for home use - the brush heads and charger go in it.

I have always been wanting to purchase a sonic toothbrush but always stopping myself from buying it because of not only that it is not cheap but also I don't think it is worth to buy. But this one is definitely worth it, it's affordable, comes in a very sleek and classy design, and also I did not imagine it works better with minimal efforts, than my regular manual toothbrush. And what I loved most about it is, it comes with a travel case, waterproof, and comes in 4 replacement brushes. I will definitely recommend this product to my family!!!!

I did not expect much of this toothbrush since it is a lesser known brand. While I am used to using electric toothbrushes, this is a really great surprise.Packaging:I honestly thought there was a jewelry inside the box when I got it. It is well packed, the magnetic hard box makes it really premium by not even opening it yet. No other toothbrush manufacturer comes close on how well this product is packaged.Build and Feel:It is made of hard plastic with no soft rubber grip, which is perfect because those rubber grips can be can home for bacteria ang molds. It is a little too long compared to other brands. It doesn't bother me anyways. The power button feels durable and has a good response. The only gripe I have is that the vibration on the handle is pretty strong because of the powerful motor. If they added a rubber damper around the motor, it would make it more comfortable to use.Bristle:They are soft and the size is just right. Make sure you brush lightly to achieve optimal cleaning. The backside is hard plastic which is ok. Having a soft rubber-like texture would make this perfect!Performance:This is where this outperforms the competition. Like I said, I have used other electric toothbrushes before but this one but I noticed after my first brush, my teeth are noticeably cleaner. The ""Massage"" feature is a nice bonus because you can dav your gums with it without getting hurt.Overall, I am impressed with this. I thought I am throwing away money by trying a lesser know brand but I guess I was wrong. I have yet to know if the 30-day battery life they claim is true. With 1-year warranty, I sure hope this lasts longer longafter the warranty is done.Update: I haven't charged it yet since I got it! Battery life is definitely going strong!

 This toothbrush's noise level is very low and subtle, which is a plus since I go to bed later than my roommate and her bedroom's door is right next to the bathroom's door.I have to say, as someone who suffers from chronic generalized pain, that the aspect I like the most is how comfortable it is to hold and handle. It's not heavy and the size is perfect. The texture makes it easy to grip and handle without dropping it. Most importantly, it's much easier for me to keep a good oral hygiene as it doesn't make my wrists sore!The toothbrush also arrived in a good-looking package and included a travel case which allows you to carry the part that has the motor in it, along with 2 toothbrush tips.It also came with a charging cable and 2 different tips : a micro USB and a USB-C. I can't however comment on the battery lifetime since I've only used it twice so far, but it however arrived already charged so I was able to use it right after unpacking it.I'm overall satisfied and would recommend this Fairywill toothbrush without hesitation!

The toothbrush has very powerful vibrations! The box it came in was very nice with separated compartments for everything. Multiple heads is a great feature and allows my partner and I to share the toothbrush. The handle is a great design and it keeps the moisture from getting inside the brush. Excellent tooth brush.

I bought one many months ago, and it didn’t work that well, so I decided to get a new one. This one was perfect! It looks much nicer than the one I had before, and it worked perfectly as well. The vibration of this toothbrush is consistent and very high quality. It’s also rechargeable, no more batteries which is much better than the one I had. Charging it for an hour will last you more than 3 weeks! It also came with three replacement toothbrushes which is really nice. The travel case provided was cool looking and robust. Overall, great purchase! Will consider getting more for my family!

Very elegant packaging ! Comes with 4 refill toothbrush heads (including the one to start with, so 3 extra ones). This toothbrush is somehow similar to the Sonic toothbrush, it shakes and doesn't rotate. It comes with a charger and a USB/ USB-C adapter… but I am very confused why we need the adapters….I was using oral B earlier and perhaps I got used to the brush rotating by itself. When using the Fairywill sonic electric toothbrush at first, I wasn't too used to it and I feel it's less powerful than my oral B. However, after using it for a week, I do appreciate it being a little ""lighter"" overall than the oral B. This toothbrush vibrates. When put in between your tooth, it will ""shake"" all the food out.

I've been looking for a toothbrush for a while and stumbeld upon this one. The pricing was very fair considering the amount of items that came with the toothbrush.I received 4 heads and a travel case that arrived packaged very elegantly. I've been usign this toothbrush twice a day for 2 weeks straight and the battery is still going strong. There are 3 different modes than have a built-in 2 minute timer, however, my favourite mode is mode 3 (as in the video) where the bristles oscillate up and down doing most of the work for you. The toothbrush has a very premium feel to it, and isn't too thick or heavy making it very ergonomic to use.A couple things to consider for best use. If you haven't used an electric toothbrush before, make sure you brush some toothpaste onto your teeth prior to starting the electric brush.One nice to have would be an easy charging stand or cradle, however, this is not a big takeaway from the package.Overall, I've noticed a much cleaner feeling and brighter smile! I have been incredibly impressed with the value that a tooth brush at this price offers.

I am really surprised with all the 5-star reviews. It seems like are compensated reviews or sellers own people writing the reviews NOT the actual reviews. The only good thing about this product is the packaging. It comes in a very formal box like you have purchased a very expensive electronic product. The excitement ends then and there only. The brush makes so much noise that it could work as an alarm clock as well. Bristles are not soft, it will go harsh on the gums. The only thing as per the design it vibrates. it does not give you a sense of cleaning the teeth as it bristles are very far away from each other, there is a lot of gap in the core. It does not have pressure sensor. The electric brush should tell you when you are putting more pressure on the teeth. The battery will not last more than 20 days even after a full charge of 2 hours, whereas it claims to work for 30 days. It will not.NO, It is not for traveling a lot, it has a complicated box which is huge and bulky.

This is the second sonic toothbrush I have got. My first one was amazing. It's the only tooth brush I'll ever use now.You know that fresh feeling you get from a cleaning at the dentist? well similar feeling after you brush with a sonic toothbrush! You won't go back, trust me.Suppose to last 30 days, but I find that they last more than a few months on a charge depending how long and frequently you brush your teeth. Another cool feature is the timer. You know you've been brushing for 30 seconds when it beeps. Basically 4 beeps is a full 2 min brush.Also has a really nice carrying case that my last one didn't have. I like that. :)

Been using this for 2 months, and from Day 1 until now, I feel that my teeth is cleaner and my gums are healthier looking for some reason.First of all, the packaging is nice. All the black boxes and the design of how to open it makes it feel premium (and prolly perfect as a gift). The package comes with 4 toothbrush heads already, which by standards will last a full year (yes, replace your toothburhs every 3 months). It also comes with a container for travelling which ive been using to visit my grandparents.The brush has three modes: strong, soft, and pulsing. I found the strong setting is too strong for me (it makes me feel dizzy or makes my gums numb), so i stick to the soft setting and havent changed it since.The toothbrush itself is smaller than the average toothbrush (see photos). I find that the brushing is more focused on like 1-3 teeth, than brushing the whole set entirely in one motion.The timer is also very useful. I never realise I brushed my teeth very fast before - now I take my whole 2 minutes (30 sexonds each area) upper left, upper right, lower left, lower right.The brush is also waterproof, so I just wash off the toothpaste scales off of it with water and it still works.After brushing, I notice my teeth is actually cleaner that if you scratch it with your nails, it has significantly less tartar than just brushing with a normal toothbrush.The only caveat I find is that it uses a round charger instead of USB C. All of my gadgets except for my smartwatch is using USB C.regardless of. The charging method, I am highly satisfied with this fairywill sonic toothbrush and I recommend it! :)

So far so good. The packaging is very good and feels like a high-end product when unboxing. I have only used it a few times so far, but it feels similar to a Philips Sonicare. It’s lightweight and easy to hold. The LED light ring isn’t well designed. Regardless of the mode, there is some backlight in all of the lights. Differentiating the mode from just the lights is difficult. The massage has a different feel so that’s easy enough. It remembers the last mode you used which is a plus. The value for money is great if it holds up for a few years.The case is nice and sturdy and will hold 2 brush heads.A note about the warranty. They claim 2 years in the Questions & Answers. This is not true. They provide a 1 year warranty and a 12 month extension if you register to join their VIP program (no charge). However, they will not show you anything to confirm this additional coverage. They just tell you to contact them if there are any issues. This is the main reason I have given only 4 stars. I found it misleading to tell people there is a 2 year warranty when that’s not the official manufacturer warranty listed in the manual. Since my credit card gives a 1-year extension, I don’t believe they will recognize this additional year, so I likely won’t be able to use this benefit. I was hoping for 3 years of coverage.I will update the review if there are any issues.

Background: This is my first electric toothbrush, I bought it as a gift as the presentation looked good in the pictures but then found out the person I was going to give it to already had an electric toothbrush, then I decided to keep it!Pros:1- Super premium packing -  I can honestly not believe that a toothbrush can be this well packed. It is so well packed that you will feel bad throwing the box away - I am keeping mine so far lol. Definitely gifting material for sure.2- Charging - it charges really fast and holds it for quite some time, I haven't had to charge mine for the past 10 days - my shaver and trimmer both don't last that long. (however to be fair they are both used longer each session)3- Comes with 4 heads, I imagine if one lasts me three months then I am good for a year with what came in the package, i'll contact the manufacturer for replacements after.4- Charger cable - i was able to squeeze it right into the case - but there is a con to it too - see below.5- extra accessory - the cable can double as your usb c or micro usb charger as it comes with a little accessory which turns the cable into any of those tools - however I have not tested the current delivery with those so I cannot in all fairness comment on how fast they will charge your phone.6- The main function is exactly what i expected - my teeth have never felt cleaner. I dont think the vibration is too strong or too light. It is just right.7- The timer function has really helped my improve my brushing habits, I think I was spending too much time brushing before and perhaps not giving equal attention to upper teeth. the half second gap between each quadrant has really helped me divide my time equally.Cons1- Since I haven't had a electric toothbrush before I can be completely off but I kind of feel that the device is huge are you going to take this or a regular toothbrush on your travel specially since all airlines now charge extra for luggage and space saving is a key during travel2- The case is also consequently huge.3- the case should have a place to actually properly store the cable which it does not. which leaves it prone to getting wet and dying on you.4- all the heads have same softness - not sure if other electric toothbrushes come in soft/hard etc - but I think they should. i

First of all, I'm a big fan of how the product is packaged.  I know it doesn't have any impact on how well it will actually work, but the thought put into the packaging is encouraging for the thought put into the product.Overall it's a nice toothbrush that will work just as well as the name brand competitors, cost less, and look better (imo).  Would recommend to anyone looking for a sonic toothbrush.Pros:- Great battery life, I used it for a week straight and haven't had to charge it or noticed any lower power- Fast vibrations, it feels like it's cleaning my teeth very well (who really knows though?)- Sleek design, it looks good in the hand or on your countertop- Convenient travel case- There's an adapter for the charging cable to allow you to charge your phone using the same cable.Cons:-Replacement toothbrush heads might be a bit harder to come by-The toothbrush has to be plugged in to charge, it doesn't have a wireless charging stand-I think the travel case could be a bit smaller-Can't charge with USB C or micro USB

Nice electric toothbrush that doesn't break the bank. Favorite part of this toothbrush is oddly the packaging, it feels like an apple product with its packaging. The toothbrush itself is not bad, not the fanciest, but it gets the job done. The girth of the toothbrush makes it a little awkward to hold and takes some getting used to. The selftimer is a life changer, keeps me brushing at precisely 2 minutes. Overall I would say that I is a decent toothbrush, definitely a nice gift to give. I have had this toothbrush for over a month now and stop have yet to charge it, so the battery life is definitely good.

 Although it was a longer wait to received this item upon ordering, understandably because of the Covid issue, still the wait was worth it.First impression last - packaging was superbContents were definitely a plus. Having 4 bristle heads and a toothbrush travel holder that is firm.The brushing with the use of the motor helps a lot and feels confidently clean after use.Easy to store in the toothbrush holder.Charges fast and charges well- last long - in fact i haven't charge it again yet, since it arrived.
"

This is THE toothbrush! First I was impressed with award, design and price so I purchased after I couldn't find replacement heads for my last sonic. It arrived in a classy black box that closes with magnet and the toothbrush is extremely attractive and comfortable to hold. I have sensitivity only when getting my teeth cleaned with hygienist, never from brushing but I need to use this on lowest setting or I get too sensitive, and still brightened my smile a couple lvls after just 3 days!  Extremely happy with my purchase and highly recommend.

I dont know how can people use this thing , its vibration is much too powerful to place on your teeth , even if you hardly let it touch your teeth.The vibration sensation is very uncomfortable on the mouth in general , even when placing it in ""soft"" mode. Modes are difficult to set due to the mechanism of having to touch the power button to set the modes up.Very disappointed with the purchase, over priced piece of junk.EDIT May 29,2020: The seller contacted me and we worked out the issues I have mentioned.  I appreciate the courtesy of the customer service team.

I'm very happy with this toothbrush and how well it works! After using it for a few weeks, I feel it has made a difference to my oral health. It feels like my teeth are a lot smoother right after brushing. I have braces, so the smaller head of the toothbrush is perfect to get around the tight spaces, an feels much less awkward use around the brackets. The 3 extra replacement heads were a good addition, especially since the brushes tend to wear out a lot faster with braces.The packaging was surprisingly very nice, like gift-worthy nice. Only thing is that I wish the charging port wasn't at the very bottom, since I have to lay the toothbrush of the table to charge it (instead of upright like some others). But the battery life has been pretty good, so at least it doesn't have to be charged too often. Overall though, I think it is a great investment!
"
"
Wow! I am amazed at the packaging, it was very beautiful and sleek! It comes with multiple replacement heads, the charging cable, the base and a travelling case. The travelling case is actually double ended where you can carry another replacement head, good if you're sharing this toothbrush! Battery life has been very good, still in my first full charge after 1 week of use. It is not very loud and it comes with a few vibration modes for different kinds/ level of cleaning. Overall, super satisfied!

I like taking care of my teeth as much as I can. The P11 is really good at getting out those tiny particles that a regular toothbrush can’t. It comes 4 heads so it’s like buying 4 toothbrush’s it’s has a nice compartment to carry it with for travel or stay over. The price is higher than the ones you get from Walmart (for example) but this one is more powerful and it’s chargeable and slimmer a than any of 12$ supermarkets one no need for batteries, and that ps a big deal. It uses a usb cable so you can charge it easily anywhere you want. It’s also cheaper by like 50% than Chargeable high end one.

Can't say more about how pleased we are with this toothbrush after a month of use. Hubby and I both had the Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes that lasted 15 years and they were excellent. Fast forward to 2020 and try and find the same quality in an electric toothbrush from what used to be reputable companies and you reach a void. Not only are they way more expensive, they are garbage. Tried an Oral B and of course it would not recharge after 1.5 months.  My new moto has been stay away from companies that have been around forever because they have taken to selling crap.Went back onto Amazon and came across this sonic toothbrush with great reviews and at a good price. Came with a travel case that is invaluable to us. As other reviewers noted, comes really nicely packaged with everything you need (several extra tips) and the initial impression is this is a product of quality. Started using the toothbrush and this was confirmed. Was our first sonic so it took a bit of getting used to. First thought, this is lasting an amazing long time with both of us using it and didn't need a charge (after each using twice a day for 30 days time to recharge). Tips are easily interchangeable which is great. It is perfect weighted and the right size to fit in your hand for comfortable use. I could say that consideration could be given to adding some texture to the brush as with the smooth finish and wet hand did lose hold a couple of times. But it is a great product. Did contact the company about registering as per card enclosed and they respond very quickly, and give you the impression of really trying hard to make a good product and provide great customer service. Have no worries that if there ever was an issue they would be there for you.Thank you Fairywill for taking the high road in exemplifying that with intent a company can choose to make a good product at a great price and be profitable that way versus selling garbage to the masses. Will highly recommend your product to everyone I know. Look forward to using this unit for a long time.
"

The presentation of this product was really impressive. It comes in a nice box and the toothbrush itself also looks great. The power delivery is nice and it feels like other more expensive brands. It is compact enough to bring with me while travelling and comes with spare brush heads to use if needed. The only real downside is the charging port uses a special plug and if you lose that cable it may be hard to find a replacement. However for the price it is a good product.
"
"
I used other electronic toothbrushes but I really didn’t like it but I bought fairywill toothbrush and I loved it . I really like this product. Because it’s very useful, easy, comfortable. Fairly There are 4 brush heads. I was surprised to see travel case it’s very useful, it can be charged and it is waterproof. It’s stays charged for a long time. It’s comes with USB charging cable. Also colour is very cool. It seem stylish.
"
"
The toothbrush comes with a rechargeable battery and three different modes to fancy upon. The product comes with nice, elegant packaging and provides an overall premium feel to it. Box includes extra/replaceable brush heads which I believe should easily last you a year or more. Having a travel case is a bonus, can carry it anywhere without much hassle. Bristles are also very soft and don’t hurt gums, unlike other toothbrushes. The P11 toothbrush also has an integrated handle that keeps residue and mildew from reaching any component parts keeping the toothbrush clean from any germs and mildew. Also, battery seems to last long, using it for more than a week now, and haven’t done a recharge yet. I would recommend this product to everyone. A great buy!

Bought it as a gift for my little sister. Super satisfied with it on hand.Actually, I did not expect that much when buying, but when the package arrived, I was very surprised.According to what she said, it worked very well, compact, lightweight designed, IPX7 waterproof function. It is used sonic vibrating tech, giving comfortable and, suitable for sensitive teeth, not like mechanical vibrating brushes. Multiple vibration modes and functions!!!
"
"
This is an amazing toothbrush that comes with all features I need in order to keep my teeth and gum in good health.  It comes with 3 brushing modes which include: Clean, Soft, and Massage.  It has IPX7 waterproof housing and I like it's hidden display system which prevents any residue from being mildew and molded.  Also, it takes only two hours to recharge in full and good for about 30 days of use.
"
"
Replaced a Sonicare I probably had for over 5 years. My old one was definitely not performing like this new one! I think I made an upgrade with this replacement. The old one had the 3 modes for sensitive, clean, massage... this new one has clean, whitening and gum... 3 intensity levels and a pulsing indicator when you're pressing too hard.Nice travel box included and it doesn't allow foam and residue to get inside of your toothbrush. I have used it for 3 days and only charged it once.
"
"
My mouth has never felt so clean!! This toothbrush is amazing!! I love the feel of it while it is cleaning. The slim design is so comfortable and easy to manipulate. The timer is an added bonus! The charge lasts for a very long time. And the packaging is so beautiful!! Oh and the travel case is such a perfect addition! So appreciated! Love love love this product!!!
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush. I was bit skeptical of buying this but had to upgrade to electric toothbrush so went ahead and purchase.It is really easy to use this brush.Just press the button and move your hand. Its been few days I am using it and i can feel the difference. It came with the multiple brush heads. It has a different brushing mode so that you can choose one which is suitable for your gums and teeth.Feeling fresh.
"
"
I have been using  the product for now 10 says and  I can already feel the change. I was always skeptical of using electric brush since they are expensive as well. When I came across this online with a reasonable price, i thought of giving it a try. It was different the first few days but now I am hooked. As soon as I am done brushing, it get a cleaner feeling. The brush is extremely easy on my teeth and easy to move around.  I also love the timer so I know that I am done.  Its really worth it
"
"
Bristles are soft and and leave my gums feeling refreshed instead of hurting the motion I'm going up and down is more natural and I feel it gives me a way better clean the materials are premium and it gives a premium feel. The charge can last pretty much forever I felt. You can't go wrong with the value this brush gives you...
"
"
My experience is overall excellent. To break it down. First, delivery was fast (free delivery option) by arriving within 2 days. Amazon delivery used Intercom to deliver to my door. Second, packaging was impressive. Opening the box was a positive and unexpected fun experience. Seems packaged like high value devices. Third, usage was a breeze. Once you attach the head's toothbrush, you can use it with no battery charging required.Up until now, I've personally used well-known brands for electric toothbrushes. This time, I told myself, why not try it. Now, I'm so happy I did.
"
"
I use the electronic toothbrush many years. My old one needed to be  replaced  since the battery was gone bad. I choses this one because good reviews and price, also it comes with extra brush head.  I really satisfy with my decision. The delivery was very quickly and design was very nice and fancy as picture. It work very well. I feel like this is better than any other main brand. It definitely recommended.
"
"
This is an amazing product from my point of view.It comes in a very nice box with the different parts well packed.I love that comes with four replaceable head brushes, first time I see that in a brush.The material fees strong and durable. I have it more than a week ago. I charged it the day I received it and is still working with that same charge so the battery holds good power.It has a nice setting which stroke nicely and clean my teeth nicely, I’m personally in love with this brush and recommend to others.Update: I received the toothbrush on April 7th, that day I charged it and only until today May 17 I had to recharged it. I’m definitely in love with this product.
"
"
I was very impressed with how clean my teeth felt even after the first use. It is so soft and flexible and so easy to reach every corner of my mouth. Nice design and battery life is also Good. Smart timer is great. I like the 30 second reminder for cleaning each area. So far, it's working great for my sensitive teeth.
"
"
I'm not a fan of electric toothbrushes but after I tried this product, I don't think I'd go back to using a regular toothbrush ever! It is so powerful that it leaves my teeth feeling like I've been to a dentist.This just came at the right timing when I can't go out to my dental cleaning appointment due to the pandemic. Very fast delivery! Ordered it Sunday and got the package Tuesday.The product is placed on a very elegant packaging.Comes with extra brushes to last you a year if you change brushes every 3months. Also, the brush.. ohhh the bristles are so soft! It doesn't hurt my gums unlike it did sometimes with the regular toothbrush.Really great performance!You can even bring it anywhere with you as it comes with a charging cable and you can use with your powerbank and a 2-type usb connector.I will definitely recommend this to family and friends!Very worth the price.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I've always used electric ones but they only ever had one setting and required so many batteries, but this one is rechargeable and has 3 different modes. It feels like a super deep clean. It looks very fancy too, even just the box looked nice. The fact that it has a built-in timer that pauses to let you know to switch to another part of the mouth is awesome too. The fact that it came with extra heads so I don't have to go out and buy more for a while is cool too.
"
"
I wanted to switch to an electric toothbrush from a long time but wanted to try something cheap. So I found this on amazon. It’s pretty handy and looks wise is good. So far it’s really great on battery. The grip is good and it doesn’t fall off from hands. It’s waterproof..... I tried it in my shower. The good thing is that you can feel the difference in cleaning after using electric toothbrush. All day along you feel your mouth,teeth are clean. I don’t have enough words to describe the feel I get after using electric toothbrush.
"
"
WonderfulI was just wowww when i unboxed this beauty and luxury package. I love their packaging.There is 4 brush in the package that is enough for about 6 months . Every thing is ok, battery life is good but i wish there was a wireless charging for more comfort 😉
"
"
I love this tooth brush! It has a really good battery life, brushes really well (but not too harshly) and is really easy and pleasant to hold. The travel case that it comes with is really sleek too, and the extra heads that come with it will maker sure I don’t have to buy any extra brush heads for at least a year! I would definitely recommend to anybody. It matches the quality of some electric toothbrushes that are 5x the price!
"
"
I just got it yesterday and I loved it the way it cleans. I had Phillips sonic and that is now 3 years old and it was not working properly. This brush works same way as Philips but half of the price. So far I loved it I will update about battery life and quality later.
"
"
I was somehow trying to give less starts, but this really check out for good stars at all places. I've been using it for like 10 days and believe me, it's working pretty well. I upgraded from a cheap electric brush and you can feel a difference. The good thing is that, for the price I got 4 heads with a rechargeable battery which other brands charger a lot for. I'd say, use it and there shouldn't be any issues
"
"
This is my first electronic toothbrush after advised from doctor. Comes with many brush attachments and tips, will be able to use the brushes for years before having to buy replacement brushes. Battery life is great, not too loud when it's on either. The unit is easy to hold and brushes teeth way better then a regular tooth brush!
"
"
I was reluctant to try something new, thought to give it a go and i am pleasantly surprised to receive a premium quality electric toothbrush. The packaging itself makes it awesome, felt like opening the new iphone, lol. Design is pretty basic, no fancy stuff but who cares if it does the job better than the rest. Couple of hours charging could last very long, i mean super long. The brush comes with 4 heads and travel case as well and its water proof too!. No regrets what so ever.  
"
"
The toothbrush is pretty cool. As soon as I saw the package I was like ""WOW"". It is very stylish. The box includes toothbrush, charger, travel box and three additional brushes. I've been using it for a while and I like it. If you need a present for a loved one, it would be a good purchase.
"
"
The product is really good looking and at the same time performs really good.It comes with three different modes according to your requirements and preferences.and i personally liked the last brush mode which moves up and down and also left right.And most impressive part is that the battery last more then week if you brush 2 times a day.it’s literally same weight as normal brush but  u gonna feel some weight however, because of it’s end is round it’s balanced.

Really love how beautiful and portable this toothbrush is. I love the design and it makes brushing my teeth more fun. The package was beautiful and there's even a case  to keep the toothbrush. It's fairly quite to use. It holds a charge and you don't need to charge it every night although I do it because it is just easier. I love how neatly it is packaged. You could probably give this as a gift if you want. I am happy with it!
"
"
Excellent! I am glad to buy this product, it is very beautiful! It comes with multiple replacement heads, the charging cable, the base and a travelling case. Because of the travelling case it makes your life much more comfortable and convenient and the case has another spot where you can carry another replacement head. Me and my wife both can use these. It has a longer battery life that has been very good, still in my first full charge after 1 week of use. . Overall, I am really satisfied!
"
"
Amazing electric toothbrush! It has a long battery life. It is very light and very easy to use. It was neatly packaged in a box! It has usb wire for charging, and also has replacement brushes. It cleans my teeth really well. I love using this everyday.
"
"
Been using this for about 2 weeks now and i was using an Oral-B electric tooth brush for almost 3 years now and switched to this one for a change. It's been working great and I have sensitive gums and it works great so far. Would recommend it.
"
"
Been using for a short time now. Works exactly as I hoped. Battery life is great, looks really nice. Came with 4 extra brushes so wont need to buy any for a while. The travel case is perfect for putting in after use and putting away so that it doesn’t get dirty. Would highly recommend this item to anybody that needs a new electric toothbrush. Great value.
"
"
It is an excellent quality toothbrush which comes in a beautiful packing. I have been using it since ten days and my interdental cavities are much cleaner now. The brush vibrations are strong and powerful with a good battery life. The travel carry case is a plus point with extra brush heads that comes with this. Overall a good deal to grab.
"
"
Cleans the teeth impeccably. Love the pulse timer that goes off every 30 seconds until 2 mins pass. Love that it took over a month to need a recharge. Well worth the money. Best toothbrush I ever had. Getting my hubby one later this year.
"
"
Omg! This toothbrush is amazing! It is classy, stylish and has a firm grip. The rpm count is also very high, hence it is very powerful. Battery seems to last long. It comes with a travel case - which is extremely handy.I highly recommend. It is much better than other expensive brushes in the market
"
"
I had an oscillating electric toothbrush that has been with me for years so I thought to retire it. I spend a considerable time looking for a sonic toothbrush but I did not want to spend a lot of money on a new one.  I was pleasantly surprised when I received it. Not only it was designed very well with a nice carrying case and quite compact to travel with. It has the highest number of vibrations per minute that I could find on the market and I definitely feel that my teeth are cleaner.
"
"
This toothbrush is extremely comfortable to use! It’s lightweight in your hand and gentle on the teeth. It lets you know when you switch quadrants your brushing and has the 2 minute timer as well as 3 different brushing settings. Love that it comes with a a travel case and is ADA approved.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush, so although I don’t have anything to compare it to, I really like this! Easy to set up and use.Also, gotta say, the package and design is on point.
"
"
This toothbrush is great. The price is good , way lower than other toothbrushes I was looking at . The packaging is extremely nice , seems very high end . Brush works great , seems powerful and the 3 settings are nice .
"
"
I wasn't sure when I bought this item, whether or not it would be good quality. But after having used it for a week, I can tell you that it feels quite sturdy and it feels good to use.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it. The sonic toothbrush has a simple design which is easy to hold and use. I also like that it's waterproof which also prevents any foam or residue getting inside the toothbrush. I can clean it without any worries. And it comes with a stylish travel case.
"
"
This toothbrush is great for travel. It comes with a small powerbank for those long trips. I was pleasantly surprised with how elegant the product packaging was.
"
"
The brush on the toothbrush swivels at a very high rate and it cleans the teeth thoroughly. There are 3 modes which are very good, especially the massage mode. It is suitable for use with any age and the toothbrush feels premium and has a very good built quality.
"
"
Very easy to use. I loved the packaging as it made the toothbrush feel like a royal electric toothbrush. Nice presentation. Nice color and good battery life. I love the timer that tells you when to switch quadrants of your mouth and it shuts off exactly after 2mins. My teeth feel very well polished like I just came from the dental office.
"
"
I was surprised by the quality and the premium feels when I opened the box, at its price point.There are three modes to choice from as advertised.The matte finish and each packaging, showed in the pic, give a nice touch. I tried the toothbrush out and its feels the same as other named brand. if I am making the choice again, I would order the this one again!
"
"
J'aime que la brosse à dent ne devint pas sale après utilisation. Le produit arrive emballé et présenté de manière luxueuse. La batterie tient longtemps comparée à une ORALB de faible qualité.  Je suis très très satisfaite de ce produit. Attention, pas le même nettoyage qu'une ORALB. Beaucoup plus doux, mais efficace.
"
"
This is the first time I am using an electric toothbrush. But I have to say that it has changed the whole toothbrushing experience for me. Using it for few days. I mostly love the massage function. The packaging looked premium and the portable carrier for the device and brish is beautiful.
"
"
Delivery was rapid! And delivered on a Sunday. As for the toothbrush so far so good, can't really comment on battery life yet but will come back in a month and update, accessories and device itself seem solid - 1 thing I wish for the next version is wireless charging.
"
"
I used to have a rotating electric toothbrush but this is a different ball game all together. The bristles move very fast and make sure it not only cleans my teeth, but massages my gums thoroughly. Happy with the purchase
"
"
I bought this toothbrush for my wife. Had great battery life, easy to hold. Also the best feature which I don't find in other electric toothbrush is that it has three modes. One of them is massage which my wife likes very much.
"
"
Durable ,fiable ,design magnifique, grandeur de la brosse plus grande que l'autre version de la meme compagnie, poil moyen et non pas souple, ce qui est très agréable pour le brossage. L'étais de voyage permet 2 têtes pour un manche vraiment génial !!
"
"
Very nice toothbrush.The cover makes it very convenient to use, to clean and to store.The different vibration modes is ideal to make it comfortable when brushing.Been using it for a week now and I still didn't have to charge the batteries again. It seems like it could go again for a long time.Very satisfied.
"
"
This is better than my sonic which I used for a year. Variable spin speed and firm bristles. Jùst one charge and its 2nd week now.
"
"
Oh my god! this is so awesome. It's like a super soft massage to your gums, it feels so nice I don't want to stop brushing and I just want to go brush my teeth again. It cleans really well too. Just so cool! Thank you Fairywill
"
"
The product is very much worth the price!! The contents and the way they are packed is very nice!! The brush has 3modes to help cleanse your teeth!! I would definitely recommend this product for everyone wishing to buy electronic toothbrush!!
"
"
Pour le prix, de très bonne qualité. Vient avec un une boite de transport pour le voyage. Après le brossage, vous avez une bonne sensation de propreté.
"
"
It is having three mode to clean your teeth as you wanted making it suitable for perfect cleaning. Very easy to use with setting the modes. Comes with four heads for long time use. charging lasts longer.
"
"
I have been using the electric tooth brush for 25 days and it’s worth the money ,has good battery life .Comes with a travel case and 3 replacement brush heads.
"
"
It is not first time to use electronic touthbrush. I like it. It is easy to use. Good for traveling. The battery is great comparing with what I had before. It is not heavy . I hope it still same power for long term.
"
"
Needed an electronic toothbrush after getting recommendation by a dentist, giving this a shot as the price is right. It comes with multiple replacement brushheads which is nice, I like the black colour it stands out from my wife's pink one.
"
"
I have tried several electronic toothbrushes and have never like any until this. It does what it’s supposed to and haven’t given me any problems and gentle enough for my teeth, gums and tongue.
"
"
Great sonic tooth brush. Super light and great long lasting battery.  This toothbrush is sealed so no residue will get inside and i can wash easily.
"
"
Very nice product with a long battery life. I haven't had to recharge it ever since I bought it. It's very compact and easy to store.
"
"
I got my toothbrush in the mail and I tried it right aways! I love it and never want to use a non-electric toothbrush ever again! Quality is great and it's super stylish!
"
"
A month has passed since I used the electric toothbrush, it is still working! Haven’t charge the electric toothbrush yet. Grip of the handle is good and it doesn’t slip.
"
"
Amazing quality. Definitely not disappointed. Beautiful product
"
"
I feel better comfort while fairywill sonic electric brush using tooth brush than other brandSecondly with the Battery life 🔋 - Fast Sustained Charge
"
"
A good value set - comes with a travel case along with 4 toothbrush heads. The package looks and feels very royal-like. Perfect as a gift.
"
"
I loved this purchase as it works amazing and the battery last long. It comes with extra set of bristle heads and it’s worth the buy. Very sleek and elegant design.
"
"
It was a good price and will see if it functions well over time
"
"
This toothbrush is absolutely amazing. It brushes well the quality is great come with everything you need to travel and with head replacements a definite must buy
"
"
I love this toothbrush! It doesn't compare to any other ones I have tried.Its amazing and super friendly
"
"
Super produit fonctionne tres bien
"
"
Mom is happy and voiced no complaints
"
"
I have used a few well known brand electric toothbrushes in past and hands down this one has got the most power of them all. Its charger can connect to even a laptop is just amazing.
"
"
What more can you ask for?

Good clean feel after.  Vibrations are strong so needed an adjustment period
"

Such good value and good quality!!! Looks better than any other toothbrush.  Very light in weight.  :)

It is the best tools to clean up the teeth.
"

Powerful brush, rapid movement, 3 modes, great for everyday brushing.

I've been in discussion with Fairywill because I wasn't happy about the earlier model I purchased here on Amazon, the FW507. As a result, they invited me to try out this newer model, the P11. Well, I can tell you I find the P11 a significant improvement. I'm a writer and I know every first draft needs an improved next draft, and, to me, that's what the P11 is -- a better draft. It has fewer, simpler controls than its predecessor and seems to be built sturdier and with better components. It's nearly as good as the Oral B I've been using the last few months, plus it has the big advantage being about half the price of that device. So, the P11 is a fine value, and it gets your teeth clean, too! My only small criticism (and the reason I didn't give the P11 five stars) is that I find the power cable a bit of a drag. I wasn't crazy about about the the compact USB cable and power input on my old FW507 (compact USBs are fiddly to connect), but at least if you lost a cable you could get a replacement just about anywhere.  If you lose the power cable on the P11 with it unique tip, you'll have to order a replacement from Fairywill, or go hunting for a compatible one at an electronics store or online. I suggest Fairywill switches the USB C format for charging cables and inputs on their next model. Easy to connect and easy to replace missing cords. Overall, though, as I said above, the cable/input thing is a small criticism. The P11 is well worth buying.

"
I received my order few days ago and i was surprised of the lovely packaging and the quality of the product. I fully charged the battery and tried it...i can tell you that it is very comfortable to hold and to brush, the multi speed helps you clean well and do kind of gum massage. I gave it 5 stars because it deserves it on all levels: Design, quality & efficiency. You can gift this package to someone you love without any hesitation.
"
"
I bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. He prefers to do manual brushing but since using this he is now converted!First of is the packaging, we were impressed how an electronic toothbrush would be packaged nicely. It’s something that you can put in unboxing videos you see in youtube.  The toothbrush, travel case and packaging were very stylish! I also tried the toothbrush for myself and i was also impressed. I’m currently using an oral B toothbrush and now i’m thinking of getting another one of this for myself. It is more quiet and comfortable to grip.
"
"
My dentist always tell me to invest for an electric toothbrush.But electric toothbrush are so expensive until i found this sonic toothbrush in Amazon.First i did a research, read the reviews and  bought the product, after using it for a day i really feel the difference of using an electric toothbrush form a regular toothbrush.Electric toothbrush clean better than regular toothbrush and it feels good too, the vibrations are not too strong and it really cleans your teeth well.There is a feature that i which give you 30 seconds every quadrant of your teeth so that you wont damage your teeth for using the toothbrush for so long.The recommended time is 2 minutes for the whole teeth and giving you too 3 modes so that if you want a stronger vibrations for some parts of the teeth that you want to clean more.I really love this toothbrush it comes with a travelling case and 4 toothbrush heads, packaging is very good, its not like a cheap version of these expensive electric toothbrush.Will surely recommend this toothbrush to my friends and family
"
"
I was very surprised when I saw the packaging for this toothbrush, it looked like I was getting gold jewelry. The packaging and design of the toothbrush is very classy and looks and feels expensive. 10/10 on the design and quality.The toothbrush comes with a charger, and they provide an adapter that allows you to charge microUSB devices or USB type C devices when you are not charging the toothbrush. That was a very nice addition!I have not owned another electrical toothbrush, so I don't have a baseline to compare it to, but it does the job. It has various settings for those with sensitive teeth. I'm happy with the quality and performance of the brush. The set comes with 4 brush heads, and a carrying case as well which could come in handy when traveling.Overall very pleased with this product!
"
"
The toothbrush looks very premium quality when you see and open the box. It comes along with spare 3 brush heads. It has 3 modes of brushing your teeth. The best part of this electric toothbrush is battery life..it's just amazing I don't need to charge it again and again. Also the teeth cleaning efficiency is just terrific. It comes along with travel case. I would recommend this product to my friends and yes now this toothbrush is become the most important part of my dental hygiene.
"
"
Im so happy i bought this toothbrush!!...its my first electronic one and can see that my teeth are actually clean!! so much plaque was starting to build up due to my regular toothbrush...! This is a great quality brush  and the battery was charged very quickly which was super convenient and it lasts too....it is very quiet yet powerful and i love the travel case it comes with! Also, it comes with 3 extra heads.
"
"
Finding a perfect toothbrush is hard. But I came across this one here that sounded promising, with a very good price. It works perfectly as described. Lasts for very long without charging it, sits easily on the charging station, comes with 4 changeable heads for the brush. Cleans my teeth very well and thoroughly.
"
"
This is first time changed to electric toothbrush and first impression was great. Recharged first time and its working from last 8 days and using it daily basis. The head is small and it goes to last tooth and cleans properly. Four additional heads comes with pack.
"
"
Very efficient and functional toothbrush
"
"
The item arrived in good condition and the battery seems new.  Sometimes these electric toothbrushes no matter the brand tend to be strong motors or brushing.  So brush your teeth light until the motor calms down or the mechanism.  I wonder if these ever come with a speed control as it should be gentle brushing not winning a race by speed.
"
"
I almost bought an expensive power toothbrush. Then I realized with our tiny bathroom it wouldn’t work very well with a corded one that had to be charged. I’m amazed at the power this one has and best of all, if anything goes wrong it’s affordable to replace. Would buy again.
"
"
Wish it were easy to change a battery. It's compact size is great to handle & pack.
"
"
I've had battery operated brushes before, and found this one to work so much better
"
"
Oral-B used to be good. This purchase made me rethink this. Just opened it and it won't turn on ! Perhaps it was a return that was repackaged as new (it seemed to be missing a plastic cover on the brush that drugstore version seems to have)? This has never happened before. Wish I had opened it right away and not waited till it was time to replace my old toothbrush, as now it says the return window passed. I hope someone contacts me as this brush is very clearly defective- even the button intended to press to turn on doesn't function or indent when pressing like it's supposed to, like an electric toothbrush typically works! $9 wasted- did not expect this level of quality from Oral-B. The battery inside is also questionable, appears to be a counterfeit duracell. Very disappointing experience.
"
"
I bought this for my dogs because they hate the Sonicare. It’s working well to keep their teeth and gums clean. They don’t like it but they don’t hate it either.  It’s a necessity!
"
"
Dommage que ces pas la bonne couleur.  C'était bleu et la elle est rose.  Bon là prochaine fois j'écrirai au vendeur avant.
"

My preferred toothbrush.

Really happy with this purchase. Battery came with tooth brush. One powerful electric brush. Does the job nicely. 5 stars. Came packaged nicely, quick shipping.

great for getting your teeth really clean and massaging the gumsThe bristles are soft so its perfect for a quick brush after meals toowill buy again
"
"
You get what you pay for I guess, but this really is the worst toothbrush. It is SO loud and obnoxious. The brush head is so big and thick that when you’re brushing, you can’t keep the toothpaste inside your mouth.. very messy.
"
"
Nice thootbrush for the price
"
"
This is probably the cheapest electric toothbrush out there from a well-known brand. Works well and cleans the inner parts of the mouth. Honestly, for the price, I have zero complaints.
"
"
Can not beat the price or quality.
"
"
Love that it already comes with a battery. Besides that it's an effective toothbrush nothing crazy.
"
"
Easy to use, small not bulky, great massage for the gums and vibrates to remove plague, requires no effort at all just let the brush do the job
"
"
Comparing with another two Colgate products, this product is much more better.
"
"
Great travel tooth brush. You can buy a travel case for it.
"
"
Bought 2 and one doesn't work anymore even with fresh batteries
"
"
Its a cheap product, I like it. My teeth are very clean.
"
"
Very usefull and good quality
"
"
Works well
"
"
Love it
"
"
Only drawback if that I ordered a blue one and received a pink one... But it makes no difference to my teeth :-)
"
"
A really good product! Way better then my older electric toothbrush. I honestly recommend this product.

Ran out of batteries very quickly. Didn't find it very powerful to begin with.
"

I bought 2, one for my wife and one for my self. Both work great! Love it!
"
"
Conforme à la description.. La meme se vend à la pharmacie à prix double
"

I love it 😍😍😍
"

N’a pas l’air d’être le produit original
"

Great for the price!
"
"
Very loud!!!
"
"
Broken package when delivered.
"
"
Junk! Bought mine around Christmas and Broke by February. Contacted the company but without my receipt I’m out of luck. Who keeps a toothbrush receipt? Anyway the company is fighting hard to keep their $8 so I’ll never buy another of their products.
"
"
Doesn’t spin. Just vibrates.
"
"
I love this toothbrush!!  It's so much better than the Colgate or Arm & Hammer models.  Both of those stopped working in less than a month.  Colgate was in about 2 weeks.  I had bought another Colgate one to replace it but it also lasted less than a month.  I bought this Oral-B for myself 4 months ago and it's still going strong.  So I bought one for the hubby and he loves it too.  I do find that we actually brush longer using this toothbrush.
"
"
Good price does what an electric toothbrush is supposed to do. Bristles are soft yet firm enough to clean teeth and gums
"
"
Been a couple of days I'm using it and so far I'm satisfied. Will see about durability but overall cleans very well.
"
"
It's been less that a month since i got this toothbrush and have replaced the battery 3 times. finally, it just stopped working, even with a fresh battery. tossed it!
"
"
Does a great job, easy to use, good value and the battery is easily replaceable. Highly recommended.
"
"
One of the best battery toothbrushes I have used. Great quality for price.
"
"
A bit noisy but does the job
"
"
Perfect, thank you!
"
"
As described.
"
"
Nice product with a light price.
"
"

"
"
Rarely do I ever give a 5 star review ..but this one deserves it. For the price you are getting a brush that would cost many times more a few years ago. Basic functions but it's a great brush..does the job well with minimal effort .
"
"
I used to use the sonicare diamond clean and although this is not as luxury as diamond clean looks,  I still prefer the this over it for long years of use.with the sealed silicone power button, water won’t be able to go in to build up gunk and smell. Longer battery life, 14 days I think. And a sturdier brush because of the curling connector pin.
"
"
I previously had on of the more expensive Sonicares that stopped working and then replaced it with this model.  If you only ever use the regular brush function this is all you need at a fraction of the cost.  I will definitely be buying these from now of as the life of the Sonicare handle has been roughly 2 years for me.  $30 for 2 years seems pretty reasonable.
"
"
I was always on the fence about powered toothbrush. Thought of them as a gimmick.But, but the bullet as they were on sale for C$25.  And I am glad I did.These clean my teeth like I visited a dentist. My mouth feels clean, gums are doing good.Very satisfied with these. I don’t need the extra Bluetooth and wifi features. This seems to meet all my needs.
"
"
This is my third sonicare toothbrush, I love them! This one was an excellent price, the only issue is the battery doesn't seem to be as great as ones I've had in the past.
"
"
My only complaints are that the brush head is a little small and I hate the quad spacer function. But these are just my own personal preferences. Otherwise, this toothbrush does an amazing job. Good value for the money!
"
"
Very affordable and gently cleans as advertised.  Much less expensive than buying it at the dentist office and does what it is designed to do.
"
"
We bought two, and the products arrived on time; we tried, like them, they are much better than those we bought in Walmart
"
"
Too messy, once I  turn it on...it splatter  all over the mirror etc.
"

My first elcetric toothbrush....i love it!

Works as well as my previous one.

Bought as a gift. No complaints.  A home run.

Works every bit as good as the higher priced models I have used
"

works as intended
"

Works just as well as way more expensive toothbrushes!

Works great. Bought it after I read the reviews and considered the price.

Nothing to dislike! Its working as its supposed to be.

Well worth it for the price !

Does the job well. But brush heads are quite expensive.

This is a great beginner entry for those who need a cheaper sonic toothbrush option, or who aren’t sure if they will like sonic. I have a super fancy sonic toothbrush and while it’s true that this won’t stand up to higher end models (obviously, they cost a lot more!)it's a big difference from a manual toothbrush. When compared to electric, you won’t feel the difference, but science says it’s more effective. This is the first time I’ve seen a sonic brush at such a low price point. While it describes itself as ‘electric’ in the listing, the box and packaging describe it as using sonic technology.If you’ve never used a sonic toothbrush, I advise you to watch a video as the brushing method is quite different from manual and you want to make sure you’re doing it correctly. The DailyClean brush is super bare bones compared to high end models, but it does everything you need for a good teeth clean. Like other Sonicares it ‘beeps’ in quadrants of cleaning and will turn off after the full length of brushing (so just keep brushing until it stops).The DailyClean has a nice long battery (always handy) of 14 days and only one button (turn on or off). Basically, it’s simple, easy and works! I will say that the handle is a bit chunkier than I expected, so if you have very small hands it might be difficult. While I don’t love the look of the silicone edging, I loved that the toothbrush didn’t slide around on my sink, it kept it from moving.Another thing that was new, was the shape of the brush. This brush has a strange ‘wiggly’ end to it, so I was worried it wouldn’t be compatible with the other Sonicares, but it still fits. In other words, you can buy any sonicare heads for this. I didn’t love the head here, I found it felt a bit plasticky compared to my luxury Sonicare, but I do like that you can replace it. I also found the bulbous bottom of the toothbrush head looked quite ugly.If you’re looking for a cheap beginner Sonicare, this is the one. It’s simple, effective and has a nice long battery life. While looks-wise and features-wise, it’s a lot less than a fancier Sonicare, it’s worth it to see if you like the Sonic range and definitely worth the cost!

The Philips Sonicare Daily Clean toothbrush has a small brush-head that I enjoy using.  It is an oval shape, similar to my traditional manual toothbrush.  The brush head snaps on, but I cannot seem to get it to form a tight seal on the handle.The toothbrush has a built-in two-minute timer that pauses each 30 seconds and at 2 minutes the toothbrush shuts off.The toothbrush comes with the charging base, brush head, handle and head protector.  The base is small and does not take up much valuable space on the bathroom counter.The handle is slender and fits comfortably in my hand.  The power button is on the front and there is a battery life indicator so you know when to charge your toothbrush again.The vibrations take some time to get accustomed to.  The toothbrush leaves my teeth feeling dentist clean.

I love Philips toothbrushes. That's all I've used for a while now, and I've also got my wife and kid using them, too. This is what my son started with, and it was a good first step. I don't think it does nearly as good a job as the DiamondClean series does, though, and would strongly advise you invest in a higher-end Philips brush handle, if you're going the electric toothbrush route. You won't regret it. This one is better suited as a travel brush, in my opinion. Keep it in your luggage and use it when you're away on a trip.

The toothbrush that I usually use is a Sonicare Expertcare 7500, a far pricier and more advanced version of this toothbrush. What Phillips has done is provided an affordable alternative in this toothbrush, priced at only $30 at the time of this review. I tried this with an open mind and can say that I am very impressed with the version that Philips has come up with!I was very happy with this toothbrush and how well it worked given that it is a budget version of a more expensive brush. Using this left my teeth feeling clean. The head is replaceable and this has a built-in timer to ensure that you are brushing for an appropriate amount of time. Although I prefer the heads included with my toothbrush, these rounded heads still make sure that each tooth gets the appropriate amount of cleaning.A big thank you to Philips for adding this electric toothbrush to their line up. This is so affordable that each member of your family can get the best tooth cleaning possible!

My preferred tooth brush is the Sonic care and I've had the opportunity to use a few different models throughout the years. I like this low priced version, super simple to use and no fancy frills to figure out.This is a simple and easy to use brush. There are no programming options or app connectivity to be concerned with. Simply charge it up and use. One button controls it and once in operation the 2 minute timer is divided up into 4 - 30 second segments. Every 30 seconds it changes the brushing monetarily by sort of buzzing to alert you its time to move on. This of course follows the suggested 2 minutes of brushing with 30 seconds being used per quarter of the mouth.I prefer the Sonic care over other brands that have a spinning head. Sonic care brush's have always given me a better clean, I never feel any left over plague build up when using them. Yes the original manufacturers brushes are expensive but there are a number of worthy after market brands which are much lower priced and still do an excellent job.The charging base used here is the same one found with the higher end Sonic care brushes, it's nice that they are interchangeable.The packaging suggests up to 14 days, or 28 sessions, of brushing on one charge, I got 24 brushing sessions (12 days) after each of the two charge cycles I've gone through. This is fine since its so simple to just place the brush on it's charger and pull it off when needed the next day.I can rinse the whole tooth brush under running water without worrying that water will get inside and short out the electronics. This makes clean up very easy.Overall this is a very nice low cost starter brush if you've never used an electric brush before and don't know if it will be for you but it's also a good solid every day long term brushing solution.

I have always had issues with my sensitive teeth and gums, plus my gums are predisposed to bleeding.Sometimes I was not able to brush my teeth second time in the evening so tender it was.Considering all that, I find Philips Sonicare Toothbrush to be perfect for me.Besides, Sonicare brushes so safe and gentle to teeth and gums that even my kids could use it, and loved the Sonicare sensation.After a week of using it at least twice per day, I had never had even one little bleeding.The toothbrush and attachments are on the pricey side, but in my case, it worth every penny.Some other great benefits:-- The toothbrush is rechargeable-- It's very well made and has a sturdy structure-- The size of the Sonicare brushes are great for kids.
"
"
This is definitely one of the best toothbrushes you can find for such a low selling price.Although it does not have as many options and features as more expensive sonicare toothbrushes, it stands right out on top in cleaning capabilities when it's results are compared to the more expensive versions.The design and build quality of this sonicare is excellent.  It's waterproof,  the battery lasts long and it's ultra powerful at cleaning.  I definitely prefer the sonicare to all other brands, I find it much more powerful and the results blow the competition away.  To be able to get a sonicare for such a low price is an amazing deal.
"
"
A bit of a learning curve for me as my previous toothbrush is rotary, and this one ""just"" vibrates at high frequency.  This does require me to brush rather than just move it around, but the end result seems to be about the same, and better on my back molars.  I really appreciate the simplicity and ease of use with this one - push the button and brush until the timer stops.  There is no bluetooth function or supporting app, or variety of settings - turn it on and it cleans your teeth.  Another advantage of the non-rotary head is its slim size, which means I can easily clean my wisdom teeth with no discomfort.
"
"
As far as electric toothbrushes go, this one is a good value for the price. The timer works well, but I found that the unit needs to be charged a lot more often than my other electric toothbrush. This battery doesn't seem as strong, so I just ensure to charge it up daily. Still, for the price, it's a good bargain for the benefits of using an electric toothbrush.I like that all Philips Sonicare brush heads will fit on this unit.
"
"
For the price, I think this is a very nice tooth brush. It is a rechargeable toothbrush that will last two weeks between charges, and it is comfortable to use. The rubber handle is a lot nicer than the hard plastic cases found on cheaper brushes. While this doesn't have many fancy modes or Bluetooth, it does a good job of brushing your teeth and breaking up any plaque on your teeth.
"
"
This is an adult size toothbrush, but my children think it’s great fun! Makes quick & thorough work of a daily task.The battery life is great, lasts a good while. Which is nice so we don’t always have the clutter of the cord around our small bathroom. The indicator lights make it easy to know when to charge so we aren’t stuck with partially done teeth when it quits.
"
"
This is a great electric toothbrush especially given how inexpensive it is.  I have tried a number of sonicare toothbrush, this one is definitely the lowest price but it's still a good product.If you are new to electric toothbrush and aren't sure if you'll like it, this is a great one to try out.
"
"
I giving my review after using this toothbrush fir more than 2 months.Ordered it on my dentist advice.  He gave  me couple of options and this one was perfect for me and priced reasonably.I feel the difference after using this Phillips sonic toothbrush. My mouth feels more clean.I wish if Phillips had given an additional brush attachment along with it. Charging is quick.
"
"
I've only used Oral B's in the past but this was on sale so decided to give it a try. The difference is amazing! The motor hums along nicely and my teeth feel smoother and cleaner than ever before. I bought this one for my partner and she loves it too.
"
"
I've had this for 6 months now, and my dentist has noticed the difference! My teeth were way cleaner than usual, even the back teeth were plaque free! I find I get a week between charges. And I changed the brush head after 3 months - using the Vinfany brush heads. I should have bought one of these years ago.
"
"
Is it the fanciest? Nope.Is it the cheapest that still has that sonicare tech and you can use the same brush heads as their over $100 ones? Yes.Nuff said. This is the best bang for the buck and all other additional features are superficial and money grabs.
"
"
First electric tooth brush. So far it's working well for me as I learn how to use it. Does leave teeth feeling cleaner than normal brush. Seems very durable and good quality. It is very loud to use though and sometimes I feel like I 'm waking up other people in the house using it.
"
"
I am really loving this toothbrush.Compare to my previous oral-b, this is:cleaning better10x more silent (the basic mechanical oscillation of oral-b vs the micro vibration of sonicare is a huge tech gap..)better constructionbigger surface of the bush
"
"
For about $30.00 this is a basic electric toothbrush. But it does the job. No bells or whistles. Comes with a charger and 1 brush.
"

Great product.

I have been using sonic toothbrushes for a while and it does take some getting used to.  Once used to the vibrations on gum and teeth, the brushing experience is good and effective.  This unit is has the basic functions and truly that is probably all that is needed.  The instructions provide information as to how to change the intensity.  I tried them and did not notice any difference but I am used to using these so perhaps I am no longer sensitive enough to the sonic vibrations to notice.The toothbrush sits upright on a charger that doubles as a stand.  The charger has a very small footprint all enclosed in plastic that is easy to clean.When the brush is placed on the charger there is a beep.  Charging light (green) is difficult to see in the light.I do like the added features of higher end models but this one does what it is intended to do and that is to clean your teeth and gums effectively.
"
"
As far as electric toothbrushes go this one is pretty good  for the value for the price. It does not have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive ones. But it is a good one to start or for your older children to get into electric toothbrushes.I found that the unit needs to be charged a lot more often than the other electric toothbrush that we have. not sure if its just this toothbrush or all of them. My oldest daughter does love it she likes having an electric toothbrush and it does work well for her. Over all it is a decent toothbrush to get into the electric realm. and for the price its one that could go in your travel kit if you are worried about taking your more expensive toothbrush if you are worried about loosing it.

I’ve concluded that Philips is the clear leader in exceptional consumer health products. Oral B was my go to brand for a while because that’s what everyone uses and the replacement heads are easy to find, but I noticed after some time that my teeth were getting very sensitive and especially so when I used a Oral B electric toothbrush on consecutive days. So since I’ve switched to this Philips brush, I use light and quick movements over my teeth while the vibrations are active, and the results are startling! It cleanses just as well and perhaps even better than the Oral B, and I have no aching teeth whatsoever.With a nice elegant design, easy maneuverability, and great battery life, I can’t help but say consider a Philips brush first before getting Oral B and you will not be disappointed. Plus you won’t have receding gums for properly using an electric toothbrush, I never had issues with applying too much pressure but that rotating motion on Oral B brushes does seem excessive for something we do at least twice a day...
"

I've had the opportunity to use a wide range of Phillips and Braun branded electric tooth brushes, including the top end models from both brands. I've found that in my experience, the low-mid end models honestly provide the best bang for buck, and this particular model definitely fits that bill! It gives you 90% of the experience at like 40% of the price. I found the motor on this to be adequately powerful to get my teeth feeling nice and clean - I really like the ""sonic"" oscillations of the philips line over the rotating brush head of the brauns. You miss out on the fancy cup charger and travel case of higher end models, but I really find that they aren't worth the price premium. Some might argue that the additional brush modes make a difference, but I found they don't offer any meaningful differences for me - it vibrates, that's all I need it to do. Oscillating at different frequencies, I really don't think is going to change how clean your teeth are.So what do you get at this price? You get a very cheap ticket into the philips sonicare line up, since the brush heads are compatible accross all their units - from high to low end. So I'd recommend you buy into this nice low-mid end model, and save the money for extra brushehads.
"
"
This is a good quick electric toothbrush - I've been using this one up at camp (I don't want to bring my high end one there!) and it's the perfect refresher twice a day.It doesn't have quite the same power as my normal brush, so it's great for someone converting over from a manual to electric toothbrush.There's only one brush head that comes with it, but since The replacement heads aren't too ricey for a multi pack, so it's a good overall economical fit.It's comfortable enough to hold, and my teeth feel clean after use.It charges on a little base that plugs into the wall socket, and has no bells & whistles.It's good value for what you get, and your teeth will thank you.
"
"
First time I used this tooth brush I bruised my gum because the tip of the bristle was very sharp and sticking out.To fix that problem I had to cut the tip off using a scissors, it could have been just that one brush head that was not made properly I do not know because I only got one brush head with this toothbrush.On this model the brush head is at about a 5 Degree angled into the left of the brush body, this I find has no benefit and is not found on the higher end models.I am not impressed with this toothbrush after having used the higher end Sonicare toothbrush. I guess if you are looking for something inexpensive that will do a decent job then this toothbrush might be the one.
"
"
My wife and I already use varying models of  Sonicare toothbrushes.  We prefer them over the rotating kind as I think the shape of the head for Sonicare just is easier to use and ensure everything is nice and clean.My daughter is using this unit and one of the best features for her is the timer.  It just ensures that she's cleaning properly.  She has mentioned that it feels like it's ""too long"" and might use a manual toothbrush in the morning and the electric at night.I'm sure there are a million reviews on these devices, and I'm sure most of them are positive.  What I usually go buy and why I was interested in the first place, was that these are recommended by our dentist.
"
"
This toothbrush’s most spectacular feature is its head shape, it has rectangular shaped head that cleans in hard to reach areas and removes plaque and buildup. It has a low battery light indicator and a two minutes timer. It’s battery chamber is nicely designed and sealed to reduce water buildup and leakage. This is something I noticed in most of electric toothbrushes but this is nice designed and so far I did not notice any of this.Overall very nice electric toothbrush that cleans in hard to reach areas and reduces buildup and plaques.
"
"
There is a lot to like about this electric toothbrush but sadly it is no better or worse than others on the market. First of all, Dentist recommend a round brush head - this does not have it. The sonic vibration used to ""clean teeth"" also doesn't feel great on the gums. The battery life is great though and it is largely inexpensive. As to its claims of ""Removes up to 3X more plaque than a manual toothbrush"", I can't verify but I think most toothbrushes of this nature do the same?
"
"
If you want sonicare without paying the premium for the best ones on the market, this is definitely a decent option. The toothbrush oscilates/pulses, just like most other sonicares. It's definitely not a high end toothbrush, BUT it does a good job and if you are debating whether to spend $200 down the road on the top end one but have never tried an electric toothbrush before, this is an awesome starting point to see if you'll like it!
"
"
I have tested several makes and models of electric toothbrushes over the last few years. This is a great entry point model. For those looking to take an electric toothbrush for a spin without paying huge bucks. It is very functional, easy to use. And works well. Just does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the much more expensive models. A really great option to test and see if you can make the switch from manual.
"
"
Most electric toothbrushes are quite expensive, this Philips Sonicare Dailyclean Electric Rechargeable toothbrush is affordable, which is a good thing. You also do not need a smartphone to set it up!! It works well to brush your tooth, should use it for about 2 minutes. Battery life is OK too, one charge lasts about a week for me, but this may change with the frequency you actually use it. Good deal over all.
"
"
This toothbrush is the best thing for your teeth since the old spin brush this is so much more gentle on the teeth and vibrates to clean deep between the teeth not just the surface. You can get cheap heads on Amazon for it so you don't have to pay $20 a pop and it is kid size and an amazing price! Fantastic model for parents who want to give their kids a sonic brush but don't want to spend hundreds!
"
"
This is a basic toothbrush that lacks all of the creature comforts that I am now used to in my $200+ toothbrushes... but it does everything you need to keep your teeth and gums clean without breaking the bank. It's comfortable to hold and got my teeth clean.In terms of actual cleaning, I really don't feel like there's a difference.
"
"
Good value for the money, the Philips Sonicare Dailyclean Electric Rechargeable toothbrush, Hx3211/62, Dark Blue W/Simply Clean Brush Head, is comfortable, charges quickly and lasts a long time. The brush vibrates so it is comfortable to use, as well as to hold.  Overall, good brush.

I don't have the best history with electric toothbrushes, they all tend to stop working very early into use. Here's some background information for why I have bad experience with toothbrushes and why I gave this product 5/5. Bought quite a few electric toothbrushes, after a month I noticed that it starts to lose power, sure it can be the battery, but I changed it multiple times and it does not provide the same strength as they did when new, some of them just stopped working, press the button hear a quiet buzz but no action. So I decided to try this product out and if it hadn't worked as it did I would have gone to manual brushes since they can't break mechanically. Didn't buy this with high hope since reviews on the previous ones were also very good and they didn't live up to the expectation I had. So a month in and it was still working as new, I was blown away. Now it's been a year and the only thing i've had to replace is the brush head. I am extremely glad I came across this before another brush which would have undoubtedly deterred me from purchasing anymore electric brushes. So I would recommend this brush for those who have had the same issues with other brushes as this one does seem to be a good durable product.
"
"
At first, I wasn't a believer in electronic toothbrushes. I thought they were just a gimmick (an expensive one at that), and that a manual toothbrush is just as good as an electric one. But after my package arrived (Arrived only after 2 days) and I tried it out I fell in love with this product. This product comes with an extra head, as well as a recharge pad (place the toothbrush on it, and it recharges), which was a pleasant surprise from the expected AA batteries. At first, the toothbrush felt rough against my teeth, and my gums bled a bit. But after regularly using this device, it no longer feels rough against my teeth, and my teeth truly feel clean after using it.10/10, Best purchase of my life.
"
"
I have had an earlier model of this for 4 years now and still going strong so I wanted to get one for my wife. They also have this model variant which is perfect for kids.Pros:- rechargeable, and this new one has a smaller charging base which is good for small counters- timer goes off at 2 minutes by turning the unit off and on in quick little buzzes which is perfect (my daughter gets it and it works well to help her get into good brushing habits)- lots of compatible brush headsCons:- brush head replacements (at least the official manufacturer ones) are quite expensive- no intermittent timer to tell you when you've done 30 seconds in a zone of teethOverall this brush is good value, at only $30 you get a good rechargeable toothbrush. I don't know why you would spend more on a brush that has bluetooth or other fancy things when this one works perfectly. It's also perfect for kids, I'd rather spend this and get this nicer brush than get the cheap $10 brushes that last only a few weeks.
"
"
A very reasonably priced toothbrush that provides a thorough, refreshing clean. The 2-minute timer is great with letting you know if you've brushed for long enough. I switched to an electric toothbrush because my gums were receding (the dentist told me I was brushing too hard with a manual brush) and this new brush has minimised, if not eliminated, the problem. It's definitely a good value brush for the price, which was my main concern when looking for an electric toothbrush. The battery lasts for a few days, so you don't need to worry about having it plugged in constantly, but the plug also provides a good base/stand for the brush, so you can leave it plugged in all the time without hassle. I thoroughly recommend to anyone who needs a good electric toothbrush on a budget!
"
"
This is a decent electric toothbrush for a decent price but if you have sensitive gums you might want to buy another type of head for it...I love the brush and the price but the head that comes with it is very aggressive...it's like brushing your teeth with a mini grinder..lol  I still have my sonic toothbrush (which I prefer) but I can't find replacement heads for it anywhere which is why I bought this one. Generic heads are very cheap for this which is another plus so basically be careful buying electric toothbrush brands that aren't common in North America as the heads can be hard to find.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist. I decided to grab the cheapest, best reviewed one off amazon and WOW!First time users, make sure you dont turn it on before its in your mouth like I did (my toothpaste ended up on my bathrobe). Behold, the sheer power of the brush! The little rubber ""flossers"" really gave my gums quite the deep tissue massage. I was a bit skeptical by how intense this ""brushing"" felt, but at the end of the two minutes (it really does tell you when the time is up by a pulsing vibe!) I rinsed my mouth and WOW. Mouth never felt so clean.Great value for the price. Just bought one for my husband too!
"
"
I'm pretty disappointed with these. I guess I shouldn't expect too much for the price, but they get super slimy and gross under where the brush head is attached. I have to remove the brush head and clean it underneath everytime I use it so it doesn't build up and get stinky and slimy. I've actually stopped using mine altogether because it's not worth it. The actual cleaning capability isn't terrible but I don't love it either. I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting a higher quality electric toothbrush. Ideally go with Sonicare they're a lot better.
"
"
Solid electric toothbrush at a reasonable price, especially on sale when its priced around $20. There are other more expensive options available by Oral-B and other brands which don't justify the price, but these do a really good job of cleaning your teeth as is the purpose of all brushes, so it is a sensible buy for anyone. Been using it for around 2 years now and its still working perfectly fine without any issues.
"
"
I've never owned an electronic brush, decided to try a lower budget one because who wants to spend $150+ on a tooth brush. I've owned this for a few months now, it works great. 2 minute timer that vibrates off and on near the end and it comes with a replacement brush.Be on the lookout for them in Superstore as I've seen them as low as $21. Otherwise it's definitely worth the price on Amazon.
"
"
I purchased this item from Amazon in 2015. I still have the exact same brush, and I have no issues with battery life.Comes with a nifty little stand that charges the brush, and I can use third party brush heads (no name brand) as well. The brush is also easy to clean and my dentist has noted the improvement in the health of my teeth.I would highly recommend this brush.The ONLY downside I have experienced is that if you are buying those neat little brush cases (that cover the head), they usually do not fit because the head attachment is too thick to fit them.Otherwise, well worth the buy. Here's to another 3 years!

I have to remove the brush head and clean it underneath everytime I use it so it doesn't build up and get stinky and slimy. I've actually stopped using mine altogether because it's not worth it. The actual cleaning capability isn't terrible but I don't love it either. I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting a higher quality electric toothbrush. Ideally go with Sonicare they're a lot better.

Solid electric toothbrush at a reasonable price, especially on sale when its priced around $20. There are other more expensive options available by Oral-B and other brands which don't justify the price, but these do a really good job of cleaning your teeth as is the purpose of all brushes, so it is a sensible buy for anyone. Been using it for around 2 years now and its still working perfectly fine without any issues.

I've never owned an electronic brush, decided to try a lower budget one because who wants to spend $150+ on a tooth brush. I've owned this for a few months now, it works great. 2 minute timer that vibrates off and on near the end and it comes with a replacement brush.Be on the lookout for them in Superstore as I've seen them as low as $21. Otherwise it's definitely worth the price on Amazon.

I purchased this item from Amazon in 2015. I still have the exact same brush, and I have no issues with battery life.Comes with a nifty little stand that charges the brush, and I can use third party brush heads (no name brand) as well. The brush is also easy to clean and my dentist has noted the improvement in the health of my teeth.I would highly recommend this brush.The ONLY downside I have experienced is that if you are buying those neat little brush cases (that cover the head), they usually do not fit because the head attachment is too thick to fit them.Otherwise, well worth the buy. Here's to another 3 years!
"
"
I have a sonicare, but wanted to try a Braun as some family members preferred it.  It does do a decent cleaning job, but I found the brush heads of the sonicare were softer (even though I purchased soft Braun brush heads).  Also, I really dislike that the Braun head has 2 holes that can hold residual fluid from brushing your teeth, and even rinsing with water doesn’t get rid of all of it.  And so when returning your brush to the charger, the fluid sleeps down and makes a ring at the base that always needs cleaning.  The sonicare doesn’t do this.  It’s annoying and that’s why this brush only gets a 4 star.

I had an oral B electronic toothbrush for many years and it finally kicked the bucket. After several weeks of brushing my teeth up and down and round and round with a good old fashioned brush, I decided to splurge and buy myself another oral B electronic toothbrush. I’m pretty sure this thing crossed paths with an F15 eagle aircraft en route to my house, because the speed is unlike anything I’ve ever been privy to in my life. I didn’t even last the two minute timer and my spit was bright pink and full of blood. It’s like my gums went to the mall and sat in a massage chair on speed. I recommend this brush if you never want to visit the dentist again. I’m pretty sure it’ll remove plaque, fight cavities, and put any crooked teeth back in place in under two minutes!
"
"
Worked well for 3 years, but the battery life was pretty poor by the time I decided to upgrade.This is a good introduction to electric toothbrushes without having to shell out a lot of money for something that may not be for you. Oral B also used the same heads for all its brushes, so when you decide to switch you wont have to stock up again.Pro tip: you can get large packs of brush heads on Amazon for a much cheaper price than in store :) around 2-3$ a head vs. 10$
"
"
If I could rate it at zero I would.  Within a month the toothbrush would turn on on it's own with no way of turning it off.  It is now unusable and in the garbage.  The sad thing is, I researched the brand and this was highly recommended.  I realize there are defective products but this one takes the cake.  I have had other electric toothbrushes that lasted a long time even though they only costed a few dollars.  I will not take a chance again on this brand. Very disappointed!
"
"
Considering the price point this is good value. It is a replacement for the last generation model. It has an improved battery. One suggestion. Do not store it in the charger. I did that with the old one and it killed the battery over time. I opted to buy new rather than change the battery because the old one was 5 years old and although it seemed mechanically OK I thought its time was limited and it had served me well.
"
"
Je viens de recevoir la brosse à dent et c est le modèle standard de wall mart , mauvaise représentation photo ! Ce n est pas leModèle en photo ! Mais le bleu ciel a l ancienne très déçu
"
"
Anyone who hasn't owned an electric toothbrush are missing out! This is so convenient and it really improved my oral hygiene. Just leave it charging in the washroom to be used anytime. I feel like I'm also saving on waste from only buying the brush tips instead of buying new toothbrushes all the time.
"
"
This is a fantastic electric brush for the price. It’s not noisy. It is as “loud” as you’d expect an electric toothbrush to be. The floss action actually does work. I do notice a difference when I floss afterwards, compared to using another brush brush. My teeth feel squeaky clean and happy! I don’t need to use any pressure at all with this brush. The timer function is cool too: at 2 minutes there are 4(?) short vibrations as a signal. Charging is convenient.
"
"
Just got it in the mail. Worked for a couple days but then wouldn't hold a charge. I did all the troubleshooting required (made sure outlet was working, charged for 22 hours etc...) but still wouldn't work. Then I was dumb and opened up the toothbrush because I thought I could replace the battery. I just voided the warranty instead...
"
"
Ordered two of these,items. One dles nor hold charge sending it back. Other so far okay. As for brushes. Really like them. Had Phillips sonic care prior to these, the oral b does much benter job. Would have given a 5 if both had worked properly. Will follow up re other one.
"
"
I used to use the regular toothbrushes, not really trust the electric toothbrush until I saw this deal.After trying it, I think it really provides a thorough, refreshing clean and my teeth truly feel better than before. It also comes with an extra head, which probably lasts 2 more months? The recharge pad and rechargeable battery also save me some money I believe.
"
"
I really like this battery operated tooth brush.  I never used one before because I was not really into so much electric tooth brushes. But one day I just thought why not just give it a try , now I think why I never used one before.  I really like the two minutes auto signal and the battery is so powerful, never runs out . You just need to put it on charge once for 8 hours in four to five days.This makes my morning and night brushing easy and fun. I really recommend this brand. If You people out there still thinking  to buy it don't think just buy it. You won't regret it.
"
"
I love it. I have lost my 5 years old oralB on Wednesday 39th of August 2018. I ordered this one on Thursday 30th August 2018 before midnight and I received it on 31 August 2018 at 3:00 pm. Can you hope any faster than this ???!!!I am amazed by the Prime privileges.I will keep Prime for sure.Thank you
"
"
This toothbrush does the job; it's very powerful but is still gentle on the gums.  Gets rid of those coffee stains - lol.  I've gifted this electric toothbrush to my daughter, my husband, my son and (of course!) to myself - hahaha.  Everybody loves this Oral B Vitality Toothbrush.
"
"
My dentists suggested I get a Oral B toothbrush back in the 90's I have been using one ever since. The last Oral B I had lasted for 8 years. It still charged but the bruising was not the same as when its new. I love this tooth brush, If you are thinking of buying one just buy it.
"
"
I definitely do not recommend this. There are no speeds and it’s so hard and fast that it feels like it’s going to rip your teeth out. Worst electric toothbrush I’ve ever owned. You get what you pay for - avoid this one.
"
"
I used it about 6 times altogether!  I noticed from the start that it seemed to be running slow.  On the 7th time I tried to use it, it stopped altogether.  I had it plugged in the entire time.  I guess you only get what you paid for.  But in this case, I got NOTHING.
"
"
We bought them for our kids.  We were getting sick of the batteries with the children's electric toothbrushes.  However, the charge life is not that great and the tooth brush does not stop after 2 minutes, which gets confusing for the kids.
"
"
Performs much better than my previous Arm & Hammer Spinbrush.  I like the timer feature that pulses when you have hit the two minute mark for brushing.  The charge lasts at least 6 days for me, brushing twice a day.  I like the fact that when the battery does run out, it is still at full brushing power; it doesn't slowly get less and less powerful as the battery drains.  Very happy.  Official brush heads for this product are a bit pricy.
"
"
Cela faisait longtemps que je voulais une brosse à dent électrique. Je pensais que c'était cher. En fait, oui il y en a des dispendieuse, mais celle-ci est abordable et fait très bien le travail. Je ne passerai jamais plus d'une brosse à dents électrique, surtout à ce prix.
"
"
I absolutely love this electric toothbrush!!It is very powerful and it cleans my teeth so well I get compliments from my dentist that my teeth and gums look great!!Its also very easy to find replacement heads for this brand and model.You cant beat the price as well.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush at a good price. My dentist recommended this brand. Has a timer when you're done (2 mins) and charge stays about five days without charger (but I usually leave it plugged in consistently when I am home). Overall happy with purchase!
"
"
Overall good product. The brush heads it cameWith are a little too strong for my teeth, and the power should be lowered just a little as any moment I take it out of my Mouth it splashed everywhere. The timer button is also very hard to press and only works a handful of times. Might try with other brush heads and see if the strength is tolerable.
"
"
First time I have electric toothbrush, so it's hard for me to compare to other product on the market.  But I really like it, it seems to be sturdy.  I'm always a bit scared on how long the battery will last.  But I didn't noticed too many bad comment on that.
"
"
I've had a couple of these now.  They have lasted a long time, and work well.  My gums were receding from brushing too hard with a manual toothbrush.  They have not gotten any worse since I started using one of these.  My only complaint is that the handle and base can be hard to clean.  I rinse the handle thoroughly each time I use it, but the rubber part still gets stained.
"
"
Conforme a la description !!  Brosse  dent de qualité, minuteur intégré pour nous signifier que nous avons brosser nos dent! elle,rend les dent bien propre! Merci
"
"
The main reason why i am giving it such a low rating is because it just stop working after 3 weeks. There is no indicator if the product is charging or needs to be charged. The brush it self is a little smaller the a thought but that was no issue. Also it does come with a built in 2 mintue timer , so you know when to stop , that was a plus.  Very simple product ,easy to use.
"
"
This is really inexpensive and effective for what it costs. I like the two minute timer feature that makes sure I brush my teeth for at least two minutes, because I'm bad at timing myself. The battery tends to last me about a week, so it doesn't require constant charging (and you can usually tell when it needs a charge because of the speed it is brushing at)
"
"
Well this is the first electric toothbrush I've ever used in my life. It takes some time to get used to it that's for sure. After I did I found it does a good job. Teeth feel cleaner after using it. Am glad my dentist recommended it to me.
"
"
Marche a merveille ! dure en moyenne 3 ans avant que la batterie lâche ou la partie du chargeur, mais sachez que cela n'est pas une raison de ne pas l'acheter !
"
"
I don't utilize the  timer function, so no comment there. I utilize the tooth brush aprox 3 minutes at atime so have seen no degradation in battery,...but do not run it long enough to feel comfortable commenting on battery life.In comparison to brick and mortar stores I found the Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush to be of great value.
"
"
In 2017 I bought a replacement Oral B toothbrush for $18.00 that was identical to my old broken one. When I needed to replace another one I bought this Oral B Vitality model for $25. It kind of sucks compared to the original. It feels lighter and cheaper and it runs at a lower  (single) speed. It also lacks a charging LED.If I had thought of it in time I would have returned it.
"
"
The is the second of these toothbrushes that I've had. The first lasted 11 years, although the battery began to die after about 8 years. For a while I could still get a good charge by running it down completely before recharging. I would have replaced it sooner if I'd known they were this inexpensive!
"
"
I've been using the Oral-B electric toothbrush for a month now and it seems to do a great job. I know I brush for a full 2 min now because it has a timer. I leave it in the charging stand so it's always fully charged.
"
"
This brush is ok. You definitely need to learn to hold it with 2 fingers and the gentleness of a baby. It is a hardcore vibration device. It gets my teeth clean although I'm a bit concerned about long-term enamel damage. This isn't a slanted review, this device is seriously powerful. You could chip your teeth if your not careful.
"
"
C'est mon deuxième achat de ce type de brosse à dent et toujours très satisfait !Petit bémol : la photo sur Amazon diffère de l'objet reçu.  Sur la photo il y du bleu et la brosse reçu est totalement blanche.
"
"
very good thootbrush. batery last a long time and fast to charge. the brissels on the head cleans really well between teeths. i recommend this to anyone who is looking for an electric toothbrush. very cost effective.
"
"
I have used these products for years excellent productJust back from dentist, very impressed with clean teeth, I have 32 excellent teeth!!NOTE: I am 76 years old
"
"
Replacement unit for my parents.  My unit is too powerful for their teeth.  So far after several days, they enjoy using it.  The life cycle is improving which is a plus.
"
"
The best toothbrush I can invest in not to pricey and it does the job. My mouth feel so clean like I go to the dentist every day. It is easy to use and control. I love it.
"
"
I bought this brush to replace an older version of a Vitality and this one is way better.  It keeps the charge several days and has a nice strong spin.  I'm never going back to manual brushing.
"
"
I love my new brush and the 2 minute timer really helps to focus on the job at hand.No complaints - it was well worth every penny but it was on sale so it intrigued me.
"
"
Stopped buying the toothbrushes that take replaceable batteries and start to slow down after a week. This is convenient and different heads are simple to order
"
"
Have been using this for over 2 months now & I must say I am more than satisfied with this toothbrush.Charging works as intended .Timer helps me make sure I brush full cycle.Good for the price as they also bundle an extra head with it.Would have been great if they could bundle a travel case but maybe I am just being greedy.
"
"
After just over one month of using this toothbrush it stopped working properly. At full battery charge it would not turn on immediately, however after waiting 10-20 seconds after pushing the button it would start working. This lasted a few days after which it simply would no longer turn on. I was replacing an older version of this toothbrush model which worked flawlessly for years, and was disappointed by this model.
"
"
Everything is fine about this toothbrush except fluid drips down your arm while you're brushing!!!!! It may not seem like that big of a deal but when you're brushing your teeth 2+ times a day, it's extremely infuriating.I switched to the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and it's much better.
"
"
I am really pleased with this product. It works very well and it’s slim design takes up virtually no space on our counter. I took it out of town for three days without the charger, and it never lost its power. I definitely recommend and would buy again.
"
"
Dentist recommended. Was told this was as good as more expensive models. Have received great results. Much better than manual brushing.
"
"
This one supposed to be for me. But my toddler son liked it too. We end up sharing ( with different / separate head of course ). Will be buying more replacement head or buy one for my son so i dont have to change the head everytime we use :)
"
"
it is working good so far.it runs a lot longer on a charge than the oral b electric toothbrushes that I have used for several years,but that is probably normal for a toothbrush that has been recharged many times over the years.i have had very good success with oral b electric toothbrushes over the years,so I trust this one will be the same.
"
"
Love this brush so far!  I can't imagine any bad reviews on this one.  Not powerful brush head, just right.  Nice to handle.  All around, really nice;))
"
"
Oral-B have wonderful product, but no info about the timer on the owners little book, and did not seems to works since i brush my toot more that 3 minutes with it. Overall, great product, very satisfied.
"
"
Toothbrush works great. No complaints. But you are to replace the brush every three months. You can buy a new toothbrush for the cost of the replacement heads. I would not recomment this toothbrush. There are brushes out there that are just as good but have affordable replacement brushes.
"
"
Cleans very well and works like a charm. Highly recommended. No need to spend on much more expensive brush, this one works pretty well.
"
"
This is my 3rd Oral B electric toothbrush--I replace the unit every 3  years, so that means I've been using them for quite a few years. During this time all I have to do is occasionally replace the heads. Batteries do eventually run out--but that takes several years. My teeth are great--and my husband has spent far more on traditional toothbrushes over these years.
"
"
Bought 2. Great toothbrush, teeth feel really clean. Battery holds charge for few days, only problem is you can feel the strength of the battery depleting, the best brush is when it's freshly charged and then after a bit it gets weaker. Wish it held consistent power and then just died rather than getting weaker. Not a big issue, just going to charge it more frequently but the clean feel is miles away from a manual brush, definitely worth the switch
"
"
Absolute garbage.  Do not buy.  I have had 3 oral B electric toothbrushes in the past and this is the first one I have had problems with, it just hums when I press the on button and has absolutely no battery power even when I do eventually manage to occasionally get it to work.  Garbage product.
"
"
This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used. It feels like rubbing your teeth with a grinder. I find it hard to believe it’s oral B. Don’t waste your money.
"
"
It was a good broke after the 35 time using I only had too charge it once but as soon as I go too take the head of it off and on the toothbrush never turned back on now I'm stuck with an extra large regular toothbrush lol. Otherwise worked great
"
"
Brought this for my son. I have one myself and love it.  I find it works great and my teeth feel so clean.  Love this item and I know my son will too!
"
"
I love my toothbrush now but at the beginning it was too hard on my gums. The timer unsure it’s function haven’t read up too much on it.
"
"
I love it. It feels cleaner now that i am using it. The brush is soft and the rubber part of it really helps massage my gum. My gum bleeding has stoooed since. Didn't charge yet after a month using it.
"
"
The brush just stopped charging in 4 months...tried different plug points but does not work and is outside the return window so money gone.
"
"
I like the toothbrush at first it would only last like 1 minute but I realized it wasn't fully charged lol!but yea overall great toothbrush & the thing about Oral B is that you can order any toothbrush head for your brush which is great too...so for all the people who find that this brush head is too rough on their teeth/gums you can buy separate ""oral b sensitive replacement heads""
"
"
Having never used an electric toothbrush before, I was truly amazed with the difference in the results.  My husband also bought one  and he  is also pleased with his. It really gets the job done and the price is great. Will purchase again
"
"
Great little tooth brush at a great price. Teeth feel real ckean after use and the head can get in between your teeth so you can miss flossing now and then.
"
"
Handle perpetually stinks.  I wash my hands before use, wash the handle after use and it still stinks.  I replaced a battery powered Oral-B with this and I'm glad I kept it because this thing is going in the garbage.  What a waste of money.
"
"
I ordered this product for my girlfriend and she likes it very much. She says, it cleans her teeth better than any other toothbrush she's had. Highly recommend!
"
"
It’s only three months old and it’s not holding its charge for more than a day ,  I should say this has not been my experience with past purchases of the same product.  Would appreciate a replacement!
"
"
Arrived after only one weekWorks great. Oral-B have great products. The first Oral-B i bought 13 years ago still works fine. Only needs to change brushes.My wife wanted this new one becauise she do not want to switch brush every morning and evening.
"
"
Really like it, wished the battery was a little longer lasting. But for the price couldn’t beat it!
"
"
A little disappointed.  I had an electric tooth brush before but it was another Braun model and it had two speeds.  Miss this on the brush I purchased and end up with tooth past all over the walls and sink.
"
"
Very strong brushing action with a rectangular head. I have generic round replacement heads that work as well.
"
"
Great toothbrush. This replaced a Vitality I've been using for 5+ years which gave up on charging - both battery life and finally the charger. Hope this one lasts as long as the previous one.
"
"
This toothbrush Is boss. Received it recently, charged for 16 hours as per instructions. It’s super strong and wow what a good price. I can compare it to a $200 spin brush.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
"
"
I waited 2 months for the review. Still works great. One charge can last 4-5 days. Had good results per dental hygienist. Noticeably less tartar. You still have to floss though.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that it's amazing. You get the post dentist cleaning feeling every time.The two minute timer is really convenient, the battery lasts for quite a while and it's very easy to clean.
"
"
Had a great checkup, and both my hygienist and dentist remarked on the difference it. Add to my teeth and gums.  Love the clean feeling!
"
"
Beats your regular toothbrush, hands down! Now my teeth always feel squeaky clean. So easy to clean and I love how it has a built-in timer mechanism. When fully charged it lasts a week of twice daily brushing.
"
"
Much better than expected, in fact, if you had already purchased an expensive electric one and got this one for travelling.. Then you might feel slim to none difference.. Except that.. I shouldn't have paid that much for the one at home..
"
"
Pretty good and good price. The only thing it's I got so exited for nothing when I saw the 10$ coupon but they send you a expire coupon.
"
"
The toothbrush is good but I wanted to buy another one for a family member and now apparently its only for prime members which is sort of dumb as I can't afford the monthly rate of prime for a toothbrush.
"
"
The Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush is as advertised. Lots of power, holds a charge well and does a bloody great job. Teeth feel great.The item was delivered quickly and is excellent value for the price..
"
"
Bought for the wife and I.  Our first venture into an electric brush.The reviews are true.  Teeth are much cleaner.  Very happy with the purchase.
"
"
My newly bought electric toothbrush only lasts 6 cycles. It seems too short. I had another Oral-B Vitality from a year ago and that one lasts at least 14 cycles. Not sure if I got one with poor battery or if the battery capacity has been decreased.
"
"
excellent. my wife and i been using  ours past 6 or 7 months. still work  like new.  the brush head was not very good. soon after  few months some of the fibers were coming off.
"
"
My original rechargeable Braun gave out after 20 years of use. Loved it. This is a great replacement. Teeth feel clean after brushing!
"
"
I gifted my husband and my nephew for Christmas. They are happy with the toothbrushes rechargeable.
"
"
C'est quoi la la joke ?une brosse à dents c'est pour se brosser les dents 🤣
"
"
Loving it!Wish it came with a travel case is all.Ordered one more for my kiddo.
"
"
Good for the price. although it does not have a light to tell you the battery level or anything like that instead it just get less and less powerful until it dies. Definitely worth it for the price though
"
"
Love this toothbrush. It’s my second one! I’d recommend it for sure. Holds a good charge and easy to change the brush. Love it! Thanks : )
"
"
Does what it says on the tin. It’s an electric toothbrush, it may not be the best version out there, but it’s still going to clean better than a regular toothbrush!
"
"
Just replaced with the same old model. Vibrates mouth a little, just as well i replace old one, cleans a lot better.
"
"
I got this to replace an old electric Brush by Oral-B and this one is lighter and is only one speed but it does an excellent job and I love it
"
"
Simple to use and excellent value. Holds charge well and functions perfectly.
"
"
Works as expected.  This was a very reasonably priced rechargeable toothbrush.  No bells and whistles, but who needs them on a toothbrush?
"
"
j'adore cette brosse et la possibilité de varier les  brossettes au gout.
"
"
Je suis très satisfait de la durabilité des deux appareils précédent du même type et de la même marque qui ont duré chacun 10 ans.Modèles de base qui font le travail pour lequel il sont conçu.Les brosses génériques(moins hi-tech) fonctionnent aussi très bien.
"
"
The dentist was disappointed to find all my teeth pain went away.  Plus I would rub on the sensitive toothpaste, after burshing, for a few minutes.  If you don't pull off the brush each time and rinse, a stinky film collects inside the piston.
"
"
This is my second one over the past few years.  Haven't needed to use it yet as old one is still working, just got it as a back up as my other one is a few years old and the on off switch is getting worn out.
"
"
my son wanted this just that it has to be charged alllthe time
"
"
My husband loved it ! great product. I have one for myself. Highly recommend.
"
"
Love this product, although it is a little rough on the teeth, you get a nice set of coupons and an extra toothbrush head with it too which is nice.
"
"
Found out that my old Braun 3D excel was no longer working because its associated charger was not charging. Old tooth brush is now working great with the charger received with the new one which is much more compact than the old one.
"
"
Not worth it. Was gift and it stopped working first week. Better to add $ and get better one
"
"
Pretty good. The battery life isn't too short, one charge lasts a couple of days. Only problem is, it doesn't give notice when battery is low. It will fall dead halfway while brushing my teeth.
"
"
Second one I have ordered.  Would highly recommend as it is great quailty.
"
"
rattles teeth initially but works great once you get used to it
"
"
Very nice toothbrush for the price. Spins as fast as the more expensive versions. Teeth feel very clean after use and gives a nice gum massage.
"
"
Keeps my teeth and gums fresh and stimulated! Love the timer thingy!
"
"
Works well, and timer useful. Would be even better if there were a charging indicator.
"
"
Great should have purchased this électrique toothbrush years ago
"
"
Toothbrush ceased to work after only 3 brushings.  This was a replacement toothbrush.  The first one also ceased to work after only several brushings.  May have something to do with the stutter notice indicating 2 minutes of brushing.  Will not be re-ordering.
"
"
Excellent rapport qualité prix. Brossage efficace.
"
"
Good one, actually very good for the price , better ones are available but very costly. This one does the job pretty well.
"
"
Good cheap electric toothbrush brush. Its cheap, it works. Bought this to replace the one I've had for a long time when I left it on a trip. Have and would purchase again.
"
"
Works great and does job, don't need to be $100+ tooth brush
"
"
The one I received is white so it’s different than the photo.. but I love it so much more! It looks great in the bathroom now and it works great as usual.
"
"
Livraison rapide. Facilité le brossage des dents
"
"
I love this product works great and lasts long, my previous one lasted 7 yrs! Highly recommend
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. It suits me well. It cleaned my teeth better than ever before.For its cheap price (comparing to other brands), highly recommend it to anyone who never tries the electric toothbrush.
"
"
I've only had this for a few days. The battery won't last long enough for it to brush for 2 minutes. It just dies half way.
"
"
Excellent product and will reorder when we need another one.
"
"
Oval happed rotary brush strikes teeth a lot.
"
"
My teeth don't feel any cleaner than with my a manual brush, in fact, quite the opposite. Also can't get used to the intense vibration in my teeth and head. Wish I could've returned it.
"
"
Great product! Still running and battery still holds the charge. I will buy this again.
"
"
Got it for my husband for Christmas and he likes it. Comes with two brush heads, replaceable and its rechargeable. No complaints from my husband. Great value.
"
"
Wish I knew about how amazing this electric toothbrush was sooner! Love that it has a timer. Excellent product! Loved it so much that my boyfriend also purchased one.
"
"
Been using for a couple months now and love it. Made me wonder why I never got an electric before! The timer function is super useful.
"
"
We purchased two Oral-B brushes about 5 years ago and use them daily. They still work as well as when first purchased. We purchased two more about a year ago but haven't used them because our original purchases are still excellent.
"
"
Works, timed the timer 1:30 approximately. Not enough time to do thorough job. Returning, waited 2 months, really disappointed.

I’ve used these brushes for a long time....they work awesome and my dentist loves the results
"
"
Same as my last one. But with better brush heads.
"
"
Love this electric toothbrush!  My teeth feels so clean and now my gums are faring better.
"
"
Really happy with this brush. Bought as a secondary for travel. My original is about 10 years old and still works perfect.
"
"
My kids each got one for Christmas and so far they work great! No issues, they also came with a spare brush head!!
"
"
Good value for the money wife likes it
"
"
brush head is hard at first, but after a couple uses it is fine. if you are extra sensitive, consider buying some interchangeable heads for sensitive gums/teeth first.
"
"
Love this! Should have got one years ago
"
"
Does well what it is supposed to do!Buy this if you just wanna clean your teeth and don’t wanna spend your money on fancy stuff.
"
"
I bought this for my wife, she never felt the need to use an electric brush. I just left it on her side of the sink she uses it everyday. It works well and it was a great price
"
"
Love this brush. All you need is a basic model and this is it!
"
"
Old model shipped. Not the same toothbrush shown. Coupons inside expired July 2018. Toothbrush is great but I don't appreciate seller getting rid of old stock on my dime .
"
"
I had this brand years ago, and for me Braun is number one product when it comes to washing teeth.
"
"
it does cleans better than a normal brush but I feel like I'm drilling my teeth and gums. after 1 week of use I'm getting use or the batteries are not that strong now.
"
"
Great product. Using it for many years and buying it again for replacement
"
"
Ma première brosse électrique. Je suis très satisfaite. Brossage de toute évidence plus efficace que la brosse traditionnelle.
"
"
Really good one but unhaopy because before the picture showed it was all white for adults and blue for kidsBut the one i received is not all white
"
"
Been using it for 6 months now and no issues. Cleans teeth well and a full charge lasts about a week if you brush twice a day. No complaints.
"
"
Got a lemon
"
"
Bonne qualité pour le prix.
"
"
Very nice cleaning job. Use it daily . Has made a difference.
"
"
My kids love these tooth brushes... they were suggested by the orthodontist and work great
"
"
The longer bristles on the outside of the head  did a great job cleaning down to the gums.
"
"
Fonctionne parfaitement !
"
"
Perfect! Don't know how I lasted so long without it. The charge last for days which is great for me.
"
"
I love this toothbrush! It is great for a first electric brush if you want to experiment and try it.
"
"
This replaces my old tooth brush, same make, If I wouldn't like it, I certainly would not have stayed with the same make.
"
"
Good product for the price
"
"
Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has been wanting an automatic toothbrush. He loves it! Brushes his teeth more often because he likes it so much. Great buy!
"
"
I like that you can do without charging battery for a few days
"
"
Decent toothbrush. Too ""rough"" or vigorous brushing for some people but I like it. Unfortunately the coupon that came with it was already expired (months before I purchased it).
"
"
Simple and does the work as expected. Pretty happy with the purchase. Haven't figured out the timer function yet but honestly not a big deal for me.
"
"
Good brand price good
"
"
2nd set of this type Oral B purchased we have purchased. Lasted 6+ years and cleans far better/easier than a manual brush. Best value I have found for electric tooth brush.
"
"
Inexpensive and works well
"
"
Purchased during a sale. My first electric brush and I like it a lot!
"
"
Love it. Best toothbrush I’ve had yet
"
"
Worked well for a few months then no longer held its charge
"
"
Great purchase and good product
"
"
Excellent product!
"
"
Très efficace elle aide à éliminer le tartre
"
"
Awesome toothbrush. Works great.
"
"
The vibrations are a bit to strong for me, but husband likes it so this goes to him. I ordered the sensitive version and likes it so far. One thing that could be better is if there is a indicator light for charging.
"
"
A favourite brand. Excellent product.
"
"
Recommended. Good quality. With one extra head.Update: I've been using it for a year now and I have no complain. Works perfectly.
"
"
I like the toothbrush. For the money seems like a good deal!
"
"
Oral B keeps the premium quality products at great price.
"
"
For the price it's an awesome electric toothbrush! My online complaint would be the vibration is a little aggressive but it doesn't bother me
"
"
Bought his as a gift for my husband. Unfortunately he only got 2 months of usage out of it before it stopped working. Don't waste your money.
"
"
Oral B products are always great
"
"
Great electric toothbrush
"
"
Works great. Would be better if there was a travel cover, it would prevent the bristles from becoming bent over.
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Acheté  pour mon fils cadeau
"
"
The brush provides a really rigorous and precise clean.  It comes with an automatic two-minute timer built in to help keep track of how long you have been brushing your teeth. It serves as a great motivator to keep brushing a few seconds longer, especially during groggy mornings.
"
"
Love it ! Plus it came right on time .
"
"
Facile d’utilisation avec les enfants, toute la famille aime.
"
"
Great idea, makes you brush longer and feels like it does make a difference.  Rechargeable and easy to charge/use.  Good Value!
"
"
Bonne achat
"
"
DO NOT buy if you don't wanna have to buy a whole new toothbrush two months later. Mine lasted about 8 weeks and it's completely dead. Won't charge or anything anymore
"
"
Good price
"
"
As good as more expensive models
"
"
Solid product for the money
"
"
Using this electric brush for 3 years. It is really amazing how it can clean your teeth.Bought this one as a gift for a friend.
"
"
I find the brush is not very powerful and the battery needs to be constantly charging to get a decent charge. Not great to be honest.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Aide vraiment à avoir une bonne hygiène dentaire !
"
"
Wish you could get the toothbrush without the charger. I’ve got an extra charger now that I’m never going to use.
"
"
Fantastic brush our whole family uses with different heads
"
"
I love it!
"
"
The vitality has a great motor power leaving your mouth feeling very clean after use. The inbuilt time is very handy to remind you to keep brushing for 2 minutes.
"
"
As expected  it a bit bulky
"
"
Works perfectly : great lifetime battery, great minuting fonction and great aspect. I own this since 2017 and it still works perfectly !
"
"
Bon instrument mais pas de chrono aux 30 secondes.
"
"
My teeth feel so clean after!  I smoke, drink red wine, tea, and coffee and I no longer have the stain build up.
"
"
works good right now shouldn't ask for a review for 6 months
"
"
Best for your $
"
"
We bought 3 and 1 of them stopped working. Other 2 work great. Not sure if there is any warranty but I don't think so.
"
"
Bought this as a gift for my wife.  Have one myself.  We both use regularly.
"
"
Cleans my teeth
"
"
I like the brush bristles and how it feels on my teeth/gums. I like that it came with 2 brush heads. However it is noisier than other electric toothbrushes I’ve had before.
"
"
Good toothbrush。
"
"
effective
"
"
Great product! Purchased for my wife and she loves it. Hopefully she doesn't read the title of my review :)
"
"
Great
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush.  I like it very much. 😀
"
"
Perfect toothbrush fast shipping great price thank you amazon.
"
"
Does the job, no settings or extra functions except for a 2 minute timer that is built in and automatic. Overall great, bought another one for a family memeber.
"
"
Exactly as it was described
"
"
We bought this one first and liked it so much we ordered and second one!
"
"
Bon brossage
"
"
My teeth feel so clean. Floss action is great. My teeth are squeaky!
"
"
J'aime...
"
"
Love electric toothbrushes.My teeth feel so clean
"
"
just what I needed and works very well
"
"
Oral B know how to make a toothbrush.  You can buy a ton of different toothbrush heads, so this is a great value in my opinion..
"
"
Its a bit more aggressive than I expected it to be, and the opposite side of the brush is very inconvenient to maneuver. It is worth 15USD though.
"
"
First electric toothbrush. Very impressed with it.
"
"
Love it! Glad I purchased! Seems to do a much better job and my dentist agrees!!
"
"
Great brush
"
"
😁😁😁😁😊😊🤗🤩🤩🤩
"
"
I've had a couple of oral b's over the past years, all of them at the higher price range. I've had no issues with the toothbrush and the price is fantastic.I definitely recommend!
"
"
Love love love it shipping was extremely fast the product is great and the charger works perfect , overall 10/10 really great buy I bought one for me and my husband and he loves it .also at my local stores they were selling this tooth brush for more so it also saved me some money which I'm also happy about
"
"
Good upgrade from a manual brush. Product works well. Con: collects calcium at the base.
"
"
Shopping and product are just as described
"
"
Everything is as expected. Retail packaging, works just fine. Just keep in mind that it is not a lithium battery so don't charge it until it's empty.
"
"
Like the rotating motion and convenient size. Good value for $.I used the product to brush my teeth...and what else would I use it for??
"
"
Brushes teeth
"
"
Works well for the price. Very powerful. Would suggest the sensitive toothbrush head for sensitive gums.
"
"
For washing my teath.I am very happy this product.
"
"
The small recharging station is good and the toothbrush works well
"
"
It's great works well.
"
"
Does a great job. Good power and battery seems to never end
"
"
I recommend this product.
"
"
Teeth are whiter in a week
"
"
also cleans easily there's not much tooth paste build up. I think its a good unit and would buy it again.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Well worth the money
"
"
Good ergonomics, battery life and cost effective.
"
"
Works great, I love it
"
"
Stopped working after 4 uses
"
"
Product works much better than what I expect.  Feels solid in hand.
"
"
It's a great electric toothbrush. I've had it for about 2-3 months now, and it will be time to replace the head soon but that's fine because it came with an extra head :) great value. it works fabulous, I can feel my teeth are cleaner than with a manual brush. You don't even need to leave it plugged; just. Charge once overnight and the charge lasts like a month.
"
"
Great for the price. Works well and perfect for the first time purchasing electronic toothbrush. The timer of 2 minutes is really helpful in keeping track of time. It would be great to have a small light to show when it was being charged.
"
"
Good value and good quality
"
"
Its ok
"
"
its nice with two heads!
"
"
Same as one that retired. Charges easy. Works great
"
"
Brought a back up one for my son. He loves his toothbrush
"
"
We received the Oral-B Toothbrush on time & my wife is extremely pleased with the performance.We highly recommend this Rechargeable Toothbrush.
"
"
Easy to use, rechargeable
"
"
Works really well! I am still within my first month of use, but my gums seem to be tougher than before. Overall design is great.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush - I bought it for my son, and he loved it!
"
"
As headline
"
"
Work perfectly for 1/10 of the price of the other higher models.
"
"
Works great. Feel like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I like the small round brush head.
"
"
Great value and great intro to the electric toothbrush. Highly recommend.
"
"
I've had this for about six months and now the battery won't stay on for more than ten seconds.
"
"
title say it all
"
"
Excellent toothbrush for the young ones (9 and 11yo)
"
"
most highly rated by dentists. they must be paying the dentists!
"
"
Works as intended. I use it everyday and it is still running smooth.
"
"
Works great, I love that it is rechargeable.
"
"
bonjour,en avril 2018 J'ai acheté 2 brosses a dents électrique par contre j'en ai une qui ne fonctionne plus, je voulais savoir si elle est sous garantie encore.merci
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent très bien rien à dire de mal
"
"
Very good for the price although I wish it had a charging light to let you know when it is charged and discharged. I would have preferred that they kept the same bottom shape of the more expensive models
"
"
Pleased
"
"
Great value
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price! First time using the electric and I like it. Cleans very well.
"
"
Ok
"
"
husband loves it but brush too small and he is not too keen on the charge even tho it says ok to leave on the charger!!!
"
"
Work's
"
"
We have only used the toothbrush for a short time but like it very much Carl & Brenda.
"
"
Best 20 bucks I've ever spent. Lasts a long time on a single charge and the head was easy to replace.
"
"
I love this toothbrush, my teeth feel like pearls, and it holds a charge for 4 days. I will but another when this one wears out.
"
"
Bon produit
"
"
Very good
"
"
love it. works great.
"
"
Excellent product. Good unit for you teeth
"
"
Works well
"
"
Have been very satisfied with this product. .... and so is my dentist!!It's easy to use, although does not come with specific instructions, such as HOW to brush.Charge lasts about one week for one person. This item does not have a charge indicator light, but I didn't miss that.
"
"
Great for my kids, even when they are lazy brushes Oral B gives a better brush than a regular toothbrush would.
"
"
excellent
"
"
Great toothbrush.  We will keep with these.
"
"
Excellent brand and feels amazing!
"
"
Works great just like an Oral-B should. Arrived on time and same price as at store came with charger and 2 brushes. All good
"
"
It’s not my first one but it works as expected so I’m happy with it.
"
"
Love this brush it works well and charges quickly
"
"
Works well.
"
"
This toothbrush made my teeth and gums hurts after one use- I recommend spending more money to get the higher rated electric toothbrush.
"
"
Finallly got a replacement after 9 years of use! Works well, durable, long life.
"
"
Inexpensive, effective and dependable
"
"
Good
"
"
excellent, ma copine adore ça, très bon brossage et bonne qualité merci
"
"
Very good
"
"
Was using Philips Soniccare and found Oral B to be a nicer refreshing tooth brush.
"
"
I purchased this one as my previous one had given up the ghost after 18 years. I can only hope for the same longevity on the one I just purchased
"
"
Fonctionne parfaitement et abordable.
"
"
Comme la description ;)
"
"
It works very WELL.  My teeth feel much cleaner then when I use a manual  toothbrush.
"
"
This is the best bang for your buck!
"
"
Great brush. My son uses it daily and enjoys it.
"
"
Very happy with this toothbrush.
"
"
and functional
"
"
Fantastic this is to replace my old one i’ve Had for 10 years
"
"
Very satisfied!
"
"
Works amazing! Great toothbrush
"
"
perfect for a single user..a brush head, toothbrush and charger are all included in the package
"
"
It seems fine ... worth the purchase.  I had battery powered one I liked better though.
"
"
5 star
"
"
Très bien. Peu cher, simple et efficace.Very good and simple. Perfect.
"
"
I really love it! It’s great
"
"
Met expectations
"
"
This tooth brush is just like the more expensive version. It was a timely delivery and I am happy with the product.
"
"
Does what it’s meant to
"
"
Si les batteries durent longtemps (5 ans minimum), se sera un produit parfait.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Very solid and as expected.
"
"
Je suis très dessus je nais pas reçu le bon produit
"
"
It was exactly what I was expecting. I received the toothbrush with two heads and charger.
"
"
this is a great electric toothbrush. After just one use, it feels like a cleaning done at the dentist
"
"
Solide et facile a recharger
"
"
Works as described, no frills electric tooth brush.No complaints and worth the price.
"
"
Exactly what I wanted and does a great job!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Very good unit perhaps even better than older Braun models which had a price 4 times greater.  On par with Sonic.
"
"
👍
"
"
worth the money and very good thank you
"
"
Works great
"
"
The toothbrush that arrived is not the one picture - which is the sole reason I ordered it sooooooooo
"
"
I really like this toothbrush!
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
Work very well, do what it's supposed to do.
"
"
Pour la 2e salle de bain
"
"
Im mister Clean teeth now!
"
"
Cleans really well without being too hard on the gums
"
"
Great product
"
"
It's a toothbrush.
"
"
Handle fine: floss far too hard it blocks the brushes
"
"
This is great. Stays charged for a couple of weeks.
"
"
Love the toothbrush, teeth feels so clean it's just like getting out of the dentist office.
"
"
Perfect the same I did have before  it works very well but the only thing make a funny noise but is ok
"
"
I love the clean feeling it leavesStays charged a long time
"
"
Product worked at first and then completely died. Never got the base wet and always kept it clean. Useless
"
"
Great purchase. Still working years later. Just make sure you swap out brush heads.
"
"
excellent quality
"
"
3 brush heads or 2 and a brush for same price? I think I take the second choice.
"
"
Good basic toothbrush, but the ""floss action"" head is not good. It feels like it is actually damaging your gums. I had to buy a different head. The price was reasonable, but I found it about 20% lower in a local drug store.
"
"
Perfect!
"
"
Bonjour , Je ne peux évaluer le produit car je l'offre en cadeau a Noel .Au plaisir
"
"
Amazing product will buy again

Powerful brushing, long lasting battery
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned! I wear braces and it takes a lot of dirt off my teeth.
"
"
Works great
"
"
I've used this for years. Easy to hold for people with hand and finger problems.
"
"
Broke after using it 4 times, contacted Oral B and they promptly sent me out a replacement
"
"
Oral B makes great toothbrushes. Love the two minute timer.
"
"
Great value. No need to spend $100 plus on an electric toothbrush
"
"
Product is perfect and delivery was on time.
"
"
Really does the job as advertised and sitting on the chargeable base keeps it always ready.
"
"
Just one word, perfect.

Bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
Parfaite
"
"
This tooth brush was just what I was looking for.It met all my expectations - light weight, small head,soft bristle.
"
"
I enjoy the brush. One disadvantage is the cord being in the way if your vanity too is not large.
"
"
This toothbrush works very well.Gives a very deep clean feeling to your mouth.Much much better than a regular toothbrush.Great!
"
"
Love them worth the price...

Excellent value for the money so far. I had a much more expensive oral b electric toothbrush before this, and really liked it. I did not want to pay as much for the replacement, and was delighted to find one that I liked at a more reasonable price. Besides that, it actually is more powerful, and I like the floss action. Being able to use different heads is a bonus. I had 3 left from my previous one and they fit this one. I think if someone had sensitive gums beyond minor sensitivity, they would need to use another tip at first as the floss action is more aggressive, and bigger. Overall I love it so far.
"
"
Oh my god. Used this for the first time right now, and it tore my mouth up. Who knew somebody could get so much vibration from something so small? It hurt when I first used it, but I got used to it after a while. It really feels like 9/10 dentists have tried it before. I'm still tingling. 10/10 Buy, don't rent.
"
"
I haven't been to the dentist in close to fifteen years. Part of the reason is because I used to work at a dentist office and they're kind of a scam. I say ""kind of"" because they're not actually out to scam you like a con man would but the whole ""dentistry"" system is designed for fat cash. Like if there is something that looks like it might need something done to it; they're going to do that thing no matter how much it costs. ""On the x-ray it kind of sort of looks like you might need a super duper expensive root canal so we're going to go ahead and do it."" It's quite possible you needed that root canal but you probably didn't and could live a happy productive life without ever getting that root canal done. It's like that. Like if you eat some crusty bread before going to the dentist and the crust scratches your gums a little so there's like a hint of blood in your mouth, the dentist is going to recommend a whole skin graft procedure for your gums. So anyway this toothbrush: For $20 this thing unbelievable. Use it all the time and you won't need to go to the dentist ever. Take it from some guy that used to work in the file room of a dentists office.
"
"
After four months of use;Awesome brush. Circle shaped head is easy to maneuver around all my teeth, even my back molars. The battery lasts at least a week, easily, before it needs recharging. This is with at least twice a day brushing, sometimes three. It came with a replacement head, so you get 6 months worth of brushing teeth(three months per head). Fit and finish is excellent too, no complaints. Charging base is small and well designed. My only qualm is no travel case. Other than that it is a great product for the price.
"
"
Teeth feel amazing and super clean!!! I Highly recommend this!!  I have told some friend and they have also purchased it. Incredible price too. Thanks Oral B!!
"
"
Great brush for the price. If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles you should look elsewhere but this is a great brush for the money. I previously had one that had a pressure sensor to turn off if you pushed too hard against your teeth but that is far from a necessary feature of a toothbrush. I am quite happy with this one so far.
"
"
this is the third one that we bought. It suppose to come with a SAVING of 10$ in Canada if you register the product...but when we register, there is NO CANADA to click on..so no rebate for Canadian...the previous buy did also the same thing..10$ rebate,,,but not working..i don't like these FALSE advertisingAnyway the toothbrush work very well.
"
"
Been using it for several months now and the toothbrush has worked great. Feels a lot better than using a regular toothbrush, but without all the worrying of spots you might have missed while brushing. Battery life is great, you just need to remember to recharge it once in four or so days, which you can leave overnight on the charging stand.
"
"
I've had this toothbrush since November and has been working great until 2 weeks ago. The toothbrush will only stay on for 30 seconds at a time. At first I thought it may be because it wasn't charged enough (though I leave it plugged over night) so I thought I'd wait it out and see if charging it 24/7 would bring it back. It still does not work like it used to. Will have to buy a new toothbrush, but will go with one that will hopefully last me more than just a couple of months.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I had oral surgery and the brushes are gentle enough not to irritate the area but still work properly to leave my teeth feeling clean and looking great.  Holds a charge well - only needs recharging every 12-14 days or so with daily use.  Fantastic toothbrush and you can't beat the price.
"
"
It's very very tough brush, and it can be damaging for your gum & your teeth.Maybe if you use a VERY light brush and you're careful you might be able to get away with it.. but for me, it just wasn't good at all.I had my gums in pain for almost a week after using this toothbrush.I don't recommend it.
"
"
Very satisfyd
"

Left over features of my original ""oral b""  brush were interchangeable with the new flosser,Wall mounted charger plus the brush heads making the new device an acceptable second brush.

This is an exceptional toothbrush for the price. My old Oral B Sonic Complete toothbrush started giving up on me after 8 years. I could have ordered replacement batteries but it would have cost the same as this Oral B Vitality when on sale.The Vitality is fairly different from my old brush. The first noticeable difference is size. The handle on the Vitality is thicker than the Sonic Complete which I originally interpreted as cheap. Of course after two weeks of use I've become accustomed to the size and don't think twice about it.The second difference is its oscillation strength. The Vitality is much more abrasive than my old brush. Where as the Sonic Complete gave a gentle vibration this brush is aggressive. I've had to change how I brush - I let the brush do all the work and simply hold on the brush in place. My teeth do feel cleaner than before.I don't find it cleans my tongue as well but it likely has to do with the brush heads. There are several head options available and I'll be trying something like the Dual Action head to see how it cleans my tongue.I don't miss the charging light or brush settings. I only used the first brush setting and didn't give the charging light any attention on my old brush.There is one thing I didn't like. The package is almost dangerous to remove. The package is sealed on all four sides PLUS the hanging hole. I recommend using a very sharp knife or scissors to open the package - with extreme caution of course. Cut the bottom and two sides and open upward. The sealed hanging hole makes it hard to open from the top down.
"
"
I have expected great quality from oral b. Battery life is to less, and there is no indication of battery level. Better stay away.
"
"
This is the first electric toothbrush I have bought. Maybe it's me but I couldn't use it properly. I am going back to my regular toothbrush. My suggestion is, if you are happy with your manual toothbrush, don't waste your money on this.
"
"
I loved the performance of this toothbrush but despite daily cleaning the buildup of mold in the brush head was disgusting and very hard to remove. I tossed it.
"
"
I purchased this for my husband for Christmas, and also received one from my wish list.  Noticed that the power started to get low a few days ago and my husband's and now mine barely comes on. I bought this based on all the good reviews, but within less than three weeks, both of them are duds.
"
"
I usually don't post reviews but seriously guys - this toothbrush is amazing!This is the first long-term electric toothbrush I've owned and I'm so glad I bought it. My teeth feel insanely clean after I brush my teeth - kind of like when you step right out of the dentist.I'm actually excited about brushing my teeth now lol. Which is usually the part of my routine I dread the most. But not with this brush!
"
"
Works great. I charged it once since it got delivered. Still working. Good battery life
"
"
I have been using a lot of manual toothbrushes, but after using this toothbrush I would never go back to a manual toothbrushes.
"

I have been using electric toothbrushes, beginning with a much more expensive Philips Sonicare toothbrush, for several years. After I broke two of the Sonicare toothbrushes (probably by pressing too hard on them), I bought the Vitality because it was the cheapest electric toothbrush around. To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did. The Oral-B Vitality has a small round brush which can get into hard-to-reach areas and to hard-to-reach surfaces that the large brush on the Sonicare couldn't. Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush. After I switched to the Oral-B Vitality my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were! You can get Oral-B electric toothbrushes with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well. The batteries of cordless electric toothbrushes eventually wear out (after several years, depending on use), but replacement of the low-priced Vitality is affordable.I have also used several different toothbrush heads with the Vitality, but the Floss Action brush is by far my favourite. It's unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.  I highly recommend this toothbrush & brush-head combination.

Our previous Oral-B electric died and I went looking for a replacement.  This item stood out as being much cheaper than the others.  The quality still seems good though, we've been happy with its performance.  Certainly not the best on the market but still much more effective than using a manual toothbrush.

For a first time user of this product, I have to say I am very impressed. I have been an avid manual brush user for most of my life. Excluding my childhood when I did use an electric toothbrush. I wasn't sure what to expect for the price? I had my reservations. I have used some pretty cheap electric brushes when I was a child and found them to be lacking. Many years have passed since the days of really cheaply made electric brushes. I could be wrong and they still may be out there, but I have to say this brush is not one of them!My teeth felt like I had just come out of a dentist visit for a cleaning. They were literally squeaky clean! I was amazed at the results I have been missing with a manual tooth brush. And I have spent a pretty penny on supposedly effective manual brushes that made a lot of false promises.This toothbrush makes it so much more easier to clean after meals. It has some nice features like a water proof base so you can immediately put your brush back on the charger while it's wet. It also pulsates twice when you press too hard on the brush against your teeth.I think I will be a life long user of this product, because you can't beat the quality for the price, and the effectiveness that manuals just don't produce.
"

I am disappointed with the battery autonomy.  It's charge last less than a week.  These NiMH batteries are a real disappointmentThe old Braun that I replaced with this one, although using a NiCad battery, had a charge that would last for several weeks, allowing you to take it on a trip without needing a charger (camping, travels, whatever).The same brush comes in different versions (because packaged with different head), and the floss-action head that comes with this one works relatively well. It actually dislodges some debris that may be stuck between your teeth, which normally only a toothpick or flossing could remove.  Not as good as flossing, but better than other brushes.I'm not going to give it a horrible mark, because got it on special for fifteen bucks, so the quality is proportional to what was spent.  But I didn't get the great deal that I expected. Just my money's worth, nothing more.
"
"
Simple, effective and great value when on sale! However, if you’re hoping to brush your teeth without making a sound... (ie. potentially waking up your roommate, partner or sleeping baby) move on.My previous expensive competitive brand toothbrush died on me recently and although I was always complimented by my dentist for having well cared for teeth and gums, I was miffed that it didn’t have a way to replace the battery without damaging the underside of the toothbrush.It did take a little getting used from switching over from the full headed toothbrushes, but once I felt how clean it made my teeth I quickly converted.I’m really happy with this purchase and realize that even the expensive electric toothbrushes only have about a 2 year shelf life, so I’m not about to fork out for something that has frills when I can have something that does the job perfectly well for less.
"
"
Right off, there is no need to buy a more expensive one. This works as well as could possibly be. I'm super happy with this purchase.This one uses the standard Oral-B brush heads you can buy in bulk, which in my opinion are just as good as the way-over-the-top price of the name brand ones.This is replacing a 10 year old Braun / Oral-B electric toothbrush that finally would not hold a charge. In going to the new one, I've discovered a couple of things:1) The new ones really are better than the older ones. This new one is stronger & faster in brushing than the old one ever was.2) The ergonomics are better now - small changes that reflect a refining & evolution of design.3) My old one had a large base that could be mounted to a wall, this new one has a small base that can't be mounted to the wall that tips over constantly.I haven't come to a conclusion on the brushing head that comes with it. No complaints, but I can't really say I think it's better than the much cheaper standard bulk heads I've bought in the past on Amazon.
"
"
The motor is very powerful. You brush your teeth like a dentist, pressing the brush against one tooth at a time. It gives your gums a good workout. One problem is that if you don't put the brush in your mouth precisely flat, you get bumps from the plastic on the rotating head. They can feel like hard blows against your teeth. The timer measures two minutes by short pauses in the motor operation. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this purchase. It is a high quality brush at a much smaller price than you can get it in stores.
"
"
We decided to save money by replacing our old 230v electric tooth brushes with these ones here in Canada, but the quality is really lacking. They feel so cheap and I feel like I get a better brushing just using a normal toothbrush. I miss how our other toothbrushes would vibrate 4x during the cycle to let you know when to switch to another section of your teeth. The most annoying thing about these toothbrushes is that there is a little hole in the brush head on the shaft that drains sometimes, so if you are brushing your teeth, you end up randomly spilling toothpaste/spit on your shirt even when your mouth was closed while brushing. It's really annoying and I ruin so many shirts if I get dressed before brushing my teeth. I can't wait to replace these!
"
"
This flosser replaced my earlier Oral-B flosser from 10 years ago.  My brush heads from the older model worked on this one.  I found the brush heads that came with this unit was too stiff for my gums.  My dental recommended a softer bruch head.  The unit seem more powerful than the old one and the timer was set for two minutes.  Everything is working well after three months.  Highly recommended.
"
"
The brush is round, and not too large; I find that it is the perfect size for my teeth. There is a timer, where it will cycle through not spinning 4 times at the 2 minute mark. Easy to use, easy to store. When I first used it, I found that it didn't last more than two brushes; later I learned that it wasn't fully charged (just charged long enough to test it) and now that it's fully charged it does last longer. The price is great, it came with replacement heads.It's a little loud, which is typical for a lot of these types of toothbrushes, so for the person first trying it out, there might be a bit of fear and anxiety because of the noise, but it makes brushing so much more efficient, easy, and for me, it's fun. I have problems with brushing my teeth too aggressively, but this has helped me remove that habit.Personally, when I used a regular toothbrush I could not get that smooth, glossy feeling on the back of my front teeth. I also could not easily reach my back teeth without gagging. With this brush, I get that clean feeling on the back of my teeth, and I can also reach the furthest teeth in the back and brush around them easily. No gagging, except for when I brush my tongue, which is normal for me.This was an awesome buy for me.
"
"
I like the fact that I charged it fully and it has kept it's charge for over two weeks of use twice a day. It makes my teeth feel like they do after the dentist cleaning. As you can tell, I am totally happy . I put off buying an electric tooth brush as I have no where in the bathroom to keep the charger plugged in, not necessary with this.. totally satisfied
"
"
I grabbed this toothbrush when it was on sale. I really like it as it seems powerful and well built. The only downside is that my gums always bleed after using it. So people with sensitive teeth need to be aware of this before purchasing it. Otherwise it is a good purchase when on sale.
"
"
I bought this for myself and was able to try the bristles on my teeth for about .2 seconds before freaking put and deciding that I would not be able to use the product. My boyfriend on the other hand loves it!!! I think some people just have sensitive mouths. I have never had a cavity and wanted an electric brush to ensure my continued success, while also be kinder to my gums. For me it will always be a regular old toothbrush.
"
"
This toothbrush is great! Every time I'm finished brushing my teeth, I feel like I just came back from the dentist. A few reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I believe it should come with a cover for the brush head instead of buying it separately and also the power of the brush itself  is a bit too powerful that for the first few times you use it on your front teeth, it will hurt.
"
"
After barely two months, it starts and stops without rhyme or reason.  Whether it is on the charger or off, doesn't matter.In the middle of the night it will turn itself on, in the middle of the day it will turn itself on.  Finally just let it die out and threw it in the garbage.  Waste of money.
"
"
This oral-b does not disappoint. This is my second oral-b electric tooth brush, I love the way these tooth brushes preform, you just can't get that same over all clean feeling with a manual brush no matter how long you brush. Be aware that this model has no bells and whistles, it is a very basic 2D model. It oscillates and rotates and has the 2 minute timer, but that's about it. That's all I need my toothbrush to do, and for 25.00 dollars it's even more then I could ask for. It also comes with 2 removable brushes and another feature I liked is that it accepts just about all oral-b brush heads. For people that want something simple that does what it's supposed to do, I would definitely recommend this product.
"
"
If you want an electric toothbrush, and you should, Oral B is the way to go.  If you want a basic model that brushes teeth, then this is it.  If you want timers, alarms, bells and whistles then you can spend more on a different model.  I just want to brush my teeth and this model does that perfectly.
"
"
Durable and powerful - you can definitely feel the difference in a great way! Also has great battery life and quick charge.  One minor drawback is that it's so strong there might be residual splashing of toothpaste foam, which is not evident at first but will appear as little white splotches on your faucet and mirror. Very easy to clean though.
"
"
I especially like the price of this toothbrush, and find it has great value for the money!  I use this toothbrush, along with enzymatic toothpaste on my dog's teeth. It not only keeps the tartar from building up on his teeth, but also keeps his breath fresh.
"
"
A bit messy, but I’m getting used to it.  Leaves my mouth feeling really clean.  Easy to use and to keep clean.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and I must admit they do a much better job than a manual brush.
"

For my teeth it's  preferable than Sonic care since it's  more agile around the teeth because it rotates rather than moving  up down which allows pivoting from every angle and meaningfully. Does vibrate though and I a  larger brush would be nice. Wonder,  but don't  know, if diff brush  refills than it comes with would be nice. Also comes with Nickel battery. Lithium?  But higher cost.
"
"
Can't believe I waited so long to finally convert to an electric brush. My teeth feel so much cleaner after every brush. The time function is great for making sure that you're not over or under brushing
"
"
I bought 2 of these for my kids 8 years old, They seem to like it better than manual brush.  Package came with 1 extra head.  CONS, they should make it in different colors as my kids share the washroom and I had to put on different brush head so they know which one is theirs.
"
"
My dental hygienist suggested this electric toothbrush to help delay worsening of receding gums. I like how good my gums feel after brushing and the floss action head is great for getting between the teeth.
"
"
I've been using the Oral-B Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for about a week now and I love it. My teeth feel clean and smooth. The timer option is really helpful. I have to be careful not too press down too hard or else I hurt my gums but other than that, this toothbrush is a keeper.
"
"
This is my third Vitality toothbrush and they work just as well as the more expensive Oral-B ones.I purchased this one to leave at work.
"
"
This is what I was expecting, although it's a little aggressive for my gums. It's not something I can use every morning and night, but does it ever clean! Feels like I've had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. I will continue to use it every few days.
"
"
Dont know how to use the timer and no indicator to say whether its charging.The toothbrush i got is not the one in the photos.
"
"
Using it for two years with zero problem. Often there is so.e kind of deposit that grow between the brush and the charget, which can be easily washed away. That is not a problem.
"
"
When I originally was thinking of switching to an electric toothbrush the cost seemed a bit high and I wasn't convinced it would be that much better. This brush is awesome I can actually feel the heads getting between my teeth as I brush. I would recommend this one to anyone great value for money.
"
"
It’s a good investissent! It’s a good price, for quality!! Works good!! And Oral B one of the top marks recommended by a dentist!
"
"
Everything I wanted in a toothbrush.It's a bit stiffer than most toothbrushes but it's exactly what I needed. It cleans to my gums cleaning the plaque that gives me gingervitis.This plus the waterpik equals a clean and healthy mouth.
"
"
I bought it to replace my old electric toothbrush which is probably around 10 years old. It seems to be much better. Has much higher RPM and cleans tooth and gums much better.
"
"
This toothbrush makes me feel like I just came from the dentist every time I use it! Love the sensor to let me know once my 2 minutes are up. Works amazing.
"
"
It's a cheap electric toothbrush.  Works good. Not as fast as the more expensive models but definitely does what it's supposed to.
"
"
Excellent.  I should have got this years ago. My teeth feel so clean and I'm sure I'm getting all the plaque and tartar.I recommend this to everyone. Don't forget to floss. :)
"
"
Enfin mes enfants se brosse bien les dents. Seul problème c'est qu'il n'y a pas de voyant lumineux pour voir si la brosse à dent est rechargée
"
"
Battery completely died a couple days ago.  It's only been charged every 5 to 6 days and only overnight.  Not worth the money.
"
"
I've used this for a few weeks now and am very happy I purchased it. My biggest qualm with my past electric toothbrush was the changing of the battery, but having this rechargeable is wonderful. It also holds a charge for quite a few days so good for short travel trips too.
"
"
Horrible toothbrush.  I ordered it based on the reviews, and it feels like I am brushing my teeth with a diesel powered screw driver.  Really unusable.
"
"
Having using for five or six months now. Really enjoy. It’s a little bit on the loud side, but works well.
"
"
Awesome for the price! I have been using it at night for just over a week and I can see and feel a difference. My teeth feel so clean afterwards!
"
"
The price is amazing for a rechargeable.With two OralB heads as well.Happy Camper.
"
"
Had my prior Oral B for 8 Plus years... well it died and I love the electric brushes... love it.
"
"
Everything other than the battery life is fine. A much deeper clean than manual toothbrush but can be abrasive for people with gum sensitivity.
"
"
Works great but I wish the battery life would last longer for weekend trips.  Good value for the money
"
"
My last one lasted 8 years.... only the battery that gave out on my old one.......  love it!
"
"
My first one, purchased in 2005, finally quit.I bought a replacement at a drug store for $36CADThen I happened to see this listed on Amazon at a price I couldn't refuse.Having both, I alternate each day and they each last for 8 years in daily use, these won't need to be replaced until 2029.I'll need replacement before then... :)
"
"
Does an excellent job of teeth brushing.  My previous Braun brush had been in daily use for 17 years and was getting a bit tired.  This new one seems to do a better job the the previous one ever did.
"
"
Very good product.  Battery lasts for almost three weeks without charging.  Speed of brush is much faster than the original one I purchased several years ago.
"
"
The Braun base combined with Oral B is a win, win.  Good quality all the way.
"
"
I bought this for my son on his dentist's recommendation. It's one of the simpler models but it's effective and well priced.
"
"
Great for travelling as we have a full sized one already. Holds charge well so you don't have to take the charger with you for shorter trips. Works great. Thanks
"
"
Real nice, bought for my oldest son, he now actually brushes his teeth!!!
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Good speed and power. Makes your teeth feel very clean. Just about to buy my husband one but the item is showing no longer available. Too bad.
"
"
I bought this to replace an old model of the same make..this one seems to do a better job..perhaps it's the  brush
"
"
Works well for an entry-level brush. We also have the 7000 Pro series brushes, and this is NOT as nice as the higher end ones, but for a low price, it works as expected.
"
"
All of the family use these, works fine replacement for a dropped and old one
"
"
Durable, cleans teeth really well. compct. I would buy again.
"
"
Cleans my teeth better than any other tooth brush I've used. Very pleased.
"
"
Works well and easy to change heads. Comes with the stand charger but the brush itself is cordless for easy use. Good value for the price.
"
"
Répond aux attentes, mais un étui pour la brossette aurait été pratique pour le transport.
"
"
So much better than the battery operated ones I've been using. Thought the brush head might be too small to be effective but it works great.
"
"
Works amazing and got it for a great deal. Can’t belive it came with a charger as well.
"
"
I purchased this under the discount.  For the past 10 months, it has been running pretty smoothly all the time, even if sometimes I forget to charge the battery it can still run for several days.Would recommend to whom want a decent toothbrush.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Would not charge with the stand provided, but would charge with my husband's stand.  Had to return.
"
"
powerful enough to me, battery lasts for about 2 wks, wireless charging is safe and convenient. Not quite sure about the actual floss action though, I guess better than a manual brush. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the noise.
"
"
Great toothbrush. It cleans well and I dont have to put in much effort, which is important to me because I usually fall asleep in the bathroom.
"
"
It is great for the price! I have braces so I need a toothbrush that cleans my teeth as much as possible without taking a lot of my time. It has floss action that works in between teeth that saves my time. Great product!
"
"
Love this brush so well worth the money, works just as well and any super expensive brush. Good battery life
"
"
so far so good. its completely waterproof, so I brush my teeth while I shower, the docking mechanism doesn't have any exposed metal connectors ( or any kind of connectors for that matter, what kind of sorcery is charging this thing?)
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I ever had....It is very strong.
"
"
It's affordable and not gimmicky - like some of the other electric brushes. One improvement might be a light that indicates when the unit is charging and when it is fully charged. Other than that - no complaints.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien et elle est puissante, très bon brossage, efficace.
"
"
Greatest power toothbrush I ever had.
"
"
Doesn't turning on after 1.5 month of use
"
"
Great toothbrush, but I regret not taking the one for sensitive teeth/gums. Although I didn't think I needed sensitive, this toothbrush makes my gums bleed. So, I will buy a pack of sensitive bristle heads.
"
"
Good to keep the plak down.
"
"
Works ok for the price but no battery charge light so I don't know when the battery needs charging. I bought 2 and Oral-B refuses to honor the 2nd $7 discount coupon. Never had this prob with Braun.
"
"
My dentist highly recommended this rotating brush and it is great.
"
"
Works as you would expect
"
"
Liked everything. Unbelievable fast delivery received the order in about 24hours of placing it
"
"
good  for bring at work
"
"
The brush that came with the unit is very traumatic .  I used regular brush and works great.
"
"
does what it's supposed to ; )
"
"
It does an excellent job of cleaning
"
"
Cleans well, and family really likes it. Charge last pretty long. Comfortable grip. Teeth really feel cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.
"
"
Comparable to the electronic toothbrush my friend bought at $100+, totally functional and don't need to worry about recharging. Clean teeth from all angles.
"
"
Love it.  Ordering another one for my dog.
"
"
Before I tried one, I always assumed electric brushes are for lazy folk. Until I tried one....and wow, I can't ever go back. My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist, albeit twice a day.
"
"
This was a great price for a great product that works perfectly. Would absolutely recommend to anyone that is looking for a new toothbrush
"
"
Love this tooth brush
"
"
Its an ok electric toothbrush for the money but doesnt rotate already as quickly as when I first started using. Still, its better then a manual toothbrush
"
"
good buy and the heads were great as well
"
"
Product was a gift. Timely delivery and product was exactly as advertised.
"
"
Love my toothbrush. It's been over 4 months now since professional cleaning and I got this brush right after, so my teeth never felt cleaner. Good buy and it was almost $10 cheaper than at Rexall.
"
"
Really does the job well
"
"
Nothing too fancy, basic electric toothbrush. Personally love it as I just made the shift from non electric brushes. Definitely a good model to start with.
"
"
tooth brush is the first electric one i have had, works great and really makes your teeth feel like new again!
"
"
best value in rechargeable electric toothbrushes.  floss action is a super deep clean.  better than expected power.
"
"
average low gam
"
"
Works great.  Teeth feel clean.
"
"
amazing product
"
"
Great tooth brush. Long lasting battery (Lithium Ion). Love it
"
"
Love it, makes oral hygiene care so quick and efficient.
"
"
My teeth feel cleaner.  I wish I had bought this sooner!
"
"
I honestly forgot how clean my teeth feel with an electric toothbrush, this is great and totally affordable, plus it comes with an extra head!
"
"
Purchased this as a gift for a family member and haven't heard any complaints. They've told me that it's far superior to a manual toothbrush
"
"
Replaced the same model. So far so good.
"
"
just replaced my 10 yr old oral-b. Hope this new one goes 10yrs
"
"
Only lasted 90 days Ugh!
"
"
they do a good job cleaning
"
"
Works great. Can't go wrong with Oral B. really like the flossing action. Teeth feel really clean after using it.
"
"
Good unit
"
"
Good
"
"
So happy to have an electric toothbrush that works! My last one literally died and I had to use it like a manual toothbrush until this one arrive. Whole family is using Oral-B electric toothbrushes now.
"
"
Works well Had one the same but battery quit
"
"
Good quality toothbrush
"
"
Bon produit
"
"
Good Product overall. Cheaper than most electric brushes out there, but the head tend to be a bit too strong for its own good, and makes a mess.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush. As advertised. Base doesn't have a light or charging indicator, but the brush hasn't died yet so I assume it's charging!
"
"
Great product. Got this for my husband as he lost his old one on the road and he loves loves it.
"
"
Works great! Great value for money
"
"
Love this tooth brush, read some negative reviews before purchasing... but bought it anyways and I haven't been disappointed.
"
"
for 35 $ can't beat it.
"
"
Works awesome. Love the floss action, big improvement to my gums in a few weeks!
"
"
Nice product

Excellent little electric toothbrush. Affordable, effective, charge lasts for 2 weeks! Easy to clean and takes up so little space.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Fonctionne bien tel que decrit
"
"
Absolutely nothing to complain about, although this is my first electric toothbrush. I am definitely never going back to a manual one. I especially like the two minute timer feature.
"
"
Real from my sonic one, cleans between teeth excellent, and little noisy but ok. Lite weight.
"
"
Very happy with how it cleans my teeth
"
"
It vibrated so hard that I feel like it is going to knock my teeth out.  No electric toothbrush needs to slam teeth so hard.
"
"
Lots of power
"
"
It was a replacement for one I've had for years and was what I expected
"
"
Worth every dollar! I'm glad i didn't spend for something that does the same thing as this one. Works well, charges fast and long battery life...nothing else is needed!
"
"
Very good the toothbrush for this price .
"

Seems very good

good item for the price..everyday I be brushing yo!

Toujours eu ce genre de brosse a dents. Elle est encore pareil depuis maintenant plusieurs années donc, ceci reflete la qualité du produit.
"

This is my second Oral B and the quality is great.
"
"
Works fine
"
"
I like it very much. Simple and does what I wanted. They could take a little more time to explain clearly how best to use it.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
All the reviews were right.  This is by far the best electric toothbrush out there.  I bought 2 when it was on sale.  My gums definitely look and feel healthier after a week of using this toothbrush.
"
"
Best tooth brush so far. Recommend to anyone who's interested in changing an auto brush
"
"
Everytime I'm moving to a new country I'm buying one of those. Do its job perfectly.
"
"
Works great.  No problems so far
"
"
Great
"
"
Love the 'flossing' pieces that are in the bristles. They work great to get things out like popcorn!I'll definitely be buying these again.
"
"
I have had used this toothbrush for over two years, Its a great cheap toothbrush that gets the job done. Highly recommend
"
"
bought for hubby he adores it... so good for his gums.. his words..the best electric brush he has ever had. good price too.
"
"
Works as expected.
"
"
works great, my daughter loves it.
"
"
Love it.
"
"
It's OK. I believe flossing & using the mouth wash, in one word determination is more important for having healthy teeth & gums. Glad I didn't spend a crazy amount for my electric tooth brush.
"
"
Works like a charm. Arrived very fast!
"
"
After using a regular toothbrush for 32 years this was a game changer.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush !!! Thank you.
"
"
I have had several oral b rechargeable toothbrushes and are a very good product.  Like the timer and floss action.
"
"
Great buy!!! Great Price

I don't have the best history with electric toothbrushes, they all tend to stop working very early into use. Here's some background information for why I have bad experience with toothbrushes and why I gave this product 5/5. Bought quite a few electric toothbrushes, after a month I noticed that it starts to lose power, sure it can be the battery, but I changed it multiple times and it does not provide the same strength as they did when new, some of them just stopped working, press the button hear a quiet buzz but no action. So I decided to try this product out and if it hadn't worked as it did I would have gone to manual brushes since they can't break mechanically. Didn't buy this with high hope since reviews on the previous ones were also very good and they didn't live up to the expectation I had. So a month in and it was still working as new, I was blown away. Now it's been a year and the only thing i've had to replace is the brush head. I am extremely glad I came across this before another brush which would have undoubtedly deterred me from purchasing anymore electric brushes. So I would recommend this brush for those who have had the same issues with other brushes as this one does seem to be a good durable product.
"
"
At first, I wasn't a believer in electronic toothbrushes. I thought they were just a gimmick (an expensive one at that), and that a manual toothbrush is just as good as an electric one. But after my package arrived (Arrived only after 2 days) and I tried it out I fell in love with this product. This product comes with an extra head, as well as a recharge pad (place the toothbrush on it, and it recharges), which was a pleasant surprise from the expected AA batteries. At first, the toothbrush felt rough against my teeth, and my gums bled a bit. But after regularly using this device, it no longer feels rough against my teeth, and my teeth truly feel clean after using it.10/10, Best purchase of my life.
"
"
I have had an earlier model of this for 4 years now and still going strong so I wanted to get one for my wife. They also have this model variant which is perfect for kids.Pros:- rechargeable, and this new one has a smaller charging base which is good for small counters- timer goes off at 2 minutes by turning the unit off and on in quick little buzzes which is perfect (my daughter gets it and it works well to help her get into good brushing habits)- lots of compatible brush headsCons:- brush head replacements (at least the official manufacturer ones) are quite expensive- no intermittent timer to tell you when you've done 30 seconds in a zone of teethOverall this brush is good value, at only $30 you get a good rechargeable toothbrush. I don't know why you would spend more on a brush that has bluetooth or other fancy things when this one works perfectly. It's also perfect for kids, I'd rather spend this and get this nicer brush than get the cheap $10 brushes that last only a few weeks.
"
"
A very reasonably priced toothbrush that provides a thorough, refreshing clean. The 2-minute timer is great with letting you know if you've brushed for long enough. I switched to an electric toothbrush because my gums were receding (the dentist told me I was brushing too hard with a manual brush) and this new brush has minimised, if not eliminated, the problem. It's definitely a good value brush for the price, which was my main concern when looking for an electric toothbrush. The battery lasts for a few days, so you don't need to worry about having it plugged in constantly, but the plug also provides a good base/stand for the brush, so you can leave it plugged in all the time without hassle. I thoroughly recommend to anyone who needs a good electric toothbrush on a budget!
"
"
This is a decent electric toothbrush for a decent price but if you have sensitive gums you might want to buy another type of head for it...I love the brush and the price but the head that comes with it is very aggressive...it's like brushing your teeth with a mini grinder..lol  I still have my sonic toothbrush (which I prefer) but I can't find replacement heads for it anywhere which is why I bought this one. Generic heads are very cheap for this which is another plus so basically be careful buying electric toothbrush brands that aren't common in North America as the heads can be hard to find.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist. I decided to grab the cheapest, best reviewed one off amazon and WOW!First time users, make sure you dont turn it on before its in your mouth like I did (my toothpaste ended up on my bathrobe). Behold, the sheer power of the brush! The little rubber ""flossers"" really gave my gums quite the deep tissue massage. I was a bit skeptical by how intense this ""brushing"" felt, but at the end of the two minutes (it really does tell you when the time is up by a pulsing vibe!) I rinsed my mouth and WOW. Mouth never felt so clean.Great value for the price. Just bought one for my husband too!
"
"
I'm pretty disappointed with these. I guess I shouldn't expect too much for the price, but they get super slimy and gross under where the brush head is attached. I have to remove the brush head and clean it underneath everytime I use it so it doesn't build up and get stinky and slimy. I've actually stopped using mine altogether because it's not worth it. The actual cleaning capability isn't terrible but I don't love it either. I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting a higher quality electric toothbrush. Ideally go with Sonicare they're a lot better.
"
"
Solid electric toothbrush at a reasonable price, especially on sale when its priced around $20. There are other more expensive options available by Oral-B and other brands which don't justify the price, but these do a really good job of cleaning your teeth as is the purpose of all brushes, so it is a sensible buy for anyone. Been using it for around 2 years now and its still working perfectly fine without any issues.
"
"
I've never owned an electronic brush, decided to try a lower budget one because who wants to spend $150+ on a tooth brush. I've owned this for a few months now, it works great. 2 minute timer that vibrates off and on near the end and it comes with a replacement brush.Be on the lookout for them in Superstore as I've seen them as low as $21. Otherwise it's definitely worth the price on Amazon.
"
"
I purchased this item from Amazon in 2015. I still have the exact same brush, and I have no issues with battery life.Comes with a nifty little stand that charges the brush, and I can use third party brush heads (no name brand) as well. The brush is also easy to clean and my dentist has noted the improvement in the health of my teeth.I would highly recommend this brush.The ONLY downside I have experienced is that if you are buying those neat little brush cases (that cover the head), they usually do not fit because the head attachment is too thick to fit them.Otherwise, well worth the buy. Here's to another 3 years!

They also have this model variant which is perfect for kids.Pros:- rechargeable, and this new one has a smaller charging base which is good for small counters- timer goes off at 2 minutes by turning the unit off and on in quick little buzzes which is perfect (my daughter gets it and it works well to help her get into good brushing habits)- lots of compatible brush headsCons:- brush head replacements (at least the official manufacturer ones) are quite expensive- no intermittent timer to tell you when you've done 30 seconds in a zone of teethOverall this brush is good value, at only $30 you get a good rechargeable toothbrush. I don't know why you would spend more on a brush that has bluetooth or other fancy things when this one works perfectly. It's also perfect for kids, I'd rather spend this and get this nicer brush than get the cheap $10 brushes that last only a few weeks.

A very reasonably priced toothbrush that provides a thorough, refreshing clean. The 2-minute timer is great with letting you know if you've brushed for long enough. I switched to an electric toothbrush because my gums were receding (the dentist told me I was brushing too hard with a manual brush) and this new brush has minimised, if not eliminated, the problem. It's definitely a good value brush for the price, which was my main concern when looking for an electric toothbrush. The battery lasts for a few days, so you don't need to worry about having it plugged in constantly, but the plug also provides a good base/stand for the brush, so you can leave it plugged in all the time without hassle. I thoroughly recommend to anyone who needs a good electric toothbrush on a budget!

This is a decent electric toothbrush for a decent price but if you have sensitive gums you might want to buy another type of head for it...I love the brush and the price but the head that comes with it is very aggressive...it's like brushing your teeth with a mini grinder..lol  I still have my sonic toothbrush (which I prefer) but I can't find replacement heads for it anywhere which is why I bought this one. Generic heads are very cheap for this which is another plus so basically be careful buying electric toothbrush brands that aren't common in North America as the heads can be hard to find.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush on the recommendation of my dentist. I decided to grab the cheapest, best reviewed one off amazon and WOW!First time users, make sure you dont turn it on before its in your mouth like I did (my toothpaste ended up on my bathrobe). Behold, the sheer power of the brush! The little rubber ""flossers"" really gave my gums quite the deep tissue massage. I was a bit skeptical by how intense this ""brushing"" felt, but at the end of the two minutes (it really does tell you when the time is up by a pulsing vibe!) I rinsed my mouth and WOW. Mouth never felt so clean.Great value for the price. Just bought one for my husband too!
"
"
I'm pretty disappointed with these. I guess I shouldn't expect too much for the price, but they get super slimy and gross under where the brush head is attached. I have to remove the brush head and clean it underneath everytime I use it so it doesn't build up and get stinky and slimy. I've actually stopped using mine altogether because it's not worth it. The actual cleaning capability isn't terrible but I don't love it either. I'd recommend spending a bit more and getting a higher quality electric toothbrush. Ideally go with Sonicare they're a lot better.
"
"
Solid electric toothbrush at a reasonable price, especially on sale when its priced around $20. There are other more expensive options available by Oral-B and other brands which don't justify the price, but these do a really good job of cleaning your teeth as is the purpose of all brushes, so it is a sensible buy for anyone. Been using it for around 2 years now and its still working perfectly fine without any issues.
"
"
I've never owned an electronic brush, decided to try a lower budget one because who wants to spend $150+ on a tooth brush. I've owned this for a few months now, it works great. 2 minute timer that vibrates off and on near the end and it comes with a replacement brush.Be on the lookout for them in Superstore as I've seen them as low as $21. Otherwise it's definitely worth the price on Amazon.
"
"
I purchased this item from Amazon in 2015. I still have the exact same brush, and I have no issues with battery life.Comes with a nifty little stand that charges the brush, and I can use third party brush heads (no name brand) as well. The brush is also easy to clean and my dentist has noted the improvement in the health of my teeth.I would highly recommend this brush.The ONLY downside I have experienced is that if you are buying those neat little brush cases (that cover the head), they usually do not fit because the head attachment is too thick to fit them.Otherwise, well worth the buy. Here's to another 3 years!
"
"
I have a sonicare, but wanted to try a Braun as some family members preferred it.  It does do a decent cleaning job, but I found the brush heads of the sonicare were softer (even though I purchased soft Braun brush heads).  Also, I really dislike that the Braun head has 2 holes that can hold residual fluid from brushing your teeth, and even rinsing with water doesn’t get rid of all of it.  And so when returning your brush to the charger, the fluid sleeps down and makes a ring at the base that always needs cleaning.  The sonicare doesn’t do this.  It’s annoying and that’s why this brush only gets a 4 star.
"
"
I had an oral B electronic toothbrush for many years and it finally kicked the bucket. After several weeks of brushing my teeth up and down and round and round with a good old fashioned brush, I decided to splurge and buy myself another oral B electronic toothbrush. I’m pretty sure this thing crossed paths with an F15 eagle aircraft en route to my house, because the speed is unlike anything I’ve ever been privy to in my life. I didn’t even last the two minute timer and my spit was bright pink and full of blood. It’s like my gums went to the mall and sat in a massage chair on speed. I recommend this brush if you never want to visit the dentist again. I’m pretty sure it’ll remove plaque, fight cavities, and put any crooked teeth back in place in under two minutes!
"
"
Worked well for 3 years, but the battery life was pretty poor by the time I decided to upgrade.This is a good introduction to electric toothbrushes without having to shell out a lot of money for something that may not be for you. Oral B also used the same heads for all its brushes, so when you decide to switch you wont have to stock up again.Pro tip: you can get large packs of brush heads on Amazon for a much cheaper price than in store :) around 2-3$ a head vs. 10$
"
"
If I could rate it at zero I would.  Within a month the toothbrush would turn on on it's own with no way of turning it off.  It is now unusable and in the garbage.  The sad thing is, I researched the brand and this was highly recommended.  I realize there are defective products but this one takes the cake.  I have had other electric toothbrushes that lasted a long time even though they only costed a few dollars.  I will not take a chance again on this brand. Very disappointed!
"
"
Considering the price point this is good value. It is a replacement for the last generation model. It has an improved battery. One suggestion. Do not store it in the charger. I did that with the old one and it killed the battery over time. I opted to buy new rather than change the battery because the old one was 5 years old and although it seemed mechanically OK I thought its time was limited and it had served me well.
"
"
Je viens de recevoir la brosse à dent et c est le modèle standard de wall mart , mauvaise représentation photo ! Ce n est pas leModèle en photo ! Mais le bleu ciel a l ancienne très déçu
"
"
Anyone who hasn't owned an electric toothbrush are missing out! This is so convenient and it really improved my oral hygiene. Just leave it charging in the washroom to be used anytime. I feel like I'm also saving on waste from only buying the brush tips instead of buying new toothbrushes all the time.
"
"
This is a fantastic electric brush for the price. It’s not noisy. It is as “loud” as you’d expect an electric toothbrush to be. The floss action actually does work. I do notice a difference when I floss afterwards, compared to using another brush brush. My teeth feel squeaky clean and happy! I don’t need to use any pressure at all with this brush. The timer function is cool too: at 2 minutes there are 4(?) short vibrations as a signal. Charging is convenient.
"
"
Just got it in the mail. Worked for a couple days but then wouldn't hold a charge. I did all the troubleshooting required (made sure outlet was working, charged for 22 hours etc...) but still wouldn't work. Then I was dumb and opened up the toothbrush because I thought I could replace the battery. I just voided the warranty instead...
"
"
Ordered two of these,items. One dles nor hold charge sending it back. Other so far okay. As for brushes. Really like them. Had Phillips sonic care prior to these, the oral b does much benter job. Would have given a 5 if both had worked properly. Will follow up re other one.
"
"
I used to use the regular toothbrushes, not really trust the electric toothbrush until I saw this deal.After trying it, I think it really provides a thorough, refreshing clean and my teeth truly feel better than before. It also comes with an extra head, which probably lasts 2 more months? The recharge pad and rechargeable battery also save me some money I believe.
"
"
I really like this battery operated tooth brush.  I never used one before because I was not really into so much electric tooth brushes. But one day I just thought why not just give it a try , now I think why I never used one before.  I really like the two minutes auto signal and the battery is so powerful, never runs out . You just need to put it on charge once for 8 hours in four to five days.This makes my morning and night brushing easy and fun. I really recommend this brand. If You people out there still thinking  to buy it don't think just buy it. You won't regret it.
"
"
I love it. I have lost my 5 years old oralB on Wednesday 39th of August 2018. I ordered this one on Thursday 30th August 2018 before midnight and I received it on 31 August 2018 at 3:00 pm. Can you hope any faster than this ???!!!I am amazed by the Prime privileges.I will keep Prime for sure.Thank you
"
"
This toothbrush does the job; it's very powerful but is still gentle on the gums.  Gets rid of those coffee stains - lol.  I've gifted this electric toothbrush to my daughter, my husband, my son and (of course!) to myself - hahaha.  Everybody loves this Oral B Vitality Toothbrush.
"
"
My dentists suggested I get a Oral B toothbrush back in the 90's I have been using one ever since. The last Oral B I had lasted for 8 years. It still charged but the bruising was not the same as when its new. I love this tooth brush, If you are thinking of buying one just buy it.
"
"
I definitely do not recommend this. There are no speeds and it’s so hard and fast that it feels like it’s going to rip your teeth out. Worst electric toothbrush I’ve ever owned. You get what you pay for - avoid this one.
"
"
I used it about 6 times altogether!  I noticed from the start that it seemed to be running slow.  On the 7th time I tried to use it, it stopped altogether.  I had it plugged in the entire time.  I guess you only get what you paid for.  But in this case, I got NOTHING.
"
"
We bought them for our kids.  We were getting sick of the batteries with the children's electric toothbrushes.  However, the charge life is not that great and the tooth brush does not stop after 2 minutes, which gets confusing for the kids.
"
"
Performs much better than my previous Arm & Hammer Spinbrush.  I like the timer feature that pulses when you have hit the two minute mark for brushing.  The charge lasts at least 6 days for me, brushing twice a day.  I like the fact that when the battery does run out, it is still at full brushing power; it doesn't slowly get less and less powerful as the battery drains.  Very happy.  Official brush heads for this product are a bit pricy.
"
"
Cela faisait longtemps que je voulais une brosse à dent électrique. Je pensais que c'était cher. En fait, oui il y en a des dispendieuse, mais celle-ci est abordable et fait très bien le travail. Je ne passerai jamais plus d'une brosse à dents électrique, surtout à ce prix.
"
"
I absolutely love this electric toothbrush!!It is very powerful and it cleans my teeth so well I get compliments from my dentist that my teeth and gums look great!!Its also very easy to find replacement heads for this brand and model.You cant beat the price as well.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush at a good price. My dentist recommended this brand. Has a timer when you're done (2 mins) and charge stays about five days without charger (but I usually leave it plugged in consistently when I am home). Overall happy with purchase!
"
"
Overall good product. The brush heads it cameWith are a little too strong for my teeth, and the power should be lowered just a little as any moment I take it out of my Mouth it splashed everywhere. The timer button is also very hard to press and only works a handful of times. Might try with other brush heads and see if the strength is tolerable.
"
"
First time I have electric toothbrush, so it's hard for me to compare to other product on the market.  But I really like it, it seems to be sturdy.  I'm always a bit scared on how long the battery will last.  But I didn't noticed too many bad comment on that.
"
"
I've had a couple of these now.  They have lasted a long time, and work well.  My gums were receding from brushing too hard with a manual toothbrush.  They have not gotten any worse since I started using one of these.  My only complaint is that the handle and base can be hard to clean.  I rinse the handle thoroughly each time I use it, but the rubber part still gets stained.
"
"
Conforme a la description !!  Brosse  dent de qualité, minuteur intégré pour nous signifier que nous avons brosser nos dent! elle,rend les dent bien propre! Merci
"
"
The main reason why i am giving it such a low rating is because it just stop working after 3 weeks. There is no indicator if the product is charging or needs to be charged. The brush it self is a little smaller the a thought but that was no issue. Also it does come with a built in 2 mintue timer , so you know when to stop , that was a plus.  Very simple product ,easy to use.
"
"
This is really inexpensive and effective for what it costs. I like the two minute timer feature that makes sure I brush my teeth for at least two minutes, because I'm bad at timing myself. The battery tends to last me about a week, so it doesn't require constant charging (and you can usually tell when it needs a charge because of the speed it is brushing at)
"
"
Well this is the first electric toothbrush I've ever used in my life. It takes some time to get used to it that's for sure. After I did I found it does a good job. Teeth feel cleaner after using it. Am glad my dentist recommended it to me.
"
"
Marche a merveille ! dure en moyenne 3 ans avant que la batterie lâche ou la partie du chargeur, mais sachez que cela n'est pas une raison de ne pas l'acheter !
"
"
I don't utilize the  timer function, so no comment there. I utilize the tooth brush aprox 3 minutes at atime so have seen no degradation in battery,...but do not run it long enough to feel comfortable commenting on battery life.In comparison to brick and mortar stores I found the Oral-B Vitality Floss Action Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush to be of great value.
"
"
In 2017 I bought a replacement Oral B toothbrush for $18.00 that was identical to my old broken one. When I needed to replace another one I bought this Oral B Vitality model for $25. It kind of sucks compared to the original. It feels lighter and cheaper and it runs at a lower  (single) speed. It also lacks a charging LED.If I had thought of it in time I would have returned it.
"
"
The is the second of these toothbrushes that I've had. The first lasted 11 years, although the battery began to die after about 8 years. For a while I could still get a good charge by running it down completely before recharging. I would have replaced it sooner if I'd known they were this inexpensive!
"
"
I've been using the Oral-B electric toothbrush for a month now and it seems to do a great job. I know I brush for a full 2 min now because it has a timer. I leave it in the charging stand so it's always fully charged.
"
"
This brush is ok. You definitely need to learn to hold it with 2 fingers and the gentleness of a baby. It is a hardcore vibration device. It gets my teeth clean although I'm a bit concerned about long-term enamel damage. This isn't a slanted review, this device is seriously powerful. You could chip your teeth if your not careful.
"
"
C'est mon deuxième achat de ce type de brosse à dent et toujours très satisfait !Petit bémol : la photo sur Amazon diffère de l'objet reçu.  Sur la photo il y du bleu et la brosse reçu est totalement blanche.
"
"
very good thootbrush. batery last a long time and fast to charge. the brissels on the head cleans really well between teeths. i recommend this to anyone who is looking for an electric toothbrush. very cost effective.
"
"
I have used these products for years excellent productJust back from dentist, very impressed with clean teeth, I have 32 excellent teeth!!NOTE: I am 76 years old
"
"
Replacement unit for my parents.  My unit is too powerful for their teeth.  So far after several days, they enjoy using it.  The life cycle is improving which is a plus.
"
"
The best toothbrush I can invest in not to pricey and it does the job. My mouth feel so clean like I go to the dentist every day. It is easy to use and control. I love it.
"
"
I bought this brush to replace an older version of a Vitality and this one is way better.  It keeps the charge several days and has a nice strong spin.  I'm never going back to manual brushing.
"
"
I love my new brush and the 2 minute timer really helps to focus on the job at hand.No complaints - it was well worth every penny but it was on sale so it intrigued me.
"
"
Stopped buying the toothbrushes that take replaceable batteries and start to slow down after a week. This is convenient and different heads are simple to order
"
"
Have been using this for over 2 months now & I must say I am more than satisfied with this toothbrush.Charging works as intended .Timer helps me make sure I brush full cycle.Good for the price as they also bundle an extra head with it.Would have been great if they could bundle a travel case but maybe I am just being greedy.
"
"
After just over one month of using this toothbrush it stopped working properly. At full battery charge it would not turn on immediately, however after waiting 10-20 seconds after pushing the button it would start working. This lasted a few days after which it simply would no longer turn on. I was replacing an older version of this toothbrush model which worked flawlessly for years, and was disappointed by this model.
"
"
Everything is fine about this toothbrush except fluid drips down your arm while you're brushing!!!!! It may not seem like that big of a deal but when you're brushing your teeth 2+ times a day, it's extremely infuriating.I switched to the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and it's much better.
"
"
I am really pleased with this product. It works very well and it’s slim design takes up virtually no space on our counter. I took it out of town for three days without the charger, and it never lost its power. I definitely recommend and would buy again.
"
"
Dentist recommended. Was told this was as good as more expensive models. Have received great results. Much better than manual brushing.
"
"
This one supposed to be for me. But my toddler son liked it too. We end up sharing ( with different / separate head of course ). Will be buying more replacement head or buy one for my son so i dont have to change the head everytime we use :)
"
"
it is working good so far.it runs a lot longer on a charge than the oral b electric toothbrushes that I have used for several years,but that is probably normal for a toothbrush that has been recharged many times over the years.i have had very good success with oral b electric toothbrushes over the years,so I trust this one will be the same.
"
"
Love this brush so far!  I can't imagine any bad reviews on this one.  Not powerful brush head, just right.  Nice to handle.  All around, really nice;))
"
"
Oral-B have wonderful product, but no info about the timer on the owners little book, and did not seems to works since i brush my toot more that 3 minutes with it. Overall, great product, very satisfied.
"
"
Toothbrush works great. No complaints. But you are to replace the brush every three months. You can buy a new toothbrush for the cost of the replacement heads. I would not recomment this toothbrush. There are brushes out there that are just as good but have affordable replacement brushes.
"
"
Cleans very well and works like a charm. Highly recommended. No need to spend on much more expensive brush, this one works pretty well.
"
"
This is my 3rd Oral B electric toothbrush--I replace the unit every 3  years, so that means I've been using them for quite a few years. During this time all I have to do is occasionally replace the heads. Batteries do eventually run out--but that takes several years. My teeth are great--and my husband has spent far more on traditional toothbrushes over these years.
"
"
Bought 2. Great toothbrush, teeth feel really clean. Battery holds charge for few days, only problem is you can feel the strength of the battery depleting, the best brush is when it's freshly charged and then after a bit it gets weaker. Wish it held consistent power and then just died rather than getting weaker. Not a big issue, just going to charge it more frequently but the clean feel is miles away from a manual brush, definitely worth the switch
"
"
Absolute garbage.  Do not buy.  I have had 3 oral B electric toothbrushes in the past and this is the first one I have had problems with, it just hums when I press the on button and has absolutely no battery power even when I do eventually manage to occasionally get it to work.  Garbage product.
"
"
This is the worst toothbrush I have ever used. It feels like rubbing your teeth with a grinder. I find it hard to believe it’s oral B. Don’t waste your money.
"
"
It was a good broke after the 35 time using I only had too charge it once but as soon as I go too take the head of it off and on the toothbrush never turned back on now I'm stuck with an extra large regular toothbrush lol. Otherwise worked great
"
"
Brought this for my son. I have one myself and love it.  I find it works great and my teeth feel so clean.  Love this item and I know my son will too!
"
"
I love my toothbrush now but at the beginning it was too hard on my gums. The timer unsure it’s function haven’t read up too much on it.
"
"
I love it. It feels cleaner now that i am using it. The brush is soft and the rubber part of it really helps massage my gum. My gum bleeding has stoooed since. Didn't charge yet after a month using it.
"
"
The brush just stopped charging in 4 months...tried different plug points but does not work and is outside the return window so money gone.
"
"
I like the toothbrush at first it would only last like 1 minute but I realized it wasn't fully charged lol!but yea overall great toothbrush & the thing about Oral B is that you can order any toothbrush head for your brush which is great too...so for all the people who find that this brush head is too rough on their teeth/gums you can buy separate ""oral b sensitive replacement heads""
"
"
Having never used an electric toothbrush before, I was truly amazed with the difference in the results.  My husband also bought one  and he  is also pleased with his. It really gets the job done and the price is great. Will purchase again
"
"
Great little tooth brush at a great price. Teeth feel real ckean after use and the head can get in between your teeth so you can miss flossing now and then.
"
"
Handle perpetually stinks.  I wash my hands before use, wash the handle after use and it still stinks.  I replaced a battery powered Oral-B with this and I'm glad I kept it because this thing is going in the garbage.  What a waste of money.
"
"
I ordered this product for my girlfriend and she likes it very much. She says, it cleans her teeth better than any other toothbrush she's had. Highly recommend!
"
"
It’s only three months old and it’s not holding its charge for more than a day ,  I should say this has not been my experience with past purchases of the same product.  Would appreciate a replacement!
"
"
Arrived after only one weekWorks great. Oral-B have great products. The first Oral-B i bought 13 years ago still works fine. Only needs to change brushes.My wife wanted this new one becauise she do not want to switch brush every morning and evening.
"
"
Really like it, wished the battery was a little longer lasting. But for the price couldn’t beat it!
"
"
A little disappointed.  I had an electric tooth brush before but it was another Braun model and it had two speeds.  Miss this on the brush I purchased and end up with tooth past all over the walls and sink.
"
"
Very strong brushing action with a rectangular head. I have generic round replacement heads that work as well.
"
"
Great toothbrush. This replaced a Vitality I've been using for 5+ years which gave up on charging - both battery life and finally the charger. Hope this one lasts as long as the previous one.
"
"
This toothbrush Is boss. Received it recently, charged for 16 hours as per instructions. It’s super strong and wow what a good price. I can compare it to a $200 spin brush.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
"
"
I waited 2 months for the review. Still works great. One charge can last 4-5 days. Had good results per dental hygienist. Noticeably less tartar. You still have to floss though.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush and I must say that it's amazing. You get the post dentist cleaning feeling every time.The two minute timer is really convenient, the battery lasts for quite a while and it's very easy to clean.
"
"
Had a great checkup, and both my hygienist and dentist remarked on the difference it. Add to my teeth and gums.  Love the clean feeling!
"
"
Beats your regular toothbrush, hands down! Now my teeth always feel squeaky clean. So easy to clean and I love how it has a built-in timer mechanism. When fully charged it lasts a week of twice daily brushing.
"
"
Much better than expected, in fact, if you had already purchased an expensive electric one and got this one for travelling.. Then you might feel slim to none difference.. Except that.. I shouldn't have paid that much for the one at home..
"
"
Pretty good and good price. The only thing it's I got so exited for nothing when I saw the 10$ coupon but they send you a expire coupon.
"
"
The toothbrush is good but I wanted to buy another one for a family member and now apparently its only for prime members which is sort of dumb as I can't afford the monthly rate of prime for a toothbrush.
"
"
The Oral-B Vitality Floss-Action Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush is as advertised. Lots of power, holds a charge well and does a bloody great job. Teeth feel great.The item was delivered quickly and is excellent value for the price..
"
"
Bought for the wife and I.  Our first venture into an electric brush.The reviews are true.  Teeth are much cleaner.  Very happy with the purchase.
"
"
My newly bought electric toothbrush only lasts 6 cycles. It seems too short. I had another Oral-B Vitality from a year ago and that one lasts at least 14 cycles. Not sure if I got one with poor battery or if the battery capacity has been decreased.
"
"
excellent. my wife and i been using  ours past 6 or 7 months. still work  like new.  the brush head was not very good. soon after  few months some of the fibers were coming off.
"
"
My original rechargeable Braun gave out after 20 years of use. Loved it. This is a great replacement. Teeth feel clean after brushing!
"
"
I gifted my husband and my nephew for Christmas. They are happy with the toothbrushes rechargeable.
"
"
C'est quoi la la joke ?une brosse à dents c'est pour se brosser les dents 🤣
"
"
Loving it!Wish it came with a travel case is all.Ordered one more for my kiddo.
"
"
Good for the price. although it does not have a light to tell you the battery level or anything like that instead it just get less and less powerful until it dies. Definitely worth it for the price though
"
"
Love this toothbrush. It’s my second one! I’d recommend it for sure. Holds a good charge and easy to change the brush. Love it! Thanks : )
"
"
Does what it says on the tin. It’s an electric toothbrush, it may not be the best version out there, but it’s still going to clean better than a regular toothbrush!
"
"
Just replaced with the same old model. Vibrates mouth a little, just as well i replace old one, cleans a lot better.
"
"
I got this to replace an old electric Brush by Oral-B and this one is lighter and is only one speed but it does an excellent job and I love it
"
"
Simple to use and excellent value. Holds charge well and functions perfectly.
"
"
Works as expected.  This was a very reasonably priced rechargeable toothbrush.  No bells and whistles, but who needs them on a toothbrush?
"
"
j'adore cette brosse et la possibilité de varier les  brossettes au gout.
"
"
Je suis très satisfait de la durabilité des deux appareils précédent du même type et de la même marque qui ont duré chacun 10 ans.Modèles de base qui font le travail pour lequel il sont conçu.Les brosses génériques(moins hi-tech) fonctionnent aussi très bien.
"
"
The dentist was disappointed to find all my teeth pain went away.  Plus I would rub on the sensitive toothpaste, after burshing, for a few minutes.  If you don't pull off the brush each time and rinse, a stinky film collects inside the piston.
"
"
This is my second one over the past few years.  Haven't needed to use it yet as old one is still working, just got it as a back up as my other one is a few years old and the on off switch is getting worn out.
"
"
my son wanted this just that it has to be charged alllthe time
"
"
My husband loved it ! great product. I have one for myself. Highly recommend.
"
"
Love this product, although it is a little rough on the teeth, you get a nice set of coupons and an extra toothbrush head with it too which is nice.
"
"
Found out that my old Braun 3D excel was no longer working because its associated charger was not charging. Old tooth brush is now working great with the charger received with the new one which is much more compact than the old one.
"
"
Not worth it. Was gift and it stopped working first week. Better to add $ and get better one
"
"
Pretty good. The battery life isn't too short, one charge lasts a couple of days. Only problem is, it doesn't give notice when battery is low. It will fall dead halfway while brushing my teeth.
"
"
Second one I have ordered.  Would highly recommend as it is great quailty.
"
"
rattles teeth initially but works great once you get used to it
"
"
Very nice toothbrush for the price. Spins as fast as the more expensive versions. Teeth feel very clean after use and gives a nice gum massage.
"
"
Keeps my teeth and gums fresh and stimulated! Love the timer thingy!
"
"
Works well, and timer useful. Would be even better if there were a charging indicator.

Great should have purchased this électrique toothbrush years ago
"
"
Toothbrush ceased to work after only 3 brushings.  This was a replacement toothbrush.  The first one also ceased to work after only several brushings.  May have something to do with the stutter notice indicating 2 minutes of brushing.  Will not be re-ordering.
"
"
Excellent rapport qualité prix. Brossage efficace.
"
"
Good one, actually very good for the price , better ones are available but very costly. This one does the job pretty well.
"
"
Good cheap electric toothbrush brush. Its cheap, it works. Bought this to replace the one I've had for a long time when I left it on a trip. Have and would purchase again.
"
"
Works great and does job, don't need to be $100+ tooth brush
"
"
The one I received is white so it’s different than the photo.. but I love it so much more! It looks great in the bathroom now and it works great as usual.
"
"
Livraison rapide. Facilité le brossage des dents
"
"
I love this product works great and lasts long, my previous one lasted 7 yrs! Highly recommend
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. It suits me well. It cleaned my teeth better than ever before.For its cheap price (comparing to other brands), highly recommend it to anyone who never tries the electric toothbrush.
"
"
I've only had this for a few days. The battery won't last long enough for it to brush for 2 minutes. It just dies half way.
"
"
Excellent product and will reorder when we need another one.
"
"
Oval happed rotary brush strikes teeth a lot.
"
"
My teeth don't feel any cleaner than with my a manual brush, in fact, quite the opposite. Also can't get used to the intense vibration in my teeth and head. Wish I could've returned it.
"
"
Great product! Still running and battery still holds the charge. I will buy this again.
"
"
Got it for my husband for Christmas and he likes it. Comes with two brush heads, replaceable and its rechargeable. No complaints from my husband. Great value.
"
"
Wish I knew about how amazing this electric toothbrush was sooner! Love that it has a timer. Excellent product! Loved it so much that my boyfriend also purchased one.
"
"
Been using for a couple months now and love it. Made me wonder why I never got an electric before! The timer function is super useful.
"
"
We purchased two Oral-B brushes about 5 years ago and use them daily. They still work as well as when first purchased. We purchased two more about a year ago but haven't used them because our original purchases are still excellent.
"
"
Works, timed the timer 1:30 approximately. Not enough time to do thorough job. Returning, waited 2 months, really disappointed.
"
"
I’ve used these brushes for a long time....they work awesome and my dentist loves the results
"
"
Same as my last one. But with better brush heads.
"
"
Love this electric toothbrush!  My teeth feels so clean and now my gums are faring better.
"
"
Really happy with this brush. Bought as a secondary for travel. My original is about 10 years old and still works perfect.
"
"
My kids each got one for Christmas and so far they work great! No issues, they also came with a spare brush head!!
"
"
Good value for the money wife likes it
"
"
brush head is hard at first, but after a couple uses it is fine. if you are extra sensitive, consider buying some interchangeable heads for sensitive gums/teeth first.
"
"
Love this! Should have got one years ago
"
"
Does well what it is supposed to do!Buy this if you just wanna clean your teeth and don’t wanna spend your money on fancy stuff.
"
"
I bought this for my wife, she never felt the need to use an electric brush. I just left it on her side of the sink she uses it everyday. It works well and it was a great price
"
"
Love this brush. All you need is a basic model and this is it!
"
"
Old model shipped. Not the same toothbrush shown. Coupons inside expired July 2018. Toothbrush is great but I don't appreciate seller getting rid of old stock on my dime .
"
"
I had this brand years ago, and for me Braun is number one product when it comes to washing teeth.
"
"
it does cleans better than a normal brush but I feel like I'm drilling my teeth and gums. after 1 week of use I'm getting use or the batteries are not that strong now.
"
"
Great product. Using it for many years and buying it again for replacement
"
"
Ma première brosse électrique. Je suis très satisfaite. Brossage de toute évidence plus efficace que la brosse traditionnelle.
"
"
Really good one but unhaopy because before the picture showed it was all white for adults and blue for kidsBut the one i received is not all white
"
"
Been using it for 6 months now and no issues. Cleans teeth well and a full charge lasts about a week if you brush twice a day. No complaints.
"
"
Got a lemon
"
"
Bonne qualité pour le prix.
"
"
Very nice cleaning job. Use it daily . Has made a difference.
"
"
My kids love these tooth brushes... they were suggested by the orthodontist and work great
"
"
The longer bristles on the outside of the head  did a great job cleaning down to the gums.
"
"
Fonctionne parfaitement !
"
"
Perfect! Don't know how I lasted so long without it. The charge last for days which is great for me.
"
"
I love this toothbrush! It is great for a first electric brush if you want to experiment and try it.
"
"
This replaces my old tooth brush, same make, If I wouldn't like it, I certainly would not have stayed with the same make.
"
"
Good product for the price
"
"
Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He has been wanting an automatic toothbrush. He loves it! Brushes his teeth more often because he likes it so much. Great buy!
"
"
I like that you can do without charging battery for a few days
"
"
Decent toothbrush. Too ""rough"" or vigorous brushing for some people but I like it. Unfortunately the coupon that came with it was already expired (months before I purchased it).
"
"
Simple and does the work as expected. Pretty happy with the purchase. Haven't figured out the timer function yet but honestly not a big deal for me.
"
"
Good brand price good
"
"
2nd set of this type Oral B purchased we have purchased. Lasted 6+ years and cleans far better/easier than a manual brush. Best value I have found for electric tooth brush.
"
"
Inexpensive and works well
"
"
Purchased during a sale. My first electric brush and I like it a lot!
"
"
Love it. Best toothbrush I’ve had yet
"
"
Worked well for a few months then no longer held its charge
"
"
Great purchase and good product
"
"
Excellent product!
"
"
Très efficace elle aide à éliminer le tartre
"
"
Awesome toothbrush. Works great.
"
"
The vibrations are a bit to strong for me, but husband likes it so this goes to him. I ordered the sensitive version and likes it so far. One thing that could be better is if there is a indicator light for charging.
"
"
A favourite brand. Excellent product.
"
"
Recommended. Good quality. With one extra head.Update: I've been using it for a year now and I have no complain. Works perfectly.
"
"
I like the toothbrush. For the money seems like a good deal!
"
"
Oral B keeps the premium quality products at great price.
"
"
For the price it's an awesome electric toothbrush! My online complaint would be the vibration is a little aggressive but it doesn't bother me
"
"
Bought his as a gift for my husband. Unfortunately he only got 2 months of usage out of it before it stopped working. Don't waste your money.
"
"
Oral B products are always great
"
"
Great electric toothbrush
"
"
Works great. Would be better if there was a travel cover, it would prevent the bristles from becoming bent over.
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Acheté  pour mon fils cadeau
"
"
The brush provides a really rigorous and precise clean.  It comes with an automatic two-minute timer built in to help keep track of how long you have been brushing your teeth. It serves as a great motivator to keep brushing a few seconds longer, especially during groggy mornings.
"
"
Love it ! Plus it came right on time .
"
"
Facile d’utilisation avec les enfants, toute la famille aime.
"
"
Great idea, makes you brush longer and feels like it does make a difference.  Rechargeable and easy to charge/use.  Good Value!
"
"
Bonne achat
"
"
DO NOT buy if you don't wanna have to buy a whole new toothbrush two months later. Mine lasted about 8 weeks and it's completely dead. Won't charge or anything anymore
"
"
Good price
"
"
As good as more expensive models
"
"
Solid product for the money
"
"
Using this electric brush for 3 years. It is really amazing how it can clean your teeth.Bought this one as a gift for a friend.
"
"
I find the brush is not very powerful and the battery needs to be constantly charging to get a decent charge. Not great to be honest.
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Aide vraiment à avoir une bonne hygiène dentaire !
"
"
Wish you could get the toothbrush without the charger. I’ve got an extra charger now that I’m never going to use.
"
"
Fantastic brush our whole family uses with different heads
"
"
I love it!
"
"
The vitality has a great motor power leaving your mouth feeling very clean after use. The inbuilt time is very handy to remind you to keep brushing for 2 minutes.
"
"
As expected  it a bit bulky
"
"
Works perfectly : great lifetime battery, great minuting fonction and great aspect. I own this since 2017 and it still works perfectly !
"
"
Bon instrument mais pas de chrono aux 30 secondes.
"
"
My teeth feel so clean after!  I smoke, drink red wine, tea, and coffee and I no longer have the stain build up.
"
"
works good right now shouldn't ask for a review for 6 months
"
"
Best for your $
"
"
We bought 3 and 1 of them stopped working. Other 2 work great. Not sure if there is any warranty but I don't think so.
"
"
Bought this as a gift for my wife.  Have one myself.  We both use regularly.
"
"
Cleans my teeth
"
"
I like the brush bristles and how it feels on my teeth/gums. I like that it came with 2 brush heads. However it is noisier than other electric toothbrushes I’ve had before.
"
"
Good toothbrush。
"
"
effective
"
"
Great product! Purchased for my wife and she loves it. Hopefully she doesn't read the title of my review :)
"
"
Great
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush.  I like it very much. 😀
"
"
Perfect toothbrush fast shipping great price thank you amazon.
"
"
Does the job, no settings or extra functions except for a 2 minute timer that is built in and automatic. Overall great, bought another one for a family memeber.
"
"
Exactly as it was described
"
"
We bought this one first and liked it so much we ordered and second one!
"
"
Bon brossage
"
"
My teeth feel so clean. Floss action is great. My teeth are squeaky!
"
"
J'aime...
"
"
Love electric toothbrushes.My teeth feel so clean
"
"
just what I needed and works very well
"
"
Oral B know how to make a toothbrush.  You can buy a ton of different toothbrush heads, so this is a great value in my opinion..
"
"
Its a bit more aggressive than I expected it to be, and the opposite side of the brush is very inconvenient to maneuver. It is worth 15USD though.
"
"
First electric toothbrush. Very impressed with it.
"
"
Love it! Glad I purchased! Seems to do a much better job and my dentist agrees!!
"
"
Great brush
"
"
😁😁😁😁😊😊🤗🤩🤩🤩
"
"
I've had a couple of oral b's over the past years, all of them at the higher price range. I've had no issues with the toothbrush and the price is fantastic.I definitely recommend!
"
"
Love love love it shipping was extremely fast the product is great and the charger works perfect , overall 10/10 really great buy I bought one for me and my husband and he loves it .also at my local stores they were selling this tooth brush for more so it also saved me some money which I'm also happy about
"
"
Good upgrade from a manual brush. Product works well. Con: collects calcium at the base.
"
"
Shopping and product are just as described
"
"
Everything is as expected. Retail packaging, works just fine. Just keep in mind that it is not a lithium battery so don't charge it until it's empty.
"
"
Like the rotating motion and convenient size. Good value for $.I used the product to brush my teeth...and what else would I use it for??
"
"
Brushes teeth
"
"
Works well for the price. Very powerful. Would suggest the sensitive toothbrush head for sensitive gums.
"
"
For washing my teath.I am very happy this product.
"
"
The small recharging station is good and the toothbrush works well
"
"
It's great works well.
"
"
Does a great job. Good power and battery seems to never end
"
"
I recommend this product.
"
"
Teeth are whiter in a week
"
"
also cleans easily there's not much tooth paste build up. I think its a good unit and would buy it again.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Well worth the money
"
"
Good ergonomics, battery life and cost effective.
"
"
Works great, I love it
"
"
Stopped working after 4 uses
"
"
Product works much better than what I expect.  Feels solid in hand.
"
"
It's a great electric toothbrush. I've had it for about 2-3 months now, and it will be time to replace the head soon but that's fine because it came with an extra head :) great value. it works fabulous, I can feel my teeth are cleaner than with a manual brush. You don't even need to leave it plugged; just. Charge once overnight and the charge lasts like a month.
"
"
Great for the price. Works well and perfect for the first time purchasing electronic toothbrush. The timer of 2 minutes is really helpful in keeping track of time. It would be great to have a small light to show when it was being charged.
"
"
Good value and good quality
"
"
Its ok
"
"
its nice with two heads!
"
"
Same as one that retired. Charges easy. Works great
"
"
Brought a back up one for my son. He loves his toothbrush
"
"
We received the Oral-B Toothbrush on time & my wife is extremely pleased with the performance.We highly recommend this Rechargeable Toothbrush.
"
"
Easy to use, rechargeable
"
"
Works really well! I am still within my first month of use, but my gums seem to be tougher than before. Overall design is great.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush - I bought it for my son, and he loved it!
"
"
As headline
"
"
Work perfectly for 1/10 of the price of the other higher models.
"
"
Works great. Feel like you just had your teeth cleaned at the dentist. I like the small round brush head.
"
"
Great value and great intro to the electric toothbrush. Highly recommend.
"
"
I've had this for about six months and now the battery won't stay on for more than ten seconds.
"
"
title say it all
"
"
Excellent toothbrush for the young ones (9 and 11yo)
"
"
most highly rated by dentists. they must be paying the dentists!
"
"
Works as intended. I use it everyday and it is still running smooth.
"
"
Works great, I love that it is rechargeable.
"
"
bonjour,en avril 2018 J'ai acheté 2 brosses a dents électrique par contre j'en ai une qui ne fonctionne plus, je voulais savoir si elle est sous garantie encore.merci
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent très bien rien à dire de mal
"
"
Very good for the price although I wish it had a charging light to let you know when it is charged and discharged. I would have preferred that they kept the same bottom shape of the more expensive models
"
"
Pleased
"
"
Great value
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price! First time using the electric and I like it. Cleans very well.
"
"
Ok
"
"
husband loves it but brush too small and he is not too keen on the charge even tho it says ok to leave on the charger!!!
"
"
Work's
"
"
We have only used the toothbrush for a short time but like it very much Carl & Brenda.
"
"
Best 20 bucks I've ever spent. Lasts a long time on a single charge and the head was easy to replace.
"
"
I love this toothbrush, my teeth feel like pearls, and it holds a charge for 4 days. I will but another when this one wears out.
"
"
Bon produit
"
"
Very good
"
"
love it. works great.
"
"
Excellent product. Good unit for you teeth
"
"
Works well
"
"
Have been very satisfied with this product. .... and so is my dentist!!It's easy to use, although does not come with specific instructions, such as HOW to brush.Charge lasts about one week for one person. This item does not have a charge indicator light, but I didn't miss that.
"
"
Great for my kids, even when they are lazy brushes Oral B gives a better brush than a regular toothbrush would.
"
"
excellent
"
"
Great toothbrush.  We will keep with these.
"
"
Excellent brand and feels amazing!
"
"
Works great just like an Oral-B should. Arrived on time and same price as at store came with charger and 2 brushes. All good
"
"
It’s not my first one but it works as expected so I’m happy with it.
"
"
Love this brush it works well and charges quickly
"
"
Works well.
"
"
This toothbrush made my teeth and gums hurts after one use- I recommend spending more money to get the higher rated electric toothbrush.
"
"
Finallly got a replacement after 9 years of use! Works well, durable, long life.
"
"
Inexpensive, effective and dependable
"
"
Good
"
"
excellent, ma copine adore ça, très bon brossage et bonne qualité merci
"
"
Very good
"
"
Was using Philips Soniccare and found Oral B to be a nicer refreshing tooth brush.
"
"
I purchased this one as my previous one had given up the ghost after 18 years. I can only hope for the same longevity on the one I just purchased
"
"
Fonctionne parfaitement et abordable.
"
"
Comme la description ;)
"
"
It works very WELL.  My teeth feel much cleaner then when I use a manual  toothbrush.
"
"
This is the best bang for your buck!
"
"
Great brush. My son uses it daily and enjoys it.
"
"
Very happy with this toothbrush.
"
"
and functional
"
"
Fantastic this is to replace my old one i’ve Had for 10 years
"
"
Very satisfied!
"
"
Works amazing! Great toothbrush
"
"
perfect for a single user..a brush head, toothbrush and charger are all included in the package
"
"
It seems fine ... worth the purchase.  I had battery powered one I liked better though.
"
"
5 star
"
"
Très bien. Peu cher, simple et efficace.Very good and simple. Perfect.
"
"
I really love it! It’s great
"
"
Met expectations
"
"
This tooth brush is just like the more expensive version. It was a timely delivery and I am happy with the product.
"
"
Does what it’s meant to
"
"
Si les batteries durent longtemps (5 ans minimum), se sera un produit parfait.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Very solid and as expected.
"
"
Je suis très dessus je nais pas reçu le bon produit
"
"
It was exactly what I was expecting. I received the toothbrush with two heads and charger.
"
"
this is a great electric toothbrush. After just one use, it feels like a cleaning done at the dentist
"
"
Solide et facile a recharger
"
"
Works as described, no frills electric tooth brush.No complaints and worth the price.
"
"
Exactly what I wanted and does a great job!
"
"
Love it
"
"
Very good unit perhaps even better than older Braun models which had a price 4 times greater.  On par with Sonic.
"
"
👍
"
"
worth the money and very good thank you
"
"
Works great
"
"
The toothbrush that arrived is not the one picture - which is the sole reason I ordered it sooooooooo
"
"
I really like this toothbrush!
"
"
Excellent product
"
"
Work very well, do what it's supposed to do.
"
"
Pour la 2e salle de bain
"
"
Im mister Clean teeth now!
"
"
Cleans really well without being too hard on the gums
"
"
Great product
"
"
It's a toothbrush.
"
"
Handle fine: floss far too hard it blocks the brushes
"
"
This is great. Stays charged for a couple of weeks.
"
"
Love the toothbrush, teeth feels so clean it's just like getting out of the dentist office.
"
"
Perfect the same I did have before  it works very well but the only thing make a funny noise but is ok
"
"
I love the clean feeling it leavesStays charged a long time
"
"
Product worked at first and then completely died. Never got the base wet and always kept it clean. Useless
"
"
Great purchase. Still working years later. Just make sure you swap out brush heads.
"
"
excellent quality
"
"
3 brush heads or 2 and a brush for same price? I think I take the second choice.
"
"
Good basic toothbrush, but the ""floss action"" head is not good. It feels like it is actually damaging your gums. I had to buy a different head. The price was reasonable, but I found it about 20% lower in a local drug store.
"
"
Perfect!
"
"
Bonjour , Je ne peux évaluer le produit car je l'offre en cadeau a Noel .Au plaisir
"
"
Amazing product will buy again

Powerful brushing, long lasting battery
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned! I wear braces and it takes a lot of dirt off my teeth.
"
"
Works great
"
"
I've used this for years. Easy to hold for people with hand and finger problems.
"
"
Broke after using it 4 times, contacted Oral B and they promptly sent me out a replacement
"
"
Oral B makes great toothbrushes. Love the two minute timer.
"
"
Great value. No need to spend $100 plus on an electric toothbrush
"
"
Product is perfect and delivery was on time.
"
"
Really does the job as advertised and sitting on the chargeable base keeps it always ready.
"
"
Just one word, perfect.

"
"
Bon rapport qualité prix
"
"
Parfaite
"
"
This tooth brush was just what I was looking for.It met all my expectations - light weight, small head,soft bristle.
"
"
I enjoy the brush. One disadvantage is the cord being in the way if your vanity too is not large.
"
"
This toothbrush works very well.Gives a very deep clean feeling to your mouth.Much much better than a regular toothbrush.Great!
"
"
Love them worth the price...
"

Good price, fits exactly as intended to described toothbrush
"

Works good, no trouble so far. Battery lasts a few days for sure
"
"
We bought three sets for three of us. They are gentle but cleaned very well. We love them very much and nobody would use the old ones again.😀😀😀
"
"
Great brush, battery better than advertised.
"
"
i would never use another brand
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush

Toothbrush works great! Great value.

The product works great! Worth the money for the price
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush for the price.
"
"
Xmas gift have to wait a month

"
So much better than a regular toothbrush. Teeth feel clean after one use.
"
"
Super little machine😊
"

Excellent value for the money so far. I had a much more expensive oral b electric toothbrush before this, and really liked it. I did not want to pay as much for the replacement, and was delighted to find one that I liked at a more reasonable price. Besides that, it actually is more powerful, and I like the floss action. Being able to use different heads is a bonus. I had 3 left from my previous one and they fit this one. I think if someone had sensitive gums beyond minor sensitivity, they would need to use another tip at first as the floss action is more aggressive, and bigger. Overall I love it so far.
"
"
Oh my god. Used this for the first time right now, and it tore my mouth up. Who knew somebody could get so much vibration from something so small? It hurt when I first used it, but I got used to it after a while. It really feels like 9/10 dentists have tried it before. I'm still tingling. 10/10 Buy, don't rent.
"
"
I haven't been to the dentist in close to fifteen years. Part of the reason is because I used to work at a dentist office and they're kind of a scam. I say ""kind of"" because they're not actually out to scam you like a con man would but the whole ""dentistry"" system is designed for fat cash. Like if there is something that looks like it might need something done to it; they're going to do that thing no matter how much it costs. ""On the x-ray it kind of sort of looks like you might need a super duper expensive root canal so we're going to go ahead and do it."" It's quite possible you needed that root canal but you probably didn't and could live a happy productive life without ever getting that root canal done. It's like that. Like if you eat some crusty bread before going to the dentist and the crust scratches your gums a little so there's like a hint of blood in your mouth, the dentist is going to recommend a whole skin graft procedure for your gums. So anyway this toothbrush: For $20 this thing unbelievable. Use it all the time and you won't need to go to the dentist ever. Take it from some guy that used to work in the file room of a dentists office.
"

After four months of use;Awesome brush. Circle shaped head is easy to maneuver around all my teeth, even my back molars. The battery lasts at least a week, easily, before it needs recharging. This is with at least twice a day brushing, sometimes three. It came with a replacement head, so you get 6 months worth of brushing teeth(three months per head). Fit and finish is excellent too, no complaints. Charging base is small and well designed. My only qualm is no travel case. Other than that it is a great product for the price.
"
"
Teeth feel amazing and super clean!!! I Highly recommend this!!  I have told some friend and they have also purchased it. Incredible price too. Thanks Oral B!!
"
"
Great brush for the price. If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles you should look elsewhere but this is a great brush for the money. I previously had one that had a pressure sensor to turn off if you pushed too hard against your teeth but that is far from a necessary feature of a toothbrush. I am quite happy with this one so far.
"
"
this is the third one that we bought. It suppose to come with a SAVING of 10$ in Canada if you register the product...but when we register, there is NO CANADA to click on..so no rebate for Canadian...the previous buy did also the same thing..10$ rebate,,,but not working..i don't like these FALSE advertisingAnyway the toothbrush work very well.
"
"
Been using it for several months now and the toothbrush has worked great. Feels a lot better than using a regular toothbrush, but without all the worrying of spots you might have missed while brushing. Battery life is great, you just need to remember to recharge it once in four or so days, which you can leave overnight on the charging stand.
"
"
I've had this toothbrush since November and has been working great until 2 weeks ago. The toothbrush will only stay on for 30 seconds at a time. At first I thought it may be because it wasn't charged enough (though I leave it plugged over night) so I thought I'd wait it out and see if charging it 24/7 would bring it back. It still does not work like it used to. Will have to buy a new toothbrush, but will go with one that will hopefully last me more than just a couple of months.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. I had oral surgery and the brushes are gentle enough not to irritate the area but still work properly to leave my teeth feeling clean and looking great.  Holds a charge well - only needs recharging every 12-14 days or so with daily use.  Fantastic toothbrush and you can't beat the price.
"
"
It's very very tough brush, and it can be damaging for your gum & your teeth.Maybe if you use a VERY light brush and you're careful you might be able to get away with it.. but for me, it just wasn't good at all.I had my gums in pain for almost a week after using this toothbrush.I don't recommend it.
"
"
Very satisfyd
"
"
Left over features of my original ""oral b""  brush were interchangeable with the new flosser,Wall mounted charger plus the brush heads making the new device an acceptable second brush.

This is an exceptional toothbrush for the price. My old Oral B Sonic Complete toothbrush started giving up on me after 8 years. I could have ordered replacement batteries but it would have cost the same as this Oral B Vitality when on sale.The Vitality is fairly different from my old brush. The first noticeable difference is size. The handle on the Vitality is thicker than the Sonic Complete which I originally interpreted as cheap. Of course after two weeks of use I've become accustomed to the size and don't think twice about it.The second difference is its oscillation strength. The Vitality is much more abrasive than my old brush. Where as the Sonic Complete gave a gentle vibration this brush is aggressive. I've had to change how I brush - I let the brush do all the work and simply hold on the brush in place. My teeth do feel cleaner than before.I don't find it cleans my tongue as well but it likely has to do with the brush heads. There are several head options available and I'll be trying something like the Dual Action head to see how it cleans my tongue.I don't miss the charging light or brush settings. I only used the first brush setting and didn't give the charging light any attention on my old brush.There is one thing I didn't like. The package is almost dangerous to remove. The package is sealed on all four sides PLUS the hanging hole. I recommend using a very sharp knife or scissors to open the package - with extreme caution of course. Cut the bottom and two sides and open upward. The sealed hanging hole makes it hard to open from the top down.
"
"
I have expected great quality from oral b. Battery life is to less, and there is no indication of battery level. Better stay away.
"
"
This is the first electric toothbrush I have bought. Maybe it's me but I couldn't use it properly. I am going back to my regular toothbrush. My suggestion is, if you are happy with your manual toothbrush, don't waste your money on this.
"
"
I loved the performance of this toothbrush but despite daily cleaning the buildup of mold in the brush head was disgusting and very hard to remove. I tossed it.
"
"
I purchased this for my husband for Christmas, and also received one from my wish list.  Noticed that the power started to get low a few days ago and my husband's and now mine barely comes on. I bought this based on all the good reviews, but within less than three weeks, both of them are duds.
"
"
I usually don't post reviews but seriously guys - this toothbrush is amazing!This is the first long-term electric toothbrush I've owned and I'm so glad I bought it. My teeth feel insanely clean after I brush my teeth - kind of like when you step right out of the dentist.I'm actually excited about brushing my teeth now lol. Which is usually the part of my routine I dread the most. But not with this brush!
"
"
Works great. I charged it once since it got delivered. Still working. Good battery life
"
"
I have been using a lot of manual toothbrushes, but after using this toothbrush I would never go back to a manual toothbrushes.
"
"
I have been using electric toothbrushes, beginning with a much more expensive Philips Sonicare toothbrush, for several years. After I broke two of the Sonicare toothbrushes (probably by pressing too hard on them), I bought the Vitality because it was the cheapest electric toothbrush around. To my surprise, I found that it works much better than the Sonicare did. The Oral-B Vitality has a small round brush which can get into hard-to-reach areas and to hard-to-reach surfaces that the large brush on the Sonicare couldn't. Also, the circular motion of the Oral-B Vitality works and cleans much better than the back-and-forth motion of the Sonicare brush. After I switched to the Oral-B Vitality my dentist was surprised at how clean my teeth were! You can get Oral-B electric toothbrushes with wide a range of features and at a wide range of prices, but I found that the low-cost Vitality serves me well. The batteries of cordless electric toothbrushes eventually wear out (after several years, depending on use), but replacement of the low-priced Vitality is affordable.I have also used several different toothbrush heads with the Vitality, but the Floss Action brush is by far my favourite. It's unique design does, indeed, give it the superior cleaning action that the packaging says it does, and it cleans my teeth better than other toothbrush heads do.  I highly recommend this toothbrush & brush-head combination.

Our previous Oral-B electric died and I went looking for a replacement.  This item stood out as being much cheaper than the others.  The quality still seems good though, we've been happy with its performance.  Certainly not the best on the market but still much more effective than using a manual toothbrush.

For a first time user of this product, I have to say I am very impressed. I have been an avid manual brush user for most of my life. Excluding my childhood when I did use an electric toothbrush. I wasn't sure what to expect for the price? I had my reservations. I have used some pretty cheap electric brushes when I was a child and found them to be lacking. Many years have passed since the days of really cheaply made electric brushes. I could be wrong and they still may be out there, but I have to say this brush is not one of them!My teeth felt like I had just come out of a dentist visit for a cleaning. They were literally squeaky clean! I was amazed at the results I have been missing with a manual tooth brush. And I have spent a pretty penny on supposedly effective manual brushes that made a lot of false promises.This toothbrush makes it so much more easier to clean after meals. It has some nice features like a water proof base so you can immediately put your brush back on the charger while it's wet. It also pulsates twice when you press too hard on the brush against your teeth.I think I will be a life long user of this product, because you can't beat the quality for the price, and the effectiveness that manuals just don't produce.
"
"
I am disappointed with the battery autonomy.  It's charge last less than a week.  These NiMH batteries are a real disappointmentThe old Braun that I replaced with this one, although using a NiCad battery, had a charge that would last for several weeks, allowing you to take it on a trip without needing a charger (camping, travels, whatever).The same brush comes in different versions (because packaged with different head), and the floss-action head that comes with this one works relatively well. It actually dislodges some debris that may be stuck between your teeth, which normally only a toothpick or flossing could remove.  Not as good as flossing, but better than other brushes.I'm not going to give it a horrible mark, because got it on special for fifteen bucks, so the quality is proportional to what was spent.  But I didn't get the great deal that I expected. Just my money's worth, nothing more.
"
"
Simple, effective and great value when on sale! However, if you’re hoping to brush your teeth without making a sound... (ie. potentially waking up your roommate, partner or sleeping baby) move on.My previous expensive competitive brand toothbrush died on me recently and although I was always complimented by my dentist for having well cared for teeth and gums, I was miffed that it didn’t have a way to replace the battery without damaging the underside of the toothbrush.It did take a little getting used from switching over from the full headed toothbrushes, but once I felt how clean it made my teeth I quickly converted.I’m really happy with this purchase and realize that even the expensive electric toothbrushes only have about a 2 year shelf life, so I’m not about to fork out for something that has frills when I can have something that does the job perfectly well for less.
"
"
Right off, there is no need to buy a more expensive one. This works as well as could possibly be. I'm super happy with this purchase.This one uses the standard Oral-B brush heads you can buy in bulk, which in my opinion are just as good as the way-over-the-top price of the name brand ones.This is replacing a 10 year old Braun / Oral-B electric toothbrush that finally would not hold a charge. In going to the new one, I've discovered a couple of things:1) The new ones really are better than the older ones. This new one is stronger & faster in brushing than the old one ever was.2) The ergonomics are better now - small changes that reflect a refining & evolution of design.3) My old one had a large base that could be mounted to a wall, this new one has a small base that can't be mounted to the wall that tips over constantly.I haven't come to a conclusion on the brushing head that comes with it. No complaints, but I can't really say I think it's better than the much cheaper standard bulk heads I've bought in the past on Amazon.
"
"
The motor is very powerful. You brush your teeth like a dentist, pressing the brush against one tooth at a time. It gives your gums a good workout. One problem is that if you don't put the brush in your mouth precisely flat, you get bumps from the plastic on the rotating head. They can feel like hard blows against your teeth. The timer measures two minutes by short pauses in the motor operation. All-in-all, I'm very happy with this purchase. It is a high quality brush at a much smaller price than you can get it in stores.
"
"
We decided to save money by replacing our old 230v electric tooth brushes with these ones here in Canada, but the quality is really lacking. They feel so cheap and I feel like I get a better brushing just using a normal toothbrush. I miss how our other toothbrushes would vibrate 4x during the cycle to let you know when to switch to another section of your teeth. The most annoying thing about these toothbrushes is that there is a little hole in the brush head on the shaft that drains sometimes, so if you are brushing your teeth, you end up randomly spilling toothpaste/spit on your shirt even when your mouth was closed while brushing. It's really annoying and I ruin so many shirts if I get dressed before brushing my teeth. I can't wait to replace these!
"
"
This flosser replaced my earlier Oral-B flosser from 10 years ago.  My brush heads from the older model worked on this one.  I found the brush heads that came with this unit was too stiff for my gums.  My dental recommended a softer bruch head.  The unit seem more powerful than the old one and the timer was set for two minutes.  Everything is working well after three months.  Highly recommended.
"
"
The brush is round, and not too large; I find that it is the perfect size for my teeth. There is a timer, where it will cycle through not spinning 4 times at the 2 minute mark. Easy to use, easy to store. When I first used it, I found that it didn't last more than two brushes; later I learned that it wasn't fully charged (just charged long enough to test it) and now that it's fully charged it does last longer. The price is great, it came with replacement heads.It's a little loud, which is typical for a lot of these types of toothbrushes, so for the person first trying it out, there might be a bit of fear and anxiety because of the noise, but it makes brushing so much more efficient, easy, and for me, it's fun. I have problems with brushing my teeth too aggressively, but this has helped me remove that habit.Personally, when I used a regular toothbrush I could not get that smooth, glossy feeling on the back of my front teeth. I also could not easily reach my back teeth without gagging. With this brush, I get that clean feeling on the back of my teeth, and I can also reach the furthest teeth in the back and brush around them easily. No gagging, except for when I brush my tongue, which is normal for me.This was an awesome buy for me.
"
"
I like the fact that I charged it fully and it has kept it's charge for over two weeks of use twice a day. It makes my teeth feel like they do after the dentist cleaning. As you can tell, I am totally happy . I put off buying an electric tooth brush as I have no where in the bathroom to keep the charger plugged in, not necessary with this.. totally satisfied
"
"
I grabbed this toothbrush when it was on sale. I really like it as it seems powerful and well built. The only downside is that my gums always bleed after using it. So people with sensitive teeth need to be aware of this before purchasing it. Otherwise it is a good purchase when on sale.
"
"
I bought this for myself and was able to try the bristles on my teeth for about .2 seconds before freaking put and deciding that I would not be able to use the product. My boyfriend on the other hand loves it!!! I think some people just have sensitive mouths. I have never had a cavity and wanted an electric brush to ensure my continued success, while also be kinder to my gums. For me it will always be a regular old toothbrush.

This toothbrush is great! Every time I'm finished brushing my teeth, I feel like I just came back from the dentist. A few reasons why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I believe it should come with a cover for the brush head instead of buying it separately and also the power of the brush itself  is a bit too powerful that for the first few times you use it on your front teeth, it will hurt.
"
"
After barely two months, it starts and stops without rhyme or reason.  Whether it is on the charger or off, doesn't matter.In the middle of the night it will turn itself on, in the middle of the day it will turn itself on.  Finally just let it die out and threw it in the garbage.  Waste of money.

This oral-b does not disappoint. This is my second oral-b electric tooth brush, I love the way these tooth brushes preform, you just can't get that same over all clean feeling with a manual brush no matter how long you brush. Be aware that this model has no bells and whistles, it is a very basic 2D model. It oscillates and rotates and has the 2 minute timer, but that's about it. That's all I need my toothbrush to do, and for 25.00 dollars it's even more then I could ask for. It also comes with 2 removable brushes and another feature I liked is that it accepts just about all oral-b brush heads. For people that want something simple that does what it's supposed to do, I would definitely recommend this product.
"
"
If you want an electric toothbrush, and you should, Oral B is the way to go.  If you want a basic model that brushes teeth, then this is it.  If you want timers, alarms, bells and whistles then you can spend more on a different model.  I just want to brush my teeth and this model does that perfectly.
"
"
Durable and powerful - you can definitely feel the difference in a great way! Also has great battery life and quick charge.  One minor drawback is that it's so strong there might be residual splashing of toothpaste foam, which is not evident at first but will appear as little white splotches on your faucet and mirror. Very easy to clean though.
"
"
I especially like the price of this toothbrush, and find it has great value for the money!  I use this toothbrush, along with enzymatic toothpaste on my dog's teeth. It not only keeps the tartar from building up on his teeth, but also keeps his breath fresh.
"
"
A bit messy, but I’m getting used to it.  Leaves my mouth feeling really clean.  Easy to use and to keep clean.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and I must admit they do a much better job than a manual brush.
"
"
For my teeth it's  preferable than Sonic care since it's  more agile around the teeth because it rotates rather than moving  up down which allows pivoting from every angle and meaningfully. Does vibrate though and I a  larger brush would be nice. Wonder,  but don't  know, if diff brush  refills than it comes with would be nice. Also comes with Nickel battery. Lithium?  But higher cost.
"
"
Can't believe I waited so long to finally convert to an electric brush. My teeth feel so much cleaner after every brush. The time function is great for making sure that you're not over or under brushing
"
"
I bought 2 of these for my kids 8 years old, They seem to like it better than manual brush.  Package came with 1 extra head.  CONS, they should make it in different colors as my kids share the washroom and I had to put on different brush head so they know which one is theirs.
"
"
My dental hygienist suggested this electric toothbrush to help delay worsening of receding gums. I like how good my gums feel after brushing and the floss action head is great for getting between the teeth.
"
"
I've been using the Oral-B Vitality Floss Action toothbrush for about a week now and I love it. My teeth feel clean and smooth. The timer option is really helpful. I have to be careful not too press down too hard or else I hurt my gums but other than that, this toothbrush is a keeper.
"
"
This is my third Vitality toothbrush and they work just as well as the more expensive Oral-B ones.I purchased this one to leave at work.
"
"
This is what I was expecting, although it's a little aggressive for my gums. It's not something I can use every morning and night, but does it ever clean! Feels like I've had my teeth cleaned at the dentist. I will continue to use it every few days.
"
"
Dont know how to use the timer and no indicator to say whether its charging.The toothbrush i got is not the one in the photos.
"
"
Using it for two years with zero problem. Often there is so.e kind of deposit that grow between the brush and the charget, which can be easily washed away. That is not a problem.
"
"
When I originally was thinking of switching to an electric toothbrush the cost seemed a bit high and I wasn't convinced it would be that much better. This brush is awesome I can actually feel the heads getting between my teeth as I brush. I would recommend this one to anyone great value for money.
"
"
It’s a good investissent! It’s a good price, for quality!! Works good!! And Oral B one of the top marks recommended by a dentist!
"
"
Everything I wanted in a toothbrush.It's a bit stiffer than most toothbrushes but it's exactly what I needed. It cleans to my gums cleaning the plaque that gives me gingervitis.This plus the waterpik equals a clean and healthy mouth.
"
"
I bought it to replace my old electric toothbrush which is probably around 10 years old. It seems to be much better. Has much higher RPM and cleans tooth and gums much better.
"
"
This toothbrush makes me feel like I just came from the dentist every time I use it! Love the sensor to let me know once my 2 minutes are up. Works amazing.
"
"
It's a cheap electric toothbrush.  Works good. Not as fast as the more expensive models but definitely does what it's supposed to.
"
"
Excellent.  I should have got this years ago. My teeth feel so clean and I'm sure I'm getting all the plaque and tartar.I recommend this to everyone. Don't forget to floss. :)
"
"
Enfin mes enfants se brosse bien les dents. Seul problème c'est qu'il n'y a pas de voyant lumineux pour voir si la brosse à dent est rechargée
"
"
Battery completely died a couple days ago.  It's only been charged every 5 to 6 days and only overnight.  Not worth the money.
"
"
I've used this for a few weeks now and am very happy I purchased it. My biggest qualm with my past electric toothbrush was the changing of the battery, but having this rechargeable is wonderful. It also holds a charge for quite a few days so good for short travel trips too.
"
"
Horrible toothbrush.  I ordered it based on the reviews, and it feels like I am brushing my teeth with a diesel powered screw driver.  Really unusable.
"
"
Having using for five or six months now. Really enjoy. It’s a little bit on the loud side, but works well.
"
"
Awesome for the price! I have been using it at night for just over a week and I can see and feel a difference. My teeth feel so clean afterwards!
"
"
The price is amazing for a rechargeable.With two OralB heads as well.Happy Camper.
"
"
Had my prior Oral B for 8 Plus years... well it died and I love the electric brushes... love it.
"
"
Everything other than the battery life is fine. A much deeper clean than manual toothbrush but can be abrasive for people with gum sensitivity.
"
"
Works great but I wish the battery life would last longer for weekend trips.  Good value for the money
"
"
My last one lasted 8 years.... only the battery that gave out on my old one.......  love it!
"
"
My first one, purchased in 2005, finally quit.I bought a replacement at a drug store for $36CADThen I happened to see this listed on Amazon at a price I couldn't refuse.Having both, I alternate each day and they each last for 8 years in daily use, these won't need to be replaced until 2029.I'll need replacement before then... :)
"
"
Does an excellent job of teeth brushing.  My previous Braun brush had been in daily use for 17 years and was getting a bit tired.  This new one seems to do a better job the the previous one ever did.
"
"
Very good product.  Battery lasts for almost three weeks without charging.  Speed of brush is much faster than the original one I purchased several years ago.
"
"
The Braun base combined with Oral B is a win, win.  Good quality all the way.
"
"
I bought this for my son on his dentist's recommendation. It's one of the simpler models but it's effective and well priced.
"
"
Great for travelling as we have a full sized one already. Holds charge well so you don't have to take the charger with you for shorter trips. Works great. Thanks
"
"
Real nice, bought for my oldest son, he now actually brushes his teeth!!!
"
"
Excellent toothbrush. Good speed and power. Makes your teeth feel very clean. Just about to buy my husband one but the item is showing no longer available. Too bad.
"
"
I bought this to replace an old model of the same make..this one seems to do a better job..perhaps it's the  brush
"
"
Works well for an entry-level brush. We also have the 7000 Pro series brushes, and this is NOT as nice as the higher end ones, but for a low price, it works as expected.
"
"
All of the family use these, works fine replacement for a dropped and old one
"
"
Durable, cleans teeth really well. compct. I would buy again.
"
"
Cleans my teeth better than any other tooth brush I've used. Very pleased.
"
"
Works well and easy to change heads. Comes with the stand charger but the brush itself is cordless for easy use. Good value for the price.
"
"
Répond aux attentes, mais un étui pour la brossette aurait été pratique pour le transport.
"
"
So much better than the battery operated ones I've been using. Thought the brush head might be too small to be effective but it works great.
"
"
Works amazing and got it for a great deal. Can’t belive it came with a charger as well.
"
"
I purchased this under the discount.  For the past 10 months, it has been running pretty smoothly all the time, even if sometimes I forget to charge the battery it can still run for several days.Would recommend to whom want a decent toothbrush.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Would not charge with the stand provided, but would charge with my husband's stand.  Had to return.
"
"
powerful enough to me, battery lasts for about 2 wks, wireless charging is safe and convenient. Not quite sure about the actual floss action though, I guess better than a manual brush. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the noise.
"
"
Great toothbrush. It cleans well and I dont have to put in much effort, which is important to me because I usually fall asleep in the bathroom.
"
"
It is great for the price! I have braces so I need a toothbrush that cleans my teeth as much as possible without taking a lot of my time. It has floss action that works in between teeth that saves my time. Great product!
"
"
Love this brush so well worth the money, works just as well and any super expensive brush. Good battery life
"
"
so far so good. its completely waterproof, so I brush my teeth while I shower, the docking mechanism doesn't have any exposed metal connectors ( or any kind of connectors for that matter, what kind of sorcery is charging this thing?)
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I ever had....It is very strong.
"
"
It's affordable and not gimmicky - like some of the other electric brushes. One improvement might be a light that indicates when the unit is charging and when it is fully charged. Other than that - no complaints.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien et elle est puissante, très bon brossage, efficace.
"
"
Greatest power toothbrush I ever had.
"
"
Doesn't turning on after 1.5 month of use
"
"
Great toothbrush, but I regret not taking the one for sensitive teeth/gums. Although I didn't think I needed sensitive, this toothbrush makes my gums bleed. So, I will buy a pack of sensitive bristle heads.
"
"
Good to keep the plak down.
"
"
Works ok for the price but no battery charge light so I don't know when the battery needs charging. I bought 2 and Oral-B refuses to honor the 2nd $7 discount coupon. Never had this prob with Braun.
"
"
My dentist highly recommended this rotating brush and it is great.
"
"
Works as you would expect
"
"
Liked everything. Unbelievable fast delivery received the order in about 24hours of placing it
"
"
good  for bring at work
"
"
The brush that came with the unit is very traumatic .  I used regular brush and works great.
"
"
does what it's supposed to ; )
"
"
It does an excellent job of cleaning
"
"
Cleans well, and family really likes it. Charge last pretty long. Comfortable grip. Teeth really feel cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.
"
"
Comparable to the electronic toothbrush my friend bought at $100+, totally functional and don't need to worry about recharging. Clean teeth from all angles.
"
"
Love it.  Ordering another one for my dog.
"
"
Before I tried one, I always assumed electric brushes are for lazy folk. Until I tried one....and wow, I can't ever go back. My teeth feel like I just got back from the dentist, albeit twice a day.
"
"
This was a great price for a great product that works perfectly. Would absolutely recommend to anyone that is looking for a new toothbrush
"
"
Love this tooth brush
"
"
Its an ok electric toothbrush for the money but doesnt rotate already as quickly as when I first started using. Still, its better then a manual toothbrush
"
"
good buy and the heads were great as well
"
"
Product was a gift. Timely delivery and product was exactly as advertised.
"
"
Love my toothbrush. It's been over 4 months now since professional cleaning and I got this brush right after, so my teeth never felt cleaner. Good buy and it was almost $10 cheaper than at Rexall.
"
"
Really does the job well
"
"
Nothing too fancy, basic electric toothbrush. Personally love it as I just made the shift from non electric brushes. Definitely a good model to start with.
"
"
tooth brush is the first electric one i have had, works great and really makes your teeth feel like new again!
"
"
best value in rechargeable electric toothbrushes.  floss action is a super deep clean.  better than expected power.
"
"
average low gam
"
"
Works great.  Teeth feel clean.
"
"
amazing product
"
"
Great tooth brush. Long lasting battery (Lithium Ion). Love it
"
"
Love it, makes oral hygiene care so quick and efficient.
"
"
My teeth feel cleaner.  I wish I had bought this sooner!
"
"
I honestly forgot how clean my teeth feel with an electric toothbrush, this is great and totally affordable, plus it comes with an extra head!
"
"
Purchased this as a gift for a family member and haven't heard any complaints. They've told me that it's far superior to a manual toothbrush
"
"
Replaced the same model. So far so good.
"
"
just replaced my 10 yr old oral-b. Hope this new one goes 10yrs
"
"
Only lasted 90 days Ugh!
"
"
they do a good job cleaning
"
"
Works great. Can't go wrong with Oral B. really like the flossing action. Teeth feel really clean after using it.
"
"
Good unit
"
"
Good
"
"
So happy to have an electric toothbrush that works! My last one literally died and I had to use it like a manual toothbrush until this one arrive. Whole family is using Oral-B electric toothbrushes now.
"
"
Works well Had one the same but battery quit
"
"
Good quality toothbrush
"
"
Bon produit
"
"
Good Product overall. Cheaper than most electric brushes out there, but the head tend to be a bit too strong for its own good, and makes a mess.
"
"
Great electric toothbrush. As advertised. Base doesn't have a light or charging indicator, but the brush hasn't died yet so I assume it's charging!
"
"
Great product. Got this for my husband as he lost his old one on the road and he loves loves it.
"
"
Works great! Great value for money
"
"
Love this tooth brush, read some negative reviews before purchasing... but bought it anyways and I haven't been disappointed.
"
"
for 35 $ can't beat it.
"
"
Works awesome. Love the floss action, big improvement to my gums in a few weeks!
"
"

Excellent little electric toothbrush. Affordable, effective, charge lasts for 2 weeks! Easy to clean and takes up so little space.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Fonctionne bien tel que decrit
"
"
Absolutely nothing to complain about, although this is my first electric toothbrush. I am definitely never going back to a manual one. I especially like the two minute timer feature.
"
"
Real from my sonic one, cleans between teeth excellent, and little noisy but ok. Lite weight.
"
"
Very happy with how it cleans my teeth
"
"
It vibrated so hard that I feel like it is going to knock my teeth out.  No electric toothbrush needs to slam teeth so hard.
"
"
Lots of power
"
"
It was a replacement for one I've had for years and was what I expected
"
"
Worth every dollar! I'm glad i didn't spend for something that does the same thing as this one. Works well, charges fast and long battery life...nothing else is needed!
"
"
Very good the toothbrush for this price .
"
"
Seems very good
"

good item for the price..everyday I be brushing yo!

Who enjoys brushing their teeth? With this product now I do. My teeth feel much cleaner and the product is fab!

Toujours eu ce genre de brosse a dents. Elle est encore pareil depuis maintenant plusieurs années donc, ceci reflete la qualité du produit.
"
"
This is my second Oral B and the quality is great.
"
"
Works fine
"
"
I like it very much. Simple and does what I wanted. They could take a little more time to explain clearly how best to use it.
"
"
Awesome
"
"
All the reviews were right.  This is by far the best electric toothbrush out there.  I bought 2 when it was on sale.  My gums definitely look and feel healthier after a week of using this toothbrush.
"
"
Best tooth brush so far. Recommend to anyone who's interested in changing an auto brush
"
"
Everytime I'm moving to a new country I'm buying one of those. Do its job perfectly.
"
"
Works great.  No problems so far
"
"
Great
"
"
Love the 'flossing' pieces that are in the bristles. They work great to get things out like popcorn!I'll definitely be buying these again.
"
"
I have had used this toothbrush for over two years, Its a great cheap toothbrush that gets the job done. Highly recommend
"
"
bought for hubby he adores it... so good for his gums.. his words..the best electric brush he has ever had. good price too.
"
"
Works as expected.
"
"
works great, my daughter loves it.
"
"
Love it.
"
"
It's OK. I believe flossing & using the mouth wash, in one word determination is more important for having healthy teeth & gums. Glad I didn't spend a crazy amount for my electric tooth brush.
"
"
Works like a charm. Arrived very fast!
"
"
After using a regular toothbrush for 32 years this was a game changer.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush !!! Thank you.
"
"
I have had several oral b rechargeable toothbrushes and are a very good product.  Like the timer and floss action.
"
"
Great buy!!! Great Price
"
"
Works great and a great price. As a bonus it fits on my old Oral B charger. Now I have a small one for travelling!

Fantastic! Cleans tooth so nicely feels like just got dentist cleaning! Good price too!

Soft and comfortable toothbrush. Good quality and will definitely use again in future.

The tooth brushes are fine however, they are not as pictured. The package I recieved had 4 blue ones and 1 purple one. Not what I wanted. Other than that all good.
"

works well.
"

And they work fine!
"
"
I would have liked a pack of different colors. I got all the same one. I usually split this with my husband. Now I have to buy another brand, I dont want to risk getting the same colors all over again.
"
"
Received it today. No crunch. Just sticks to teeth and roof of the mouth

The bristles on these toothbrushes are true ultra soft. For EVER I thought harder bristles meant a better clean but I’ve found that soft bristles do a much better job getting into crevices and cleaning the gum line without irritating gums. My gums started to recede a bit from my overzealous brushing with hard bristles trying to get the fresh-from-the-dentist clean feeling. But this brush gives that feeling 100x better than any firm bristles.I love the black colour, just wish it was solid black or black and white but that honestly doesn’t matter at the end of the day.The price at the time of reviewing is phenomenal (3.99 for two.)
"
"
I've been using these toothbrushes for a while now. I have sensitive gums and a small mouth, I find these are so soft on my gums, fits nicely in my mouth, cleans really well, and I really like the long thin floss like bristles that get between the teeth.
"
"
These are amazing. You would never guess that such a cheap toothbrush would make your mouth feel like you’d just had a professional cleaning but it does. I bought 5 of these and will buy more!
"
"
Great brush.  The charcoal is just a gimmick, but the bristle design isn't.  The marketing wank is strong with this one. Charcoal was proven a long time ago to not aid your teeth. If your camping or hiking you can use ashes from last night's fire as toothpaste, but it's just temporary replacement.  The bristles are amazing, basically replaces flossing!!!  Will buy again.
"
"
Great item for people who have sensitive teeth or receding gums, better than the usual ""soft"" synthetic bristles on other toothbrushes...also pretty good price for a product that is apparently difficult to find in stores
"
"
Actually it is NOT soft.. but it is not hard. The medium is right measurement for this product. COMPARE to other toothbushes in this price arragement, this is the best quaility and best option. It has thin tips of britles to make easier to get into the interproximal area of the teeth and it is not rough tough than other product with same price arragement that I tried. If you want to buy cheep toothbrush, I strongly recommend this one.
"
"
I found out after I bought that the charcoal on these is the color, not some infused bristles. I don't even know if you can find charcoal bristles but given the rise in charcoal toothpaste I think they named it charcoal to give that impression. Could find many cheaper equivalents at Dollarama. No tongue cleaner either, you could probably get a 3 pack of good oral B toothbrushes for a little more.
"
"
Soft and cleans well. Never used this type of toothbrush with soft bristles that actually clean (usually the softer ones bend too much and aren’t as effective). And you get 2 of them in the package. They sell 1 for the same price in local drugstores near me (in Canada there is little to no competition and there is much price gouging). Didn’t buy local, got 2 for the price of 1, received a good product and it was delivered to my doorstep. Thank you.

Great brush.  The charcoal is just a gimmick, but the bristle design isn't.  The marketing wank is strong with this one. Charcoal was proven a long time ago to not aid your teeth. If your camping or hiking you can use ashes from last night's fire as toothpaste, but it's just temporary replacement.  The bristles are amazing, basically replaces flossing!!!  Will buy again.
"
"
Great item for people who have sensitive teeth or receding gums, better than the usual ""soft"" synthetic bristles on other toothbrushes...also pretty good price for a product that is apparently difficult to find in stores
"
"
Actually it is NOT soft.. but it is not hard. The medium is right measurement for this product. COMPARE to other toothbushes in this price arragement, this is the best quaility and best option. It has thin tips of britles to make easier to get into the interproximal area of the teeth and it is not rough tough than other product with same price arragement that I tried. If you want to buy cheep toothbrush, I strongly recommend this one.
"
"
I found out after I bought that the charcoal on these is the color, not some infused bristles. I don't even know if you can find charcoal bristles but given the rise in charcoal toothpaste I think they named it charcoal to give that impression. Could find many cheaper equivalents at Dollarama. No tongue cleaner either, you could probably get a 3 pack of good oral B toothbrushes for a little more.
"
"
Soft and cleans well. Never used this type of toothbrush with soft bristles that actually clean (usually the softer ones bend too much and aren’t as effective). And you get 2 of them in the package. They sell 1 for the same price in local drugstores near me (in Canada there is little to no competition and there is much price gouging). Didn’t buy local, got 2 for the price of 1, received a good product and it was delivered to my doorstep. Thank you.

These brushes are my favourite and, they are very soft and gentle on my gums. They're hard to find in stores, so I was pleased to find them on Amazon. Subscribe to save even more! Will repurchase in the future.
"
"
These are great toothbrushes. Ever since I tried them for the first time I was hooked, will never use anything but these. That is all I need to say. Would recommend to others looking for a quality soft toothbrush for sure.
"
"
great bush, soft but strong enough to clean well. But NOT  a COMPACT head. Hard to use when  you have a small mouth and you want to reach the back of it to clean...
"
"
Great toothbrush. Does an amazing job. The bristles are so thin they get into the gums and remove everything. Only negative is that I ordered the pictured balck and blue toothbrush and recieved black and pink.
"
"
Good value for money. Nothing fancy, but bristles do not degrade quickly like other charcoal toothbrushes I’ve tried.As to the value of brushing with charcoal bristles, I have no idea.
"
"
The bristles are amazing. Never used this type of brush previously. The handle could be thicker and if there are more bristles it is good for large mouth person like me. Otherwise, it's awesome
"
"
This toothbrush is super fine, super smooth and super durable!  I have used one for a few years and it is still in good shape.  Highly recommended.
"
"
Decent toothbrush, bristles are definitely thin. But the charcoal fades after the first 3 or 4 uses. Don't really get the point of it!
"
"
Best toothbrush I have found so far. Just wish we could pick the color. Ordered 2, 1 for me 1 for wife received 2 pink ones. Not the end of the world but Meh.
"
"
Works well as a simple manual toothbrush. Bristles are very fine at the tips, so they get the gum line well. But the charcoal aspect is kinda pointless
"
"
Great tooth brush it’s soft so no hurting your gums and the bristles are thin so they can get into hard to reach areas
"
"
Even after using it for a week, my teeth are significantly cleaner because it cleans much closer to the gums than the Oral-B Pro-Health toothbrush (with the rubber bristles) I had before.
"
"
I love how soft the bristle were. I just wish the size of the head was smaller, it makes it hard to reach the back molars.
"
"
Great product! Great price ! Works perfect for my all natural charcoal tooth paste .Soft & easy to clean.
"
"
My husband doesn’t like it because the handle became too slippy when wet, but I love them because the soft slim tips cleans my teeth better
"
"
It’s very soft, excellent day to day toothbrush.  Pair it up with Colgate charcoal & your teeth will be whiter than ever.
"
"
Love this brush. So soft and I got such a good clean from it. No bleeding :)
"
"
Gentle on the gums and good cleaning.  Recommended by my dentist.  I won't use anything else.
"
"
I love this toothbrush, it's very soft. I've been using it for years, the pack came a little bent on the very top, didn't affect the toothbrush at all, but Amazon should be a little more careful.
"
"
The only toothbrush I buy now. I bought it because the black looked cool. The bristles are super fine so they go deep into the space between your teeth. My teeth have that “just left the dentist” feel every day.
"
"
I’ve been using these brushes for a couple years now - great results
"
"
Good price and they work super well as a person with braces.
"
"
I love this toothbrush! I have sensitive gums but this is honestly really really gentle to brush with.
"
"
I love the feel of the bristles on my gums to get a good clean. I have never had a black coloured toothbrush before so it is very sleek and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. Does the job and gets it done!
"
"
Nice product, soft and nice product
"
"
Super soft and leave mouth feeling polished. Some loose bristles cane out at first brushing. Fine afterwards.
"
"
Better price than in the store! These work well especially for smokers!
"
"
I have a small mouth and sensitive gums. I’ve tried so many different kinds of tooth brush. This is my holy grail. Its size and softness is perfect. This is the only tooth brush I’ve usung.
"
"
excellent pour les dents sensibles
"
"
I really like the softness of the brush, I feel as it gets in between my teeth better
"
"
slim soft bristle does a good job with my gum. My favourite
"
"
Great for small mouths.
"
"
Meh its a cheap brush but does the job
"
"
Does the job. Don’t know if the item actually has charcoal in it. Very soft toothbrush. Satisfied.
"
"
Feels like a professional teethcleaning
"
"
so flimsy and not sturdy at all
"
"
Love it
"
"
Great toothbrush for my sensitive teeth. I like the slim bristles, actually feels quite nice to brush my teeth now! Good price for a branded product.
"
"
Rien d’exceptioNelle !
"
"
Great
"
"
Super
"
"
Tried this toothbrush a while ago as a freebie from my dentist. Never looked back! Does a great a job cleaning between my teeth.
"
"
As described
"
"
Bristles are too soft to clean the teeth properly.
"
"
Found my new favorite toothbrush
"
"
It's very soft and easy on the gum. Will buy more.
"
"
The idea of Charcoal is useless. The transporter choice of Amazon is questionnable.
"
"

My new favourite toothbrush
"
"
Great for its purpose
"
"
Awesome toothbrush with soft charcoal bristles
"
"
Bon goût
"
"
This toothbrush isnt for everyone. It was way too soft and had far too few bristles to leave my mouth feeling clean.
"
"
I had bought in the past and the quality was better
"
"
Good
"
"
Recieved already used product. First review with photos was removed
"
"
Could really use some extra bristles.
"
"
Good
"

Not a true Colgate brand. Copy and cheap.
"
"
I love the fine tips.
"
"
Good
"
"
Nice product
"

Good for new charcoal
"
"
Worth it
"
"
Best cleaning toothbrush I have ever used.  Soft but scrubbing. Try it with Tom's of Maine Simply White fluoride-free peppermint toothpaste for an amazing polishing!
"
"
Happy with this purchase!
"
"
This  is the only toothbrush i have ever repurchased and I will continue to do so.  It is very soft on the teeth and gums.
"
"
I am already on my 3rd order and can't tell you how much of a difference this brush makes. Even my dentist has been asking me what I have changed since my teeth and gums are so much better. I used to use the Sonicare toothbrush but found even when I was done using the Sonicare this soft charcoal brush still removed more food remnants which is unbelievable. Try it and you will see. I have bought them and they ship from India which takes a long time but you can also do the Amazon Add On option and have it in a few days.
"
"
Gotta admit i was skeptical about the whole  charcoal craze but decided to give this toothbrush a try. Holy was i surprised by the results! It has a finer tip so as you brush you feel as if you just flossed as well. Leaves your mouth feeling extremely clean. Havent noticed a whiter teeth yet but definitely cleaner. Its not to be used as substitute to flossing. But i will definitely make this my regular toothbrush. Highly recommend!
"
"
Excellent slim profile toothbrush.  If you have a smaller mouth and/or jaw issues this is perfect....reaches way to the back and around with little jaw opening.  If you usually need an ""ultra soft"" toothbrush, the ""soft"" version of this one compares very well to the ""ultra soft"" version of many others out there.
"
"
was looking forward to trying the new style.  So disappointed.  The handle slips in the hand no matter how hard you grip and try to control it while brushing your teeth. This is true if your handle gets wet.  Hard to brush and keep toothbrush dry though . I also found the length a little short.  I really love the older style and absolutely love the bristle!!  Don't stop making them please!
"
"
[edit] - These are definitely bad for my gums; they are sharp. They were not appropriate for cleaning at the gumline.I don't know if this will work out for me.  It seems a little TOO soft for my needs.  I think I'd crush these bristles trying to get a proper ""squeak"" out of my teeth.
"
"
Colgate Slim Soft Deep Clean Compact Head Toothbrush, Soft.  Excellent.  The slim shape is very effective in cleaning all the crevices in my jumble of crooked molars.  I can reach a bit under the gum line comfortably.  The Toothbrush doesn't hurt my gums at all. No bleeding. These are now my new regular toothbrushes.
"
"
Favourite toothbrush! I usually don't have time to floss in the morning and I feel like it at least does something? Also I really like the look, very different than your traditional boring ol' toothbrush.
"
"
My favorite toothbrushes of all time. Out of all the gimmicks and crap they came out with over the years these fine bristles actually clean better than anything else (manual or electric) in my opinion. Seriosly reduces amount of debris when flossing
"
"
Finally, a toothbrush that makes me look forward to brushing my teeth. Soft, and yet extremely effective. My teeth have never felt cleaner, and I love that it's not some big clunky toothbrush.
"
"
I don't know if the black charcoal actually makes a difference, but the quality of this toothbrush is amazing overall. Highly recommended!
"
"
It is just a regular toothbrush with slim bristels. Not sure what they mean by charcoal...will not buy again.
"
"
I didn't like this toothbrush at first, as my gums felt sore when I used it.After the first few days, that sensation subsided and I'm now truly enjoying it.
"
"
Not sure how the charcoal part comes in exactly as I didn't notice a lot coming off of the bristles. Works well as a regular toothbrush though
"
"
The head is narrower and longer than most other toothbrushes but I do like the results.  Teeth feel clean and its gentle on the gums
"
"
Very happy with this product. Bristles are very soft. It's especially good for those with thin gums.Definitely will purchase more in the future.
"
"
Very very very soft bristles ! To soft to actually brush your teeth lol
"
"
Soft bristles and basic but not sure how long it'll last. Decent for the price.
"
"
This has been my go to brush for years now...  nice charcoal covered brush so your not just using a standard bacteria covered brush.
"
"
Way too soft and no benefit of the charcoal feature
"
"
Great value.  I have this on a subscription!
"
"
Love, love this toothbrush.  Please don't discontinue it.
"
"
Been using this for a few years now and still feel great and really clean. Gonna keep on using them!
"
"
If ur gums are sensitive the toothbrush is super soft.
"
"
Good toothbrush. I like it. Good price.
"
"
Soft but flexible, strong and durable.
"
"
good price - good durability so far .
"
"
Was slimmer than expected
"
"
This is my new toothbrush of choice
"
"
As expected.
"
"
This toothbrush has very soft bristle, so it is perfect for those who have sensitive gum.
"
"
These are nice soft brushes, especially if you’re using charcoal toothpaste
"
"
Simply heavenly. No other toothbrush even comes close.
"
"
very soft to your gums and teeth. The bristles are as of kids tooth brush
"
"
too soft on the gums, and charcoal wears off quickly. doesn't clean the teeth effectively - don't waste your money
"
"
Good for sensitive gums
"
"
Nice
"
"
great toothbrush i love it!
"

Parfait!

Love it, light Wright feels great

Works great and is easy for my 2.5 year old to handle because it’s not too big. Now if only I could convince him to use it on a regular basis...
"
"
I seen the bad reviews but thought this is a colgate product. Na it is a piece of garbage. I gave it to my grandson and batteries died after about 3 days worth of brushing. Even after changing the batteries it would constantly stop working while  he was using it.  Bad buy!
"
"
New open can not be used, replace with a new battery is still not working! Neither toothbrush works properly! The quality of this reduced commodity is too poor!
"
"
This is our 2nd colgate peppa toothbrush. For whatever reason, they die on us very soon after using them. Battery change doesn't help. Amazon replaced the first one. Second one also died. We have an Oral-B Star Wars one and that one has been fine.
"
"
I know it's a cheap disposable electric toothbrush for kids but this thing bogs down with the lightest pressure.  My daughter had an alternate brand disposable for quite some time and while I had to replace the batteries a time or two it has NEVER had an issue with bogging down while brushing.
"
"
Bought this for my 4 & 6 year old, naked tooth brushing time go ALOT smoother. They’re not as bulky and heavy as the older powered toothbrushes so it’s great!
"
"
We ordered this for my son and also ordered a Peppa pig one for my daughter. My daughter’s worked fine. The Batman toothbrush we ordered for my son shuts off when brushing his teeth like it can’t handle it. If we hold the on button down consistently it’s a bit better but very lacking power. Unfortunately I’m pretty sure it’s a defective one.
"
"
My 2 year old loves this toothbrush. It does go through batteries fairly quickly, but they are easy to change. Would highly suggest to help toddlers brush their teeth better!
"
"
I got a bad batch.. the battery died already. My son likes to use it . Easy to handle and maneuver. But yeah the battery is gone
"
"
Very poor quality brush compared to the OralB ones. The brush audibly slows down and hardly spins when you are putting a bit of pressure on it against the teeth. My daughter loves Peppa but she is equally happy with the OralB frozen one that works and cleans far better!

My child loved it and said it was the best toothbrush ever. No need to keep your finger on it for the spin. One click on and off. Just perfect. Now they're excited to brush their teeth!!
"
"
Great, except the life span for one of two i bought was 2 weeks.  Kind of disappointing for my son.
"
"
These toothbrushes are great! They look exactly like the picture and are cheaper than in store. The head of these is small enough for a little mouth. My kids enjoy brushing with these.
"
"
They batteries were either garbage or worn out or old only last like 5 days
"
"
Just received the toothbrush and so far seems good. My 3 yr old can turn on and off and is very excited to brush his teeth.
"
"
Great product, my kids use these all the time, we just find they ware down quickly...
"
"
Works great and my son absolutely loves it. Compared with other children's toothbrushes such as oral b, this one is only a printed picture, my a 3d character shape.
"
"
Good value for money, i hope the batteries last well.
"
"
Kids love it. Cleans their teeth. Works well.

Run out of battery in several use

quality is good, color is very nice . my daughter likes it very much

Deceiving title!!! The head doesn't rotate as advertised and just vibrates a bit.

Exactly as pictures and works perfectly

It’s not worth it. The bristle are not soft for kids it’s hurt them. You can find it better one in any other store for a cheaper price

Très bien

I recently switched from a manual toothbrush to a battery powered toothbrush for my four year old. I was concerned that the manual toothbrush was just not getting the job done quite good enough, especially if I allowed him to do his own teeth.This has made a big difference and has given me a less anxiety when he brushes his own teeth. Great purchase, highly recommend for the extra coverage it provides.
"
"
Kids like these.They can be a bit hard to click on or off for the kids, adults have no problem.They work well.Last about a year before the brush is toast.I prefer these since it’s faster and does a better job than they do.
"
"
Usually these types of toothbrushes are great, but this one lasted only 2 weeks before the battery was dead
"
"
Super cute brush -  my daughter was in love instantly!  But it is a super powerful brush and really noisy compared to the other electric brushes we've purchased in the past.
"
"
Battery lasted about 2 minutes out of the packagingThey were also back ordered for a few monthsWe bought 2 of them and the EXACT same issue
"
"
Batman Toothbrush does it job easy for kids to hold and work.
"
"
Perfect for my 6yr old nephew, he loves batman
"

It is fine and cost less, but it is not better than Oral B

"
Awesome! Daughter enjoys!
"
"
Kids love it
"
"
We ordered 2 of these... one works and the other one does not.
"
"
Have not use as yet..it look very good.no complain.
"
"
I did not receive the toothbrush although it is indicated that I actually did in February.
"
"
Died within two weeks of having it. Batteries were not replaceable
"
"
Kid loved it
"
"
Great
"
"
Exactly as pictures and works perfectly
"
"
she  live it
"
"
my girls love it
"
"
It’s not worth it. The bristle are not soft for kids it’s hurt them. You can find it better one in any other store for a cheaper price
"

Très bien

I recently switched from a manual toothbrush to a battery powered toothbrush for my four year old. I was concerned that the manual toothbrush was just not getting the job done quite good enough, especially if I allowed him to do his own teeth.This has made a big difference and has given me a less anxiety when he brushes his own teeth. Great purchase, highly recommend for the extra coverage it provides.
"
"
Kids like these.They can be a bit hard to click on or off for the kids, adults have no problem.They work well.Last about a year before the brush is toast.I prefer these since it’s faster and does a better job than they do.
"
"
Usually these types of toothbrushes are great, but this one lasted only 2 weeks before the battery was dead
"
"
Super cute brush -  my daughter was in love instantly!  But it is a super powerful brush and really noisy compared to the other electric brushes we've purchased in the past.
"
"
Battery lasted about 2 minutes out of the packagingThey were also back ordered for a few monthsWe bought 2 of them and the EXACT same issue
"
"
Batman Toothbrush does it job easy for kids to hold and work.
"
"
Perfect for my 6yr old nephew, he loves batman
"
"
It is fine and cost less, but it is not better than Oral B
"
"
Bon produit
"
"
my children are love brush teeth now, The battery lasts about one month. Bought it for c $2.70
"
"
This arrived broken.
"

Parfait

Many years ago Colgate 360 Ultra Soft was very good.  They were extremely soft and good for brushers who are a bit agressive.  Sadly, this brand has gone the way of so many others by cutting back on quality and replacing elements that made this once great product, just another plain harsh toothbrush.  Not recommended.I now have to soak them in hot water for an hour before using them.  And even then, i am very light to the tough on my teeth out of fear they will strip my enamel off -- they are that hard.
"
"
These are not ultra soft. They are hard. The abnormal handle shape is uncomfortable to use. The brush heads are too big. Overall, these just suck. These Colgate brushes are just garbage compared to the Sensodyne brushes.
"
"
Quality is not very good and it only last for couple weeks on daily usage. It is not as soft as other brand's extra soft products. won't buy again
"
"
The bristles are way too hard and l won’t use these toothbrushes because my dentist recommended an extra-soft toothbrush.
"
"
Soft.  The back of the toothbrush head is a soft rubber that kind of grabs at your cheek but it wares off after a while.
"
"
Very soft. I have sensitive teeth and gums that need soft brushes and these work very well. Highly recommend
"
"
The softest toothbrush I've managed to get my hands on. Slightly pricey but worth it if you have receding gums.
"
"
I was expecting the brush to be a little harder. It's so soft that it won't look nice after a couple of brushes and it will start to flatten out. Also because it is too soft it might not clean between the teeths properly.
"
"
Super soft! It feels really nice brushing with this toothbrush. My gums don't hurt anymore. I will buy again for sure.
"
"
Was surprised at how soft this toothbrush is. Great for recceeding gums.

So soft but effective. Pricey but they’re brand names so...
"
"
Good toothbrushes. Expensive but they last a few months.
"
"
Excellent ! Very soft and gentle on my gums and teeth ! Good price also!
"
"
Just like the kind you find in store but cheaper.
"
"
Not the best toothbrush ever, but fine
"
"
Excellent, happy with the purchase
"
"
Finally a toothbrush with bristles that are actually soft as advertised.
"
"
Best brushes I've had in a long time!
"
"
Husband has sensitive gums and likes these toothbrushes alot.
"
"
Super doux sur les gencives.  Sauf que cette brosse ne dure pas longtemps!
"
"
I start buying this toothbrush regularly. It is gentle on gum.
"
"
Needed a sensitive brush and this is as good as we could hope for. Satisfied!
"
"
Good
"
"
This product packaging says 'Ultra Soft' but is closer to a 'Medium"". Not even a Soft!!!!!!!Packaging says ""Made in Switzerland"".
"
"
Great quality at a great price thank you
"
"
soft on the gums same as the ones my dentist recommended
"
"
The value compared to buying in store is terrific. I like the ultra soft toothbrushes and these are great.
"
"
Good
"
"
Great price
"
"
Very soft bristle for sensitive teeth.
"
"
Works great for sensitive gums, they're a life saver.
"
"
Almost impossible to find in stores around here, these are the only ones my mom likes now! Super gentle.
"
"
After two uses the bristles began to fall off. It felt poorly made for the price.
"
"
fake ad, very hard, wasted money
"
"
First use.... loose bristles in my mouth.. disgusting. ..
"
"
Great
"
"
love it
"
"
Not as soft as I expected. I want a ultra soft one
"
"
Great
"
"
Its very soft
"
"
I must have received a faulty one cuz it only works some times ... and very temperamental when it does ... not impressed at all
"
"
I ordered these quite a while ago in preparation for when my current toothbrushes were used up. Finally opened the package a few days ago and while they are advertised as Sensitive and Ultra Soft, they are at least a medium firmness. Very disappointed and went out and bought a new toothbrush that actually is as sensitive and soft as its wrapping says it is. I should have tried this product immediately on receiving, but I believed they were as Ultra Soft as the name implies. I would have returned them, but I've had them for months.
"
"
It is a toothbrush, stick it in your mouth and like it.
"
"
These are my new favourite toothbrushes!
"
"
I usually buy soft toothbrushes, but this time I picked up an extra soft set. They are just as good!
"
"
Dandy toothbrush. What else us there to say?!
"
"
Very much satisfied
"
"
I wouldn't normally think about reviewing, of all things, a toothbrush, but these are worth your consideration.There is one other toothbrush which I would prefer, which is super extra soft, but these toothbrushes are the next best thing.It's hard to find toothbrushes which are ultra soft, and these fit the bill.  They are firmer than I would have initially desired, but they have worked out perfectly. Perfectly!They have a bristle pattern that makes no sense to me.The back of the head is textured to be used as a tongue scraper for those who need it.When I brush my teeth, I get the mysterious ""squeak"" that my dentist mentioned.  Starting with dentist-cleaned teeth then using this toothbrush is a phenomenal experience and it's really encouraging for me to produce that sound.  A quality toothpaste helps a lot with this.  It's worth paying double for your toothpaste and just using a sensible amount of it, so you get a better cleaning experience (not just better cleaning, but the act of brushing seems more satisfying/effective to you)For those who wouldn't want a soft toothbrush because they don't work well for your chewing surfaces, get a medium toothbrush for your chewing surfaces, cheeks and tongue and then use this for your vertical surfaces so you are safe on your gums.  This technique is particularly recommended for those with periodontitis, pocketing, gum recession or the like.I put this on a subscription and I'm buying A LOT OF THESE.  I'm sick of all the revisions and models of toothbrush, and I just want one consistent thing for the rest of my life.
"
"
These toothbrushes are just what the dentist ordered for me to use, they are soft enough so my gums won’t bleed and they leave my teeth feeling fresh
"
"
My go to toothbrushes.. love the tongue scrubbier on the back, they work great!
"
"
Very artificial bristles, did not continue to use.
"
"
2 toothbrushes 1 was sensitive soft 1 was not!!!
"
"
Work just as I thought
"
"
Very soft bristles
"
"
Not as soft as I was hoping
"
"
good
"
"
Exactly as described.
"
"
I love this toothbrush.
"
"
Good brushes.
"
"
Not as soft as the GUM ultra soft tooth brushes...
"
"
I thought these would be a softer bristle than they were.
"
"
It is OK.
"
"
I like it OK, except it has a weird rubber circle in the middle of the bristles, which makes it a bit uncomfortable to brush with. Why!?!?!
"
"
Purchased these after my dentist told me that I have sensitive teeth and gums. I feel the difference compared to other brushes I have tried. These are more gentle and softer.
"
"
Not that easy to find ultra soft brushes at a decent price, these are reasonable, have a tongue cleaner, and work fine.
"
"
Works like it should.
"
"
Great toothbrush, I find it a bit difficult sometimes to find electric toothbrushes like this in MEDIUM and not just SOFT.  I took one star away because in the older models, you could replace the battery in it and now it seems that the batteries are no longer user-replaceable :-(
"
"
I wear mine out b4 the battery & guess what the least plaque I’ve ever had. 😊👍👍
"
"
Love this much better than a spin head toothbrush. It feels like my teeth are much cleaner after as well.
"
"
The battery is replaceable, and the vibration is strong. Definitely better than your average toothbrush
"
"
on subscription , good price
"
"
Like the vibration on my gums but it is a tooth brush not much more you can say about it
"
"
Really like the brush!
"
"
Great little beast. Battery is replaceable and comes fully juiced. Great price too.
"
"
Amélioration a porter. Fais juste vibrer... Ne brosse pas
"

They send me a hard one and I noticed only after I started using it!!!!Work as intended

Oh this baby cleans good. High quality brissles, not sure if the vibration does anything but feels like it does
"
"
Works great and arrived fast
"
"
cheap toothbrush but very effective
"
"
Great toothbrush for the price, very powerful.
"
"
Not bad. But wonder why you need to push down hard. Just for it to pulse.
"
"
GOOD PRICE
"
"
Tooth brush works but way to much waste. The design is so you cannot easily change the battery. Making the whole tooth brush garbage in like 2-3 months time (if you brush 3x/day for the recommended 2 mins). There are better tooth brushes out there that’s for sure. Too bad. I was happy with it until attempting the change the battery. Had to watch YouTube videos and grab a tool box. Not worth the price when you need to replace the whole thing before it’s time  or use it the same as a nonelectric tooth brush for half it’s life span.
"
"
Excellant toothbrush. Does a spectacular job of cleaning and the vibrations work wonders. However,the battery does not last the intended 3months.im on week 6 and the battery is pretty much dead. Brush twice a day for up to four minutes each time. Still recommend it though. I would purchase again,on sale.
"
"
It might be a little much for a toothbrush, but I like the vibrating option. I have no idea if the vibration actually gives you a deeper clean or if it is a placebo effect; nevertheless, take the batteries out and it is still a great toothbrush.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Have worn out several of these now... Recommended.
"
"
Work as intended
"
"
Very cheap construction, not what I expected. Yes, it is lower priced than most power toothbrushes but I still expected better than this. I'm going back to my regular Oral B power toothbrush with the round head. This looked like it wouldn't last long, not impressed.
"
"
Toothbrush works really great. I give it 4 stars because of the name. Why do they call it 3D white anyway? It sounds like they're trying to stay ""Hip"" and it's not working
"
"
Awesome - simply awesome
"
"
These are wonderful toothbrushes; I am very happy with the purchase in every way.  I'm less happy with Amazon's choice of a HUGE, plasticized, bubble-wrap envelope for the relatively small box of toothbrushes.  My intention for buying these bamboo toothbrushes, while not totally biodegradable because of their nylon bristles, was to REDUCE my plastics use.  So it seems entirely a waste of time when Amazon then ships an ""eco-friendly"" product, itself with zero plastic, in a huge, wasteful bag. Why bubble wrap at all?  A paper envelope, or appropriately sized cardboard box would have been a better and more conscientious, INTELLIGENT choice.
"
"
I like this product. Works as it should. Comfortable to brush with. The only bad thing is the big bubble wrap envelope it is shipped in. It would have been just as easy to tape the end of the box closed and then just put a shipping label on it. We buy products like this to reduce our single use plastic use. So it's a little counter productive.
"
"
These toothbrushes are smaller and lighter than conventional ones but are more maneuverable in the mouth. The shorter soft bristles appear to do as good a job as the longer bristled brushes and are gentler on the gums. Can't comment on longevity of these brushes, as only been using a couple of weeks, but it's nice to know they have a lesser impact on environment than plastic ones.

Petit morceaux de brosse qui se détachent à la première utilisation. Attention pour ne pas les avaler. C'est ma 2e brosse du paquet et les deux ont fait ça.. la première fois le morceau de tige noir et même resté coincé entre deux dents. Le deuxième dans le palais, j'ai failli l'avaler.Small pieces of brush that come off the first time I used it. Be careful not to swallow them. This is my second brush from the package and the two did that .. the first time the piece even got stuck between two teeth. The second, I almost swallowed it.
"
"
I've been using this brand of bamboo toothbrushes for over a year and I love them. They come without plastic (except for some of the amazon packaging, depending on your order, I think) and they are way softer than other ones that I've tried. Sometimes I have one or two individual bristles fall out, but other than that they're great! WAY better than the plastic alternative. I just use pliers to take out the bristles (they aren't compostable) and then compost the bamboo part. I also use the toothbrush as a cleaner after it's been used as a toothbrush to get the most out of them.
"

Ces brosses à dents sont confortables et sont aussi efficaces que d,autres bcp plus chères. Elles offrent en plus la satisfaction e faire un geste pour la planète. Si vous cherchez à conscientiser vos enfants sur l'impact de nos gestes de tous les jours sur l'environnement, c'est un bon moyen!L'emballage est très bien fait et protège les brosses à dent pendant l'expédition. Les délais ont été respectés.

Ever since I heard about how toothbrush handles are non recyclable, I've been looking for bamboo ones. I managed to find two of them (one for me and one for my pup), but that was it. And that was MONTHS (can't even remember how many) ago and I was slowly getting desparate. I was terrified because of the mix of humidity and wood. Finally, I found those and it is amazing. Not only are they better quality than the ones we had before, but there are four of them!! That means that we are set for months and that I don't need to worry about them being made of bamboo!! Plus, those charcoal brushes are soft and feel amazing. This is a forever stable in my book from now on!!
"
"
Great little toothbrushes. I feel the bristles really get into the hardest places. Nice to know they're recyclable.Also great guest toothbrushes.Will be switching over to bamboo toothbrushes for the foreseeable future.
"
"
These are cheaper than any toothbrush I know of (considering you get 5 in there) but that doesn’t mean you sacrifice quality. They’re comfortable, you don’t even realize it’s wood/bamboo in your mouth, and the bristles are softer than I’ve experienced on other charcoal brushes
"
"
The handle and bristles are a little bit rough and sometimes make my mouth a little sore, I also wish the bristles weren't plastic but at least the whole brush isn't. Not perfect but throwing out a hunk of plastic every few months is ridiculous so here we are.

Love these brushes. Quality! The wooden handle does feel a bit strange when in your mouth and brushing as opposed to the usual plastic brushes but you get used to it very quickly. Soft bristles and I like how the brushes are numbered so you don’t have to worry about getting them mixed up with your spouse or kids.
"
"
And I'm happily surprised. They are way nicer than plastic and lightweight. We were a little wary of the 'soft' bristles too, but find they are effective and far nicer on our mouth than the typical toothbrush.While I saw lots of comments on packaging, ours came in recycled cardboard/paper boxes, and individually packaged in the same recycled paper. Easy to recycle the packaging again. Would buy these again - and probably will if they are still available when I need more.
"
"
Great brushes.  I purchased originally as I was cutting back on the plastic used within my home and repurchase because they are great brushes.  Super soft and my teeth feel cleaner after using than with regular tooth brushes from the grocery store.  Win win! :-)
"
"
The bristles are a little soft, but it gets the job done well. I'm happy to have found an eco-friendly tooth brush to reduce the waste I produce. Packaging is recyclable and compostable, which is a huge plus.
"
"
These brushes are great! We're trying to live more zero waste, and these are a great step in that direction, the bristles are really soft on your teeth & gums but still do an A1 job of cleaning! They leave my teeth and mouth feeling really clean, and they're perfect for travelling or camping too! Plus, I love that they're biodegradable!
"
"
I love these toothbrushes, they are great for the environment and do a great job brushing. Soft but not too soft. Gives a good mouth gum and tooth feel after brushing. Longevity is really good. No bristles fall out until at least 3 months or more. Which is about the time you want to change your brush!
"
"
The bristles keep falling out and it's like having a bunch of hair in your mouth. So gross and you have to be careful not to swallow them. I would not buy these again.
"
"
This product is amazing! Love that it’s eco-friendly and also it’s completely the same, if not better, than a regular plastic toothbrush. Only thing I would say is to make sure it’s placed somewhere it can dry fully after use since it is wood and will start to rot. Would definitely recommend/buy again
"
"
I really like these bamboo brushes, very good for the price. The only issue I’ve had is some of the bristles came off in my mouth when I was brushing my teeth. Other than that, they are very good bamboo toothbrushes!
"
"
Good eco-friendly option for those who are looking to reduced their plastic waste output.Soft/medium bristles and a very light, sturdy bamboo body. Low impact packaging. Good value.
"
"
I bought this for my daughter since she wanted an eco-friendly toothbrush. We both tried it and initially it hurt a bit, but after two days it stopped and it was better than our normal toothbrushes! I've used it for about 3 months now and it still works fine! The bristles didn't bend too much and I plan on buying more in the future.
"
"
I have been trying to limit my plastic use, but I am also low-income. This is the perfect option for me. It was a price I could afford, and the toothbrushes work great.
"
"
The dark bristles take some getting used to although they feel wonderful. And the texture of the wood is unusual compared to the standard plastic toothbrushes.
"
"
The bristles keep falling out when I brush! I thought it was just because they were new, but a few days into using them and nope, they're just not that great of quality apparently which is unfortunate because the bristles themselves are really soft.
"
"
Took some getting use to. But now I will not go back to a plastic tooth brush. These work great, last longer then plastic, no lost bristles, soft on gums.
"
"
Super fast delivery. Trying to be more environmentally friendly, and these are simple, but clean your teeth well. I got the sensitive teeth brushes and they didn't hurt my gums. Highly recommend.
"
"
5☆Livraison très rapide, le bois est lisse, les poils sont doux. Cette brosse est beaucoup plus résistante que les brosse ordinaire. Je recommande
"
"
The product is exactly as advertised.  The bristles are soft. The handle is comfortable and doesn't feel like rough wood as I expected. The bristles don't last as long as a normal toothbrush but is be expected. I have used mine for about a month and will need to change it soon. Boyfriend approved.
"
"
Bought these as an alternative for regular disposable brushes. Waste of money in my opinon. The quality is that of a dollar store toothbrush but at 10x the price
"
"
Il faut s’habituer à la texture plus rugueuse qu’une brosse à dents de plastique au niveau de la joue mais produit à la hauteur de mes attentes.
"
"
These are great. They feel like every other tooth brush out there. I really like them. They're comfortable and easy to use.
"
"
C’est ma seconde commande pour ce produit. Je suis très satisfaite. Je trouve pratique que les brosses soient numérotées.
"
"
I bought these to switch from plastic toothbrushes and I love them! the bristles are soft, and honestly I don't even tell the difference with my old toothbrush. It doesn't hold moisture so when I go to use it, it's dry! Packaging is cardboard, so recyclable!
"
"
These are our first bamboo toothbrushes and we love them. Will definitely buy them again. They arrived about 24 hours after I bought them, which is the fastest Amazon delivery ever. We will be buying again (but not too often, as we will use these as long as possible in order to minimize our environmental footprint). Complete success.
"
"
Feels like an average toothbrush, upon the first two brushes i have tried it definitely tints my toothpaste black, but havent noticed any real change in my teeth. Probably best to go with the non-charcoal brushes, but its a good product for what it is.
"
"
Very well made, not as soft as expected.
"
"
I love this product! Very functional and it has nice soft bristles for people with sensitive gums and teeth.. but I wish this also came with medium bristles for my husband. But other than that, I would recommend this to anyone who wants to clean their teeth and save the Earth.
"
"
Took one out to use. There was a splinter that pricked me. Careful inspection is a must
"
"
A good toothbrush. I prefer this to other bamboo brands I purchased which claimed but were not soft bristle. Bristles don't wear out quickly.

Bristles fall out in your mouth while brushing and handle is not very comfortable, head of toothbrush is quite large making it difficult to reach further back
"
"
Nice product for people looking for a more environment friendly option for a toothbrush... just a bit too big as a smaller toothbrush gives you more control while using it.
"
"
Love the fact this is not a plastic toothbrush and the packaging. I was pleased to know it was soft bristles that still work effectively and do a good job.
"
"
Best brushes ever. I will not go back to the plastic brushes. Strong, clean the teeth, and I am so impressed. I should have done this years ago.
"
"
Good toothbrush, works as it should. Bristles soften easily with some warm water. Good product for eco-friendly alternative from plastic brushes
"
"
Wonderful product, very happy with this purchase.
"
"
Love these toothbrushes, A littler firmer then expecting but in love with them. I won't buy plastic ones again.
"
"
Bonnes brosses avec le rapport qualité/prix. Les poils sont ni trop raides, ni trop mous. Le bois de deux des brosses à dents que j’ai commandées s’est effiloché rendant le brossage particulièrement désagréable...
"
"
I like how it’s easy to use, soft bristle brush . Not yet sure how long the bristles will last with 1 use I can see some are already lifted.
"
"
Brisel is too soft but the charcoal works but messy
"
"
Great toothbrushes.  Very pleased.
"
"
La brosse est douce et les poils vont en profondeur entre les dents. Pour moi, le manche plat n'a pas d'importance. Encore mieux car il prend moins de matière pour le fabriquer
"
"
Works just as well as a normal toothbrush. The bristles are a bit long so they kind of hurt my gums, but not so much that I can’t use the toothbrush. Great overall.
"
"
When the handle gets wet it can slip, have hurt my gums a few times because I wasn't paying attention lol!
"
"
The handle is sturdy and the bristles are excellent.
"
"
Convient parfaitement, le prix est super. Recommende à 100%

Great product, great price. Will be repurchasing when I need more

Extremely happy with this purchase !

Exactly what I was hoping for as a first time bamboo toothbrush user.
"
"
Allow yourself a few days to get used to the mouthfeel of this brush. It works great, the brushes are perfect.
"

Great product

Great product, just wish i'd been able to choose between very soft, soft, med etc

Excellent quality! Shipped quickly, and are exactly what I was looking for.

Facile à tenir, douces sur les gencives et semble durable pour le moment.
"
"
No splints or anything. Very good for the environment and your pocket. Soft bristle and strong handle.
"
"
Love that all packaging is cardboard. Super soft bristles which I need because I brush very hard. Pretty affordable as well!
"
"
I love it..
"
"
Nice and soft, but the head of the brush is entirely to large.
"
"
Good quality! Rub coconut oil on them so they're not so dry in your hand.

I like it when a product comes as advertised. Toothbrushes are great, we will order again.

First time trying these. I like them a lot. Definitely would get again

Great brushes, last just as long as regular ones and are biodegradable.

Very satisfied with the product.  Cleans well and sturdy enough.

The product is as it looked online and came very quickly

Very nice brushes with soft bristles.
"
"
They are good
"
"
I bought these before and they are wonderful and great for the environment. I think they are a great price for what you get and I would recommend as I am purchasing for the 2nd time.
"
"
I love everything about these but one thing. The good is the price is great, the packaging and the actual brush is all bio degradable and eco friendly, they are exactly what you are looking for when getting rid of plastic toothbrushes. The only feedback I have is to add one more row of bristles. I find them a bit long and not too wide on the brush. I would rather them be a bit shorter in length and one more row to make the bristle area wider. That would make these perfect and I would buy them forever. That is all thanks for listening to my podcast bye.
"
"
These toothbrushes are gentle on my teeth and gums which is a good thing as I have a very sensitive mouth and have challenges finding a toothbrush that was gentle enough.  I really like the package of four which allows me to switch out the brushes every 3 months without having to re-order one.  The handles are bio-degradable which is also another good feature!  I will buy these again.
"
"
Love these easier on my gums than this store brand and you get enough you don’t feel guilty about changing your brush when your supposed to! Good and sturdy no worries if it will break they are strong! I’m not going back to plastic big 10 for me!
"
"
These are really nice! Really like them. The bamboo is soft and it doesn't fell like you are rubbing wood in your mouth like some others I have tried. Would buy again.
"
"
I loved these bamboo toothbrushes. I ditched plastic toothbrushes a long time ago when I found the bamboo toothbrush. Need to change it after 3 months, so I bought 5 pieces.
"
"
Love that these are individually packaged for guests. I feel like they don’t need to be numbered but that’s no biggie
"
"
Good price for the package. I would prefer a better handle, but still nice to know there is no plastic in there...
"
"
Very soft bristles. Feels great teeth feel clean! Works great! Good for environment the price is good and they are great product. Will buy again!
"
"
J'utilise des brosses à dents souples et celles-ci sont vraiment à mon gout. De plus elles durent beaucoup plus longtemps que ce à quoi je m'attendais.
"
"
et moi aussi. L'emballage est magnifique (on veut le garder pour toujours) et sans plastique (on peut se sentir moralement supérieur).
"
"
Omg incredible brittles and super strong, wont break at all. Amazing buy for sure!
"
"
I  thought the bamboo-part would bug me but I love them.
"
"
I am so happy with these! Thank you
"
"
A great alternative to plastic!

Received the product in 2 days with regular shipping and after a couple of days of use, it is the same feel as a regular toothbrush except with no plastic. Good product!
"

I received a package that is already opened. That is very unsanitary!

- Purchased because my gums began receding -- dentist told me I was brushing too hard! This requires little effort/motion from the user, so it can be basically pushed around the teeth and still feel like you're getting a good clean- Has a timer built in to let you know when you've been scrubbing for two minutes.- Very reasonably priced for a toothbrush and charger combo -- good for those on a budget- Gets those hard-to-reach areas! I have impacted wisdom teeth and don't feel that I can properly clean them with a manual toothbrush; this sets my mind at ease!
"
"
This is awesome! It was my first electric toothbrush ever and it works great! it has a small spinny brush and a brush that goes up and down, so it's about as big as a regular toothbrush, which I like! Also there is a timer which is awesome! My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have! The fact that it's regargeable is good, cause then you don't have to constantly replace the batteries and bring them to the recycling center. I did a lot of research before i bought and this one was recommended along side all the like 100$+ ones!
"
"
Purchased this one for my wife and she is quite pleased with the results. Its quite nice that it has rechargeable options vs the traditional battery powered option. She used this quite a lot and quite aggressively as the brush heads don't seem to last very long. The biggest selling point for me what that the replacement heads on this product are reasonably priced compared to other toothbrush models. Product has nice power to it and charge lasts quite long which surprised us. Would recommend this to anyone who is an aggressive brusher and requires frequent toothbrush head replacements.
"
"
Good bang for your buck in terms of its performance and price. This is my first electric toothbrush, so I do not know what more expensive electric toothbrushes are like, but this one leaves your mouth feeling much cleaner than a manual toothbrush does. It is a very simple product, not too bulky, and takes up little space on the counter. It has just a power button on it and will pulse four times as part of its built-in two-minute timer. It lasts about five days (brushing twice per day) - you will notice when the battery is about to run out as it will become less powerful, eventually stopping. My bones to pick with this product are that it sounds like a power tool (pretty noisy) and that its charge time is very long (16 hours to a full charge).
"
"
received the package  on time. plugged it in and charged as per instructions which was fine, when I used the toothbrush, the bristles are so hard and very hard on my gums.It actually hurts to brush my teeth,  my gums are healthy and I am not pushing hard. Also I believe these toothbrushes were sitting somewhere in a warehouse because when I opened the package there was a coupon for replacement brushes which expired over a year ago.
"
"
HOLD the brush head and glide along your teeth, doing all four ""quadrants"". DON'T ""brush"" like a regular tooth brush. Let this rechargeable and it's brush head do the work for you! Having used the previous generation and this one, there is no difference in performance. Oral-B brush heads fit *all* models including this one. ADVICE: charge completely first; this allows the rechargeable batteries to ""set"" properly. Pay the extra money for the authentic brush heads. In my experience, the bristles are better than the two cheaper knock-offs that I tried. *RECOMMENDED* for a really good and thorough cleaning, as long as you use the built-in timer that lasts two minutes.
"
"
Reasonable price for an electric toothbrush.. cheapest in value I've seen so far.. so I thought i'd give it a try before spending $150 plus on other toothbrushes with mixed reviews... This is the first one I have ever purchased.. I looked through countless reviews on all including the top electric toothbrushes before purchasing this one... including the highest rated/sonic tooth brushes.. all with mixed reviews.. I am very happy with the value of this toothbrush. I can keep it off the charge station for more than a week and it still works great. It is a firm brush so if you have sensitive gums it may give you an issue.. but you should be flossing at least daily anyways... right?! I like the 2 minute timer (brush will stop and buzz a few times.. and then continue) to either remind you... if you zone out in the morning while brushing to STOP.. or make sure to do at least 2 minutes of brushing each time. Charging station is small and fits nice on my counter. Overall happy with the purchase!
"
"
You get your money's worth on this one.  If you are looking for a simple easy to use toothbrush, this is the one you should get.  Plus the replacement heads are far more economical than the competitors.  Yes the competitors are good, but should you be really paying over a $100 just to brush your teeth? C'mon, really?  Another perk is the timer, it makes sure you are brushing for 2 minutes, the recommended time your Dentist suggests.  All in all a good buy, highly recommend this to anyone looking for something not so fancy!
"
"
My teeth genuinely feels more clean now just after using this brush for 7 days. It definately works as advertized. Definately a greqt buy at this price
"
"
I got this for my husband for Christmas (our gifts are so exciting around here!), and it functions well.The battery lasts for many days if he forgets to charge it, and the charger base is easy to use. It doesn't take up a lot of space,  which is a plus.It works well, he got a thumbs up from his dentist last week.It's not too noisy either.

I bought this in sept 2018. Now 5 months later it won’t charge or turn on at all! Extremely disappointed with the quality.
"
"
first one was a single brush, but it did not hold a charge. My wife said she liked it but I bought another one,  the double head for me. It worked great.After charging once to hers about 3 times, she finally said, OK, can I get one like yours. She loved it too. The double brush action feels great on teeth and gums. Dental hygienist says that she could already see the difference.The price was excellent and delivery was phenomenally quick.  I would recommend this to anyone.
"
"
This is the first time I use the electronic toothbrush and i think the oral-B one is the one i want.The battery is not as long-lasting as stated. I have been used it for almost a month and have charged the toothbrush 3 times.I roughly charged the toothbrush once a week. Its brush is softer than I thought (I got sensitive teeth) and I think it is quite soft and clean. Compared to other expensive sonicare / electronic toothbrushs, If you are a new user to electronic toothbrush, I really recommend you to buy the Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean.
"
"
I and my son have been using an Oral B for 8 years and the battery and motor has just started to weaken...damn great for a 15.00 purchase 8 years ago. It has been an excellent product and a great toothbrush, but I thought it was time to get new ones. This new one is even better, stronger motor, easier to remove head for better cleaning, and reaches all corners of my mouth. The 2 minute times is really useful, and the design of the rechargeable base is much better as it's way easier to clean. Love it, hopefully it'll last for at least 3-4 years, though I expect it'll go longer.
"
"
I purchased this on July 17th and it is now dead, less than a year later. It obviously did what it needed to while it lasted, but it got dirty really fast and there was no way of knowing how charged it was. It also died while I was traveling which was super inconvenient because I couldn’t figure out if it was the battery or the fact that I was using an adaptor. It was all very disappointing, would not recommend this one.
"
"
Great toothbrush. I’ve been using it for a while now. Not sure if the spinning really helps in cleaning my teeth. Sometimes I just prefer a regular tooth brush or I leave the motor off. Came with an extra brush head which was useful. Kind of chunky to hold wish the whole decor was a little slimmer
"
"
I always use the rechargeable toothbrush from Oral-B.  They are durable with little maintenance.  And I especially love this brush head as it cleans more thorough.  It would be amazing if I can just buy the brush without the charger.  I already have quite a few of them at home and I always felt it is such a waste to dispose a perfectly fine charger just because I got a new brush but keeping all of them doesn't make any sense.
"
"
Motor is strong. Came with an extra brush head. The charging dock is nice since there is no visible metal that has to connect. Most oral b brush heads should be compatible with this model.However, the Design and color is lacking; I wish they went with a plain black or white finish. I would recommend buying softer brush heads since the default ones are a bit hard and harsh. There is no indication if the battery is running low.
"
"
I've been using the Phillips rechargeable toothbrush for the last 10 years and thought I would give Oral B another try (used it before buying the Phillips). Going back to Phillips once again.I charge my Phillips once every week and the power is amazing. Works so well.I charged it for 24 hours before using the Oral B, and it seems like it needs to be charged again.Power is very poor.Also the brush head is way to large and does not clean well.Very disappointed in Oral B.
"
"
This is my second time ordering this exact same product but my first toothbrush did not have a timer function..  The first time I ordered this toothbrush I was pleased with the length of time needed between charging (3-4 week sometimes) This toothbrush battery seems to be not as good as I have needed to recharge 10-14 days.  I don't think the timer function is necessary...maybe that is what causes the drain on the battery...I liked my old one better.
"
"
Bought this for a family member.  They really liked it so I bought it myself. The dual head does take some getting used to.  I managed to make my gums sore by spending too much time on them. It really cleans my teeth well. It is quite slim-lined too.  I didn't get a cover for the brush head but I had one from an older model.  I think they should include the cover with it.
"
"
I'm loving this!!  Had my electronic Oral B Crossaction for many, many years and figured it was time to upgrade.  I love this toothbrush and especially that's it's rechargeable.  My dentist will love my teeth even more.  Very satisfied.
"
"
Has lasted me already for an entire year! The best part about this electric toothbrush is that after it gets caked on with toothbrush residue its as easily as running it under hot water and soap to wash it all off and make it look brand new again! Definitely recommend!
"
"
This toothbrush is a great product.  I bought it for my guy as a gift as his other more expensive model finally died.  He loves it!  Just shows that price does not always mean better quality!
"
"
I have had this for about a year now and just bought one for my wife (as opposed to swapping heads all the time) given the low cost of the item.  works great, teeth feel polished, timer is a nice feature.
"
"
The actual packaging arrived on time with nice packaging and the item itself works fine. The only thing is that the brush itself is a bit tough and if you have sensitive teeth, you might find it a bit tough. Overall it was a good purchase though and the battery life is good.
"
"
This is my third purchase of this toothbrush. I have used it for years and find it very good especially for the price compared to those in stores for ridiculous prices of up to 200 hundred dollars. This cleans everywhere even the back of your bottom teeth, Battery lasts for several years and can hold a charge for days. Overall I have been very happy with this.. hence my repeat purchases. I would not ever go back to a manual. Replacement heads are easy to find in any store. Good long lasting, powerful and economical toothbrush that still does a great job.
"
"
Excellent product. Works very well. Very simple to handle as well as charge.The only thing I would change is the timer. I would add a sound effect to it as when kids use the toothbrush they notice the difference in the vibration change when it is time to switch to another quadrant.
"
"
I really like this toothbrush! It's pretty basic, as far as electric toothbrushes go, but it's definitely functional! It's got a two minute timer that ends with short burst vibrations. It's super easy to use and it comes with an extra brush head! The only flaw is that I can't tell how full the battery is, or if it is charging when on the charger because there are no indicators of those things.
"
"
Using this for over a year now, works great! My only complaint is that the base gets a little dirty because of how it is shaped, no biggie, just have to wash it every now and then. Bought some after-market replacements heads which work great.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush for my son so that whenever he visits he doesn't have to travel with his charger.  I should add that this toothbrush is an upgrade to the Oral B toothbrush he already has and he's indicated that he might swap them around - i.e. take this newer, better version of the Oral-B toothbrush to his home and bring his older, less efficient one to my home for use during his brief visits.  THAT must mean that he is very pleased with the product and thus I gave it 5 stars.
"
"
Fantastic tooth brush. It works nearly a week long (of brushing 2-3 times/ day) before the next charge is needed.I’ve gotten this tooth brush for many of my loved ones as well because I’m such a fan. They are all very pleased with it !
"
"
Product never worked, dead right out of the box.I opened the package, it said to plug it in for 16h, after 2 days still wouldn't work.  I tried a different outlet, same issue.  I even tried a different charger (my wife has the same unit, she recommended it to me), nothing.  By then I had thrown out the packaging. Not worth the hassle to return it.Garbage.  Buy something else.
"
"
Last almost 1 year. Wont turn/move any more. Thought should last longer than that.
"
"
These work Great No Idea why you want to buy a more expensive one.  My Dentist when cleaning my teeth is like you have hardly any plaque near you gums.  They ask you must be using a powered brush. and yea it does the job.
"
"
Definitely worth the cost. Keeps its charge really well. The timer functions is super helpful. It is a very “rough” tooth brush there is a lot of power to it, if you have a smaller mouth I recommend getting the smaller round head opposed to the dual head. The heads are interchangeable which is great.
"
"
Actually it is a not too bad product considering the price I bought. The biggest downside is that the timer has some problems and cannot automatically shut down by 2 mins, so I always have to turn off by myself. Anyway, the cleaning effect to my teeth is much better than the manual brush, so I still recommend this product.
"
"
GrossGave it 2 weeks but gooy germy  grossness builds up in the little holes and bottom no matter how much you try to dry itIt's HUGE and very uncomfortableDisappointed
"
"
Stopped working after a week. Won't charge. Bad quality. Waste of money.And it's such a genius design that charging only works when it is turned off, while at same time there is no way to tell whether it's turned on when the battery is used up. In other words, you don't know if it is charging at all.
"
"
Surprisingly good for the price! I've had more expensive electric toothbrushes in the past that didn't do the work that this little guy does! If you're looking for an inexpensive model, be it for a child, teen or travel, this is a good bet.
"
"
Bought it for my husband; great quality and has enough, but not excessive, vibration; extra brush.  (Generic Oral B brush replacements that I purchased,  work well with it).
"
"
It's good but there's no light that lights up when you put it on the charger so if it were to break you would only know when picking it up after thinking it's charged
"
"
I have used similar Oral-B products before and have always been happy so far. I have no complaints about this product as far as teeth cleaning goes. The only reason for the 4 rating is because this model lacks a charge status light.
"
"
This is a really good entry level toothbrush. Nothing fancy, it works well and gets the job done. I'm really satisfied with the product and recommend this product to everyone. *Update, after a few months of usage, I am stil lreally satisfied with thsi toothbrush.
"
"
Great! I've been using this exact model for the last 3 years but ever since I moved to Canada from Europe I switched to regular toothbrush.As I re-started using this toothbrush I can already see the difference. Totally recommended!
"
"
Best electric toothbrush I ever used.  My mouth has never felt cleaner.  I absolutely love this one, much better than Phillips in my opinion, and my dentist says she had less scaling and cleaning at my last visit.
"
"
Did a nice job, hold its charge very long, but when you rince the hairs under water, make sure not to let the water drip inside, otherwise it will die.
"
"
Beware. My unit stopped working this past week. It would no longer charge. 5 months almost exactly to the day I purchased it.
"
"
I already have been using the Braun toothbrush for many years but the dual clean is new for me. When I'm finished cleaning my teeth, I feel like I've just had them cleaned at the dentist.

received as promisedHad to ship to an alternate location which is poorcould have shipped to my PO Box but they would not try. was not too large for the PostProduct is super has NMH battery superior to NiCa battery has timer
"
"
First one wasnt starting ans the one I got for replacement cannot hold his charge after 5 months. Waste of money!
"
"
I will never need another toothbrush again found a good deal for the replacement headsc I will never need another toothbrush again found a good deal for the replacement heads great product
"
"
after two months use, battery wont hold a charge.the last one lasted over a yearthere will not be a third one.
"
"
My first brush only lasted a week before it simply wouldn't turn on again; don't know if it or the charger was defective. Thankfully the customer service was great, and a new brush was on it's way to me very quickly. The new brush has been going strong and I think it does a very good job cleaning my teeth.
"
"
I like the brush but the Brissels that came with it were way to hard. Had to order soft heads for it
"
"
The battery in my old one is getting weak and it need to be recharged every 2 days, mind you I had it for a little bit more than 4 yrs.  I just bought another one recently which is on sale for $20 to replace my old one.
"
"
its cheap, works well as a toothbrush and is easy to charge. It is REALLY loud though. Its a good cheap electric toothbrush and the replacement brush heads are not as expensive compared to Sonicare-if you dont mind the noise.
"
"
I have 6 of these, one for each member of the family. I've had to replace 2 already because they stopped charging.
"
"
Only have been using it for a week or so have charged it once already. Works great much stronger than I thought it would be. Leaves teeth feeling very clean. Seems very well made very happy with purchase great price.
"
"
I saved about $15 buying this unit on Amazon versus locally. The only you have to watch is make sure you keep the bottom of the unit dry and clean after brushing as well as the base, so it charges properly. Otherwise it works awesome.
"
"
for someone with a small mouth like me, the head that comes with it is a little too big. Unable to reach my wisdom tooth properly. But other wise, cleans well.
"
"
Nice brush. Has a great cleaning action. Lots of value for money. I was able to put on a generic refill brush too. Only minor gripe is that it doesn't have a charging light.
"
"
Exactly as described. I'm very happy with it! Works really great. Worth every penny and it's so much better than a simple regular brush..In my opinion I feel the difference now.
"
"
je l'ai utilise depuis des mois. aucun problème
"
"
Like the 2  minute  timer  indicator. Battery is strong but discharges sooner than an older model. Cleans teeth well.
"
"
Ce qui me plait, cest que mes gencives ne sirritent pas et ne saignent pas depuis que jutilise ce produit. Cest tres facile a utiliser et la brosse nettoie tres efficacement.
"
"
I was very disappointed with the toothbrush that i got for my boyfriend and it stopped working after around one month. we tried everything and it did not work, stopped charging as well. I paid full price when i got it and it was such a waste!
"
"
Excellent tooth brush.Far superior than regular 2xAA battery versions.You can brush your teeth at least 7 times before having to recharge.
"
"
was really surprised for the price this is a great toothbrush couldnt ask for much more. my teeth havnt felt so clean in a while.really handy charger just drop it on the stand when your done and its always charged and ready. would recomend.
"
"
The toothbrush arrived on the day it was supposed to. The packaging was fine. The battery seems to hold a charge for quite awhile (I can’t keep it plugged in all the time). My teeth feel very clean after brushing.
"
"
Toothbrush is not working even after several hours of charging.
"
"
I was honestly expecting to pay upwards of $100 for an electric toothbrush when I stumbled across this little guy. Works amazingly and my teeth feel so smooth and clean each time. I already purchased 3 for my family. First time electric toothbrush buyer so take it with salt. Would recommend.
"
"
Great Price, and saves time over the ""traditional"" brush... and seems to do a better job...... (ask your hygienist for details). ""Free"" regular tooth brushes from the dentist are fine for travel, but these appliances, which go weeks between charges are safe, and pay dividends.
"
"
Great value for a quality toothbrush.  I switched the larger head out for a smaller brush as it is for my young daughter.  Works beautifully.
"
"
This is my first electrical toothbrush so I'm not sure comparing it to other electrical brushes, but, making the change from a normal one to this was life changing, can't stress enough how much different it feels (In a good way).
"
"
These are great. They really clean your teeth a lot better. I bought one for everyone in the family. The grand kids like it and have less complaining. Even Grandpa like using it. It is a lot faster and they do get a better cleaning. What more can you ask for... no cavities on the next dentist appointment?  :)
"
"
I received the product with some charge, but when I charged the brush it doesn't charge or work. I have left the brush on charging holder for two days and it still doesn't work. Very disappointed!
"
"
Très bonne brosse. Achetée pour remplacer une brosse dont la batterie est fini.
"
"
This electric toothbrush works great.  Lots of power.  I particularly like how long I can use it between charges.  For me it lasts for weeks before having to re-charge.
"
"
Cleans teeth like dentist feel, not to strong and battery last very long time. Came with 2 extra heads, was a nice surprise since there price for replacements.
"
"
Put off buying one for years. Big mistake! Great value and convenient.
"
"
I like it but the timer function seems ton it work. I’m happy it came with extra brush head.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I love it! It lasts for a couple days before needing to be charged and cleans well.
"
"
It's an amazing product, though if I go back I'd buy the 30 second timer instead of 2 minutes. It helps a lot in terms of equally brushing.
"
"
Head spins while the lower bristles move up and down. Base is sleek and doesn’t take up much room. Very happy with the product, especially for the low cost.
"
"
Pros:- easy and fun to use- easy to charge- teeth tingle after brushingCons:Can't think of anything significant but- would be nice with a carry case or something that covers the brush head while packing in a suitcase
"
"
There's a big gap on the body, I'm a bit concerned if this would affect the overall waterproof ability. Otherwise, pretty decent for the price, it's much more affective, but it takes some time to get used to.
"
"
Works very well and after several months of use, it is still working with the original brush head. One charge of the battery easily lasted for 9 days of vacation, although it did slow down a bit.
"
"
For the price, it's quite good at cleaning your teeth. Been using it over 6 months and still works great. Need to change the head, but that's just normal wear and tear.
"
"
Fait un très bon travail mais le modem diffère de l'image.
"
"
Très bonne qualité de brosse à dent.  Très longue durée de vie de la batterie avant de la recharger.
"
"
Bien reçuFonctionne parfaitementSatisfait à 100 pour-cent
"
"
Great product - I even bought the no name replacements and they were much cheaper
"
"
I bought it for my dad and he loves it. He has no complaints, only appreciation for this electric toothbrush. It does a great job and it was worth the money.
"
"
The toothbrush works but it is too harsh in my opinion and the design could improve to be less harsh on teeth.
"
"
Huge improvement from our old Crest Spinbrush electronic brushes. We could feel a huge difference after the first use.
"
"
I find the battery lasts 3-4 days, so it doesn't need to sit on your counter.  Does a thorough cleaning quickly.  Love it
"
"
I have been using this model for a few years. The motor or battery seemed to get a little bit tired (it still lasted well over 5 years) and I had replacement heads so I figured that I should probably buy a new one. At 25$, it was a huge deal. To my amazement, it seems that the model was greatly improved. I just inaugurated it and it was as if a minty tornado of hygiene was decimating an entire population of bacteria under my divine command. Highly recommended.
"
"
Indispensable, je ne peux plus revenir à la brosse à dent manuelle
"
"
Maybe it's a placebo effect or I've just started to clean my teeth better or both! But this toothbrush is seriously making me feel like my teeth are cleaner already. Best investment to date.
"
"
Works great charged it for 12hours and ive been using for almost 2 weeks now and haven't charges it since
"
"
I have always used a manual brush, when I finally decided to make the switch to electric I did not want to deal with replacing the batteries all the time. This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning your teeth, and the rechargeable battery is really handy.
"
"
Works well but hard to find a good deal on brush heads, most are for higher models.
"
"
Great toothbrush and great price! Works well and easy to use. Charges for 16 hours, but the charge holds for at least a week or so. I am very pleased with it. I ordered 3 of them (enough for my family). Thank you!
"
"
Great product. This is the second time buying this. The first one lasted about 2 years...good value for the price and replacement heads are great too
"
"
après 5 ans d'utilisation fonctionne toujours aussi bien!
"
"
Stopped working after one use. Should have paid attention to the reviews stating the same issue. If you're lucky it should work fine. It's a gamble though.Can't recommend.
"
"
Have it for 3 years, still working very well.
"
"
Je n’ai rien d’autre a dire que ca fait très bien le travail.
"
"
First time buying an electric toothbrush and this one is great! Stays charged for more than 10 brushes and comes with one replacement head that I didn't even know about! I can't go back to normal toothbrushes after this.
"
"
My first electric so nothing to compare it to but it does a fine job.
"
"
Itvis an inexpensive functioning product.
"
"
Great.. I just to have 3 differents head for each member of the family but the base is the same.works great
"
"
I find that this toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning and polishing my teeth. It kind of "" stalls"" momentarily when you reach the end of two minutes. So you know how long you should be brushing. I wish I'd had this toothbrush years ago.
"
"
Great clean with minimal effort. Too bad it stopper working after a full charge and first use
"
"
This device is comfortable to hold and easy to control when brushing.
"
"
perfect toothbrush, everything you want from a basic electric brush, and you can't beat the price. It holds the charge from 5-7 days and comes with a few replaceable heads
"
"
Love this toothbrush. Never had an electric on before..Works very well. Could probably use it to debark trees if I had to too :)
"
"
Never used an electric toothbrush before.  The dental assistant recommended this brand. You can feel the difference.
"
"
Brosse à dents recommandée par mon dentiste. Elle est parfaite et à un très bon prix.
"
"
La livraison a été très rapide étant donner la période des fêtes, la brosse nettoie bien, bonne emballage.Merci
"
"
After 2 weeks of use the battery already dying.The headbrush is too big to clean far side teeth.
"
"
Donne l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste après l'avoir utilisé tellement elle nettoie bien!
"
"
Very goodHighly recommendedOrdering for the whole family
"
"
My first E-brush and it great, happy to have this to help me take care of my teeth.
"
"
Thought it was a great basic electric toothbrush. Unfortunately, the low price is in part due to a cheap battery that dies before you can finish brushing after owning for 6 months. If you don't want to purchase twice a year, it might be worthwhile to switch to another product.
"
"
It works as advertised. It certainly is 'energetic' and noisy compared with a unit purchased a few years ago. On balance it delivers good value for the money.
"
"
There are better options available.
"
"
Best bang for your buck. I purchased another one after mine to give as a birthday gift. They travel well without the charger base and the battery holds. No point spending more money on the really expensive ones, these are just as good.
"
"
Well built. A little pricey
"
"
Great toothbrush, does the job, comes with extra brush (6 month use total) Has the timer function which is cool too. Fast shipping
"
"
Fait la job. 🙀 Pas cher.
"
"
Cette brosse à dents est parfaite.
"
"
Cant go wrong for the price
"
"
Great Product... Specially for the price... Cant beat it.... I never liked the idea of an electric toothbrush... but once you try you'll never go back to manual.... Mouth feels cleaner then ever!!!!
"
"
Good toothbrush, battery life is good and does what it should
"
"
delivered prior to promise date.  If you were buying this off the shelf, it would be for a medium mouth, not small.
"
"
Bought for daughter. She didn’t like it.
"
"
Very very good product
"
"
What more can I say. It's an electric toothbrush and does its job. Get ut
"
"
This works great, my teeth feel very clean. The only thing is that it does not hold charge for very long. Maybe 3-4 days using twice daily.
"
"
Got it on sale and sure happy I bought it.  Cleans well and I like that it doesn't turn off once the two minutes are up like my expensive one did.  The head is a little bigger but I like it.
"
"
Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric ToothbrushDecided to switch over to electric toothbrushes, it worked fine for the first two days. I had charged it twice and it stopped working ever since.
"
"
Still don’t know how to use the timer but the battery life is great and gives a good clean.
"
"
plaisant pour les dents nettoie parfaitement.
"
"
Great tooth brush
"
"
Title says it all
"
"
For a truly clean mouth and teeth, it sure does the job.  I love it.
"
"
In the words of Larry David. Pretty good, pretty, pretty, pretty....pretty good.
"
"
Good product, delivered in timeBetter than manual toothbrush.
"
"
Cheap and effective electric toothbrush. The timer is a nice feature.Remember to charge it first when you take it out of the packaging.
"
"
Bought for my my extra needs son.  It has improved his teeth cleaning ability, helping in his ability to be more independant.
"
"
This is a great intro into electric toothbrushes. But after a few years the battery and motor will show their age. Great for a kid or to test out if electric brushes are right for you!
"
"
I had the same model for many years, figure will buy a new one even so old one was still working fine.
"
"
Really good for the price. Efficient, battery last enough, easy to clean. No complaints so far after 3 month
"
"
Value for money indeed but the rpm is quite low I feel, and battery life is not very good. There's hardly any life left after brushing 1time (2mins)
"
"
Wife loves it
"
"
Bought this item in april 2018 and it is still working fine. I really like this brush, though its not super powerful. So if you want powerful "" beast"" its better to buy more expensive models.
"
"
does what its suppose to
"
"
Great brush, charge lasts a long time, however the tips are not very soft and I will have to purchase softer ones to be comfortable.
"
"
Great idea, makes you brush longer and feels like it does make a difference.  Rechargeable and easy to charge/use.  Good Value!
"
"
Je suis très satisfais .
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent, par contre elle vibre pas mal fortViens avec des coupons rabais mais ils sont EXPIRÉS!
"
"
very good
"
"
The dentist keeps complimenting me about my teeth, it can only be due to this toothbrush!
"
"
Brush is amazing but bristles are not good enough to last a month long. Rest is best
"
"
I enjoy the price of this product. I really don't understand how there are models in the 100s, meanwhile this tooth brush as the major essentials that do the job.
"
"
It's a great toothbrush. However, a light indicating the brush is charging or low battery would have been nice...
"
"
One of my best investments. The dual clean makes a difference in comparison with a regular toothbrush. Needs a recharge every 2-3 days.
"
"
A single charge last for several days. Instantly have noticed cleaner teeth.
"
"
Thanks!
"
"
Works great Price was good. Came with an extra head and took not to long to get a full charge.
"
"
Love how it let's you know when it's been 2 minutes! Brush works great and holds a charge for multiple brushes
"
"
Best gift I ever bought myself, then went and bought my daughters one as well..great product, amazing price. Thank you
"
"
Great! Good price too!
"
"
Works well as advertised.
"
"
Not as powerful as I expected.  Kind of on par with the battery operated brushes at the drugstore which are much cheaper.
"
"
Great
"
"
Excellente !! Super achat
"
"
J'adore ma nouvelle brosse à dent qui fait un très bon travail qualité prix.
"
"
Great charging system, just place in holder.
"
"
Great.  Very effective. Only downside is replacement heads can be expensive. And there is no warning when battery about to die / needs charging
"
"
Conforme
"
"
The electrical brush is a good improvement from a regular one. It is working as intended and now I am brushing me teeth for 2 min or so rather than the 30 seconds I used to.
"
"
I like the two different brush heads, although it’s a bit loud
"
"
Good deal
"
"
A l air super comme produit
"
"
Excellent produit
"
"
Works super ! I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I have nothing bad to say ! I recommend
"
"
For price how can you go wrong
"
"
Bought 3 and all functioned perfectly
"
"
Brushes your teeth.  I find it does a way better job then my old manual brushes did.  Would buy again
"
"
Does the job
"
"
price was good, and purchased to augment existing unit
"
"
I've had this for almost 2 years and have never had a problem! Works great!
"
"
the bristles should be little bit soft and flexible too harsh on the gums the speed should be little bit less
"
"
Battery doesn’t work for long. I regret purchasing.
"
"
Very efficient teeth cleening, you don't need to put it on the charge every day. I would say every 5 days when you use it twice a day.
"
"
I never used an electric toothbrush before and was pleasantly surprised when I tried this one. Does a good job and makes brushing the teeth kind of fun!
"
"
full charge lasts around 5 times of brushing. Otherwise function as described
"
"
Too bad it does not have a charger signal...so i never know when it is actually charging
"
"
Super appareil. Son seul défaut est de laisser sa base de recharge sale : l'eau s'accumule dessus avec les bactéries associées.
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush.
"
"
Luke it
"
"
I love it
"
"
Works great .
"
"
Best electric toothbrush I ever brought.
"
"
Great unit - feels like I just left the dentist after every brushing.
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dents. Bon prix. Livraison rapide!
"
"
Great product and price. Has a lot of power and leaves you with that clean teeth feel.Highly recommended.
"
"
Works great , and I hope it lasts as long as the Oral-B products I have used
"
"
Great electric toothbrush for the price. Everybody should have one. My teeth are much cleaner.Some people recommand/prefer the round tip than the dual one, but I don't see/have any problem using the dual one until now.
"
"
It does a very good job and small enough for my small mouth.
"
"
I bought it when it is on sale, as my first electrical toothbrush. The quality is good and shipping is fast. It is a good choice as an entry-level electrical toothbrush.
"
"
Still using it 2 years later!
"
"
Works great. Definitely  does a better job  than  regular  tooth  brush.
"
"
i’m very satisfied with product
"
"
I got this around christmas for $18. Works very well. Still going strong after over a month of use. Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
Love the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes,  my teeth feel so clean!My hygienist recommends using an electric toothbrush, had my last one for nine years, believe it or not.
"
"
Battery lasts 1 day only. Got replacement and same issue. Needs to be charging all the time.
"
"
I use it daily . Its the only brand that i trust. It has a two minute timer and lets you know with a vibration that your two min is up  .. nice
"
"
Great tooth brush
"
"
As headline
"
"
As expected
"
"
I love everything about this!
"
"
Love it works fine
"
"
Great quality for the price!
"
"
Bought to replace old electric toothbrush. lives up to my expectations.
"
"
Très satisfait. IL est préférable d'acheter d'autres brosses car elles perdent beaucoup leurs poils. Sinon A1!
"
"
Battery driven power toothbrushes do not do the job this robust Dual Clean brush can do.  Even my hygienist notices the improvements.  Buy it for superior dental health
"
"
Cleans anything accumulated. food, dust, mud, you name it. Satisfied after a year!
"
"
Good
"
"
The perfect little electric toothbrush, it's all I need.  And shipping was fast!
"
"
Gave me a fresh just out of the dental clinic feeling.  Neat wireless charging station that I didn't expect.
"
"
I have purchased one about a month ago, ended buying a second one because the wife kept stealing it.
"
"
Très bonne mais t'est mieux d'acheter les têtes d'origine
"
"
Works as expected and described
"
"
Ma fille aime beaucoup
"
"
ok. the charger gets slower after every use. needs improvement... a little disapointed.
"
"
Powerful and reliable.
"
"
My son loves it. It's easier to use than a regular tooth brush & cleans better too.
"
"
Satisfied with this purchase works great for the price
"
"
I like it, good product👍
"
"
Does the job it was intended for.
"
"
Works great, love the timer, lasts about 1 year.
"
"
Works great! Good coverage over teeth, reduces the amount of effort I take in brushing my teeth
"
"
works well
"
"
Works great
"
"
Le temps de 2 minutes est long pour les jeunes enfants.
"
"
You can’t go wrong with it
"
"
Great price.  Love it
"
"
perfect for my family's need. why buy expensive stuff when this can already do the things an expensive electric toothbrush can..
"
"
Had one before liked it so I saw this on sale and bought it.
"
"
Very happy with it. My teeth have never been cleaner. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap electric brush. Comes with two brush heads.
"
"
As advertised.  Pleased with the item.
"
"
excellent
"
"
bon produit
"
"
Best price and quality. I go through one of these maybe every 3 years, and it's usually after a few accidental drops. Excellent brush.
"
"
Arrived on time. Works perfectly. Good brush.
"
"
Cleans teeth well and holds a good charge.
"
"
3rd one I got, I love them and  the dentist  does also
"
"
One full unit stopped working after less then two months. Now I'm sharing mine with my wife.....not what we had in mind!...
"
"
Not bad. Does the job. May find it for cheaper at walmart.
"
"
New and works perfect
"
"
❤
"
"
Bought one for everyone in the family.
"
"
Minimum footprint, does the job, even shuts off automatically when put back on the recharger. What more can you ask of a toothbrush?!?
"
"
And the two minute timer is appreciated to make sure I brush long enough.  Works less forcefully if left off the charger for a few days (obviously), so as long as you keep it on the charger full-time it's great.
"
"
Très bien pour le prix. Je ne regrette pas mon achat
"
"
Really great gift for your significant other.
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Good
"
"
I like this toothbrush very much, it does an excellent job of brushing,light weight easy to use very good product
"
"
I love it
"
"
vraiment une belle brosse, semble parfaite,
"
"
Very good buy
"
"
Works great, but not quite as nice as the professional series. Still worth the money.
"
"
I  really  love  it!  Makes  your  teeth  feel  so  clean  and  whiter.
"
"
Seems to work well, has more power than the previous model I had. The spare heads from my previous one also work on it fortunately.
"
"
Each time I use this toothbrush I end up with a bristle in my mouth. They come off very easily. I do not recommend.
"
"
très bon rapport qualité/prix, très satisfait
"
"
I got this on sale for like $8 and it's amazing.  Such a good brush for that price.  I highly recommend the brush if you can get it at or near the same price I did!
"
"
Everything that I have bought from Amazon has been great. the only thing that gave me problems was the Belt for my phone and things I found it was to small for my stuff..I gave it to my grand daughter and she uses it for small shoppkins toys,so all is good.Thank you.
"
"
So good I bought two.
"
"
this is a piece of junk  don t waste your money
"
"
It works better than my original brush
"
"
Very good quality!
"
"
Good product. Works well
"
"
I use this product to brush my teeth obviously.  Works well
"
"
Works great, my mouth seems and feels much cleaner compared to manual brushing!
"
"
I have been using this for many months now. Love it still. The brush heads are a bit expensive but I love the toothbrush.. Works great.
"
"
Works fine , been using it for over a month .You can leave it plugged at all times, won't damage & battery works a fairly long time .Great buy
"
"
Really good and soft brush
"
"
Really cleans teeth well. Every night I use it and you can actually see the difference.
"
"
Absolutely perfect! Got zero issues with it
"
"
Great value. Charge lasts days. Would buy again. (Have recommendedto friends.)
"
"
I like it very much it gets areas of my teeth that the manual toothbrush does not get
"
"
Great brush for the price been using it for a month now and is perfect
"
"
This product is definitely worth it.
"
"
This is the second one I've owned, the last one lasted years. It just slowly started to lose it's stength in the last 2 years. The new one has tons of power and considering the price, it's a great value. Definitely recommend!
"
"
Great product
"
"
It's okay. The battery don't last too long, have to charge it regularly.
"
"
Arrived quickly and is exactly as promised.
"
"
Really great quality! You can see very quick results.
"
"
Still working after more than a year... Underwater. Being recharged again and again. Does its job very well everyday! Timer is helpful too
"
"
merci amazon pour cette brosse a dent je l adore ces super ,
"
"
Works well, but is noisy.
"
"
On the first time it worked just fine but after that it kept dying after 30 sec of use
"
"
👍
"
"
Seriously works great, never bought a more expensive electric toothbrush so I can't compare, but with these I might never have to. Last one I bought lasted around 5 years before the battery started being weaker and I decided to replace it.
"
"
Works well
"
"
Love it
"
"
Husband loves it
"
"
Acceptable
"
"
Love
"
"
Great product
"
"
Exceedes my expectation in every way I could think of. Good job Oral B !
"
"
Love it
"
"
Cleans great.
"
"
This Oral-B rechargeable works as well as the Philips Sonicare at a 3rd of the price. Great deal fast shipping with Prime.
"
"
I am very satisfied of my New Electric toothbrush. It is right on Whats  i expected to be!  👍
"
"
Pretty reliable electric toothbrush.
"
"
good value, does the job.
"
"
I'm a very hard person to please and this product has met my standards.The reviews are legit, dont think and just buy.
"
"
great product works fine
"
"
Great rechargeable toothbrush, but the head is way too big to properly brush. Would recommend the small circular one.
"
"
Great deal
"
"
Best brush ever
"
"
Product works good very pleased
"
"
Perfect use, small portable charger, came really quickly (much to my surprise) and I enjoy the speed that it works at for brushing.
"
"
Ok
"
"
Works great good price

"
"
I love it.  My teeth have never felt so clean!
"
"
Not intended for gentle teeth and sensitive gums.First few times I had an impression that I am going to get a concussion lol
"
"
Excellent product. It cleans the teeth ten times more than cleaning with regular toothbrush.
"
"
It's not the same as the pics
"
"
This is a great product, and you can always depend on AMAZON.
"
"
very good
"

"
"
It's is great product. Would recommend it to everyone
"
"
An old electric toothbrush's battery died.  It was back to manual brushing till I came across this.  Oral-B has a great product here!
"
"
I did love this toothbrush, but after only 7 months it doesn't charge anymore. Contemplating a different brand for the next time. :(
"
"
Thourough cleaning-you will not find a better electric toothbrush than this
"
"
Does not work anymore...up to you to decide if one year is enough of a life span for this.
"
"
Works great no issues here.
"
"
Good toothbrush.  Easy to clean and the charge lasts.
"
"
Works as well as more expensive brushes
"
"
Works well, very happy.
"
"
Love it, especially the interchangeable head.
"
"

"
"
La brosse à dent a fonctionné 6 mois seulement. Je vais tenter d'obtenir un remboursement de la part d'Amazon.
"
"
I always use oral B and it works well. Don’t really find anything unsatisfying
"
"
I recommende that toothbrush to everyone.Easy to use, stay rechargeable long term, fast, good clean etc etc Very satisfy
"
"
I will update if anything changes but perfect so far.

"
"
Never know when charging is done!
"
"
Works great
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I am loving it so far. My brushing was never easier and what was once a painful ordeal is now a refreshing experience.It was particularly satisfying that I was able to get it for under $20. And, it comes with a spare brushhead.
"
"
I am happy with the Braun toothbrush as I previously had one and was very satisfied with it..David B.
"
"
Easy to use. I feel it does a good job, much better than the one it replaced. I have no problem recommending it as a good buy.
"
"
great product
"
"

Works great!The toothbruch is a bit bulky and awkward at first, but you get used to the feel.

used for years and still using it without any issue. very solid products!
"

Great product. Timely delivery.

Good unit, just have to use the smaller head brush.

Great electric toothbrush for the money
"
"

"
"
Very very good product. Cleans your teeth really well
"

"
What a positive difference a quality toothbrush makes!
"
"
good quality, shopping on time
"
"
Came quick great product
"
"
Good product. Cheaper than buying local
"
"
Disappointed.  Works slowly, not as fast as the one it was replacing.  Single speed instead of dual speed.
"
"
Teeth feel clean , like you went to the dentist.
"
"
I find the head large & took awhile to get use to.
"
"
Très satisfaite. Merci
"

So good! Honestly can never go back to a regular toothbrush... best 18 dollars i’ve ever spent

I got this electrical toothbrush on sale, having always used manual brushes in the past. I didn't think there would be much difference, but WOW was I wrong! This thing honestly leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist office for a routine clean! Really fresh, able to reach all my teeth with ease, powerful. The charge lasts a pretty long time (I brush 2-3 times a day & have it 'plugged in' almost all the time after using, so it never really 'runs out'). It came with some replacement heads for changing in 3 months time, which is a nice bonus.The only downside is the brush heads don't come with any type of 'cover' or 'cap' for storage/after-use. It would be great if they added something like that in the pack, but you can find some covers/caps on Amazon for cheap.Overall 5/5 - I recommend this toothbrush to all my friends & family (many have actually bought it too)
"
"
I absolutely love this tooth brush.  It is hard to imagine going back to a manual brush.  The brushes that come with this brush *are too large for me.* Not so large that they do not fit in my mouth but they trigger a gag reflex.  Anticipating this I paired the Vitality with Oral-b ""sensitive brush heads.""  The small size of the sensitive brushes reduces my gag reflex.  The brush is very effective and has provided countless ""after the dentist"" cleanings.  The battery lasts for about 5-7 days.  This depends on whether you brush for 2 minutes, as recommended, or longer.  Overall I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in better oral health.  The downside is the large (for me), included brush head.
"
"
Exceeded my expectations! I've used the regular Oral B for years. I switched to the Oral B Vitality  and I am amazed how much cleaner my teethe and mouth feel! My only misgiving is that the cheaper replacement heads that are NOT genuine ORAL B Vitality, will fall short of my expectations. From past experience, the regular Oral B heads exceeded the performance and durability of the less expensive substitutes! I personally feel that AMAZON should withdraw selling cheaper inexpensive substitutes! They invariably work out to be more expensive in the long run!
"
"
This rechargeable electric toothbrush has a single on/off switch and sits on a flat surface on the charger. The surface is easier to clean than the older model. It has excellent vibration and cleans teeth effectively. Price is cheaper than what I bought my first Oral-B Electric Toothbrush.
"
"
This toothbrush performs well, holds charge for longer than previous models, and is very effective. I liked that it came with an extra brush head. Excellect value.
"
"
Just can't beat the value of this product on sale at $21.99. This is my first electric toothbrush and I would have converted long ago had I known just how good they have become. Good quality construction with a soft rubber gripper on base. Two minute timer made me realize I was not brushing long enough with my old toothbrush. I'm very impressed with length of time between charges, 4-5 days. It's light and has a small charger stand so it's good for the traveller. You wouldn't even need the charger for short trips. I now enjoy brushing my teeth as it gets to hard to reach places with ease. I would rank this as one of my best valued items I've purchased from Amazon.
"
"
My old one quit working some time ago and I was pleased to find this one.  My vanity is small and this fits perfectly next to the regular toothbrush holder.
"
"
Recharges and brushes well. My only complaint, as some others have mentioned, is the lack of a recharging light: you can't tell if it's actually recharging or not, so you just have to assume it is. Still, a minor issue.
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush, I like the built-in 2 minute timer.The heads seems to be a little expensive but I've had it for a month now and the unit itself seems pretty solid.The only issue I had was when it ran out of battery life (after using it for a week without changing it). It dies quickly and without warning. Like its working 100% and then mid brush boom 0%. Changed it up again and it was back to 100%. So just something to be mindful of.
"
"
Parfait. Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Meilleur prix qu'en pharmacie. Offrez-vous ce cadeau. Avoir su, jaurai jeté ma brosse à dent manuel bien avant ! Seul bémol, la charge; il faut là charger environ 16 heures pour 30 Minutes d'utilisation , et rien n'indique quand elle doit être rechargée.
"
"
Fisrt time shoppong in amazon.ca and got so disappointed. It's only half a month and this electric toothbrush stopped working! No matter how I tried, the engine cannot start again.
"
"
Good toothbrush for the price. Initially I thought it wouldn't hold a charge, but turned out to be an issue with my bathroom outlet. My biggest complaint is that it has a serious design flaw where your saliva and plaque can leak into the handle. I clean it frequently but I wish I didn't have to.
"
"
I'd been using a more expensive Oral-B toothbrush that has lasted since around 2009-2010; for instance, it had the ability to display when it was charging and to time brushing of the teeth into 30 second intervals. When that brush died after what I'd consider a ton of use, I decided to go with a cheaper replacement that didn't have those extras, but which what I thought was the same model as one that my wife has used regularly for years without issue. The difference is that the charger that came with mine has already failed within six months of use. It's clearly a different design and one that apparently has more durability than the one I got. I haven't looked into whether they have a replacement charger available, but I'm pretty unhappy that I have to even bother looking this soon.
"
"
a good little toothbrush, but i have to change batteries every 2 months. it could also have a bit more power in the brush movement. doesn't take up a lot of room on the bathroom sink. a bit tricky to change the batteries, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.
"
"
I bought two products. Those were defective. I sent them back to you. I want my deliveries soundly. Is it possible? Do you have a solid product that works?I sent it back to you on two defective products.Are you still sending back the new ones?When do you think to send it back?This is your 6th message.
"

i charge it long time , but i can not use during 3 minute, it is a big issue for the power charging
"

My dentist recently suggest I use an electric toothbrush, since they're more accurate and reliable than manual brushing (hands down).This meets my needs and then some. It has a built in timer that changes how the brush rotates for a few seconds; the purpose is to inform you that you've been brushing for 2 minutes and should stop now. The brush stays clean, since I rinse the head while it's still turned on for a second.At some point you will have to buy replacements, but manual brushes have the same problem. Dental hygiene is hella worth the effort and money, jaw pain /bad cavities are unbearable!

Went to France with our new toothbrush and it died on us despite having the right adaptor and voltage regulator.
"
"
Battery life is not great
"
"
Great price.
"
"
The battery of the product stop charging in a month after i purchased from this store. The product itself was actually produced in 2011, which is beyond its original warranty cover rage. ;(
"
"
Vibration is too strong for sensitive teeth.
"
"
it is my first time to try electric brush, so far so good!
"
"
Pros:-There's a timer that indicates when 2 minutes are over-Easy to clean-The color of the brush head fades which makes it easy to determine when to change it-My teeth feel really clean after every use-Provided with an extra brush head in the packageCons:-Not operated by battery. If I plan to travel outside of Canada, the country I will go to might not use the same charging outlet. So, I will have to purchase a special charging outlet.-Does not have a storage containerTo be frank, if I ever have to buy a toothbrush to a friend or loved one, I would definitely choose this one. Although it has ONLY two disadvantages, it's still effective in delivering a healthy and clean smile!!

I would never buy this Oral B electric toothbrush again, as it failed after 3 months and that is disgusting.It still makes a tiny sound, but forget abt actually doing a brushing job.OralB should be ashamed to make such a defective product!
"
"
I have never really used any other more expensive power brushes so I can't really compare it to those. But compared to a manual brush this is a game changer. Your teeth will feel way cleaner. The battery is very strong too, the first Vitality I had lasted 7 years before the battery stopped holding a charge.
"
"
The battery on this lasts forever.  It states to drain the battery every 6 months.  It took a full week of using it twice a day.  Charges very quickly and works extremely well.
"
"
I've had this for several months now, and it works great. However I haven't been to the dentist yet so we'll see what he says when I get a check up. I find this much more convenient than a manual toothbrush. I only need to charge it once a week. I'll update after I have talked to my dentist.
"
"
LOVE it!  funny story.. I thought my old one was dying but ends up outlet breaker had popped.. but I'm very glad i got this one with timer.. who knew 2 minutes was so long.. haha.
"
"
Works well, and is easy to use. It would be nice if it included speech synthesis so that people who have a vision impairment could use it more easily and independently.
"
"
My teeth have never felt so clean!  For the value it is a great product, especially coming with a replacement head at the start.  It cleans deeply but isn't too hard on the gums.  I don't know why it took me so long to get one.  I won't be going back to the manual toothbrush.
"
"
Works well. I like the 2 min timer. Low cost, works well, teeth feels clean and feels like a proper brushing.
"
"
This is the best!
"
"
Great product and fast prime shipping. Love it
"
"
Pretty good. But before power off, there is no indication and completely doesn't work. I have another type from Oral-B, before power off, the light is flash and can still use for another 1-2 minutes, so at least you can finish the brush for this time and then charge the power for next time.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Teeth feel really clean when done brushing them.  Nice price.  Satisfied with purchase.
"
"
Love it! Exactly what I was looking for and a great price point.
"
"
lower brush head broken, but as tooth brush this is a fantastic product. will order some more brush heads.
"
"
just what we wanted, no bells and whistles just an excellent product at a very good price
"
"
Perfect, very powerful and great for clean teeth. Cheap for an electronic toothbrush
"
"
Works great.  exactly as described.  would buy it again.
"
"
Works well,Very good quality!
"
"
Very great product
"
"
Excellent toothbrush that may save your gums from rotting into oblivion. When I first switched from manual to electric, it felt like a sanding belt inside your mouth - tearing off that gunk that sits there after a full hearted meal. I personally use the sensitive brush heads since they are smaller and cause less gag.The battery on this model typically lasts around two weeks without recharging, but the effectiveness of the whirl will reduce with each brush because it's spinning slower as the battery drains.Would recommend this for anyone who wants to keep their teeth.
"
"
Good little brush.
"
"
Bought for my wife.  She raves about it and reminds me often
"
"
Very satisfied.
"
"
Very good product
"
"
Very good, cleaning teeth becomes so easy at home!
"
"
Item as described.  Can't go wrong with Oral B!
"
"
It is worth buying,I appreciated it
"
"
Good!
"
"
Pretty good and as same as the description. Yet, the light indicator for charging is not obvious.
"
"
Excellent product at a very good price.
"
"
Useful, and the price is really acceptable
"
"
Super!
"
"
Good product
"
"
Great value. Excellent service.
"
"
Love it! But maybe too much larger than normal ones
"
"
Perfect. A reasonable price. I love it!
"
"
I bought this for my daughter.I bought myself a high end Oral B for almost $150. This comes with the same charger, and extra brush head also. I could have saved a lot of money just buying one of these for me. This works great. My daughter has adjusted to the 2 minute brush time - this does a good job of warning you when it's time. Im giving this 5 stars because compared to the expensive kits, this works just as well, without the fancy bells and whistles.
"
"
I'm pleasantly surprised at how well this gadget works.  I bought it because my dentist told me I was brushing my teeth with too much force, causing my gums to thin.  The Oral-B Vitality saves me from having to use any pressure at all, since it's the one doing all the work.  I just have to move it across my teeth.  The built-in two-minute alert is a nice feature, though I'm guessing I've been under-brushing for much of my adult life because the two minutes sometimes feel subjectively longer than from before I had the device.The best thing I can say about the Oral-B Vitality is that, after I've finished using it, it's like my teeth and gums have just had a massage session.  My mouth feels clean, fresh, and pampered!P.S. I'm subtracting one star from my review because the packaging was designed by sadists.  Seriously, there are so many layers of plastic that have to be cut with scissors (there are no snap-apart sections), I almost cut myself several times on sharp plastic edges just removing the package contents.  I thought this kind of wasteful, frustrating, and dangerous packaging was a thing of the past!

After trying a few brushes, I haven't left this one.Most brushes have a single action - spinning, or vibrating up and down.  This is one of the few brushes that has both and boy does it make a difference.Comes with a rechargeable battery, and a recharging base. Heads are replaceable.  Simple one button operation, even has a timer ""buzz"" to let you know when you have  brushed long enough.My favourite part, I can get 20 heads for $15.99, bringing down the cost of ownership on these to next to nothing, and helping ensure low dentist bills at the same time.MaxAike1 Generic Oral-B Braun Vitality EB417 EB/SB-417 Dual Clean Toothbrush Heads (20 PCS)
"
"
One of the better sub $35 brushes out there.Has a very nice non slip grip,soft on and off switch,not too big.The charging base could be a bit larger though it tends to tip easily if touched but cord is very long.The head bristles itself has dual action cleaning which is great,for first time users it may feel strange but after a few uses you get use to it.Cleaning itself it is very good since it can get into the nooks and tight spaces without fear of brushing too hard and cause bleeding.Settings is basic 2 minute timer which is the normal time needed for a good brushing.There are lots of more expensive brushes out there that has lots of settings, sleeker looking with anti bacteria UV lighting but if you want a basic dependable brush with affordable replacement brushes this is a great  product.

"
I had bought the older model of this same toothbrush 4-5 years ago but the battery died recently. Since it was a very good toothbrush and the lifespan/price ratio was really good too i bought this new model. But I was baffled by the quality and the power of this one. At full charge the power of this one feels like when the battery on the older was about to be out of charge. And the feel of it seems of the build seem much more sketchy/cheap.
"
"
This was my first electric toothbrush, and I'm happy with it. It's a simple brush, easy to clean and the timer is really helpful for making me brush for the full 2 minutes every time. It's easy to clean since the brush itself is waterproof, so I wash it with soap and water and wipe down the brush head as well. I charge it overnight about once a week for twice daily use. You definitely feel the difference when the battery starts to die down a bit, so charging it twice per week or leaving it on the charger would be the best option.
"
"
I bought this for my spouse.  The toothbrush is great looking and well made.  My disappointment is that, unlike the one I had bought long ago for myself, two key features are missing.  There is no indicator to tell you that the battery is close to exhausted and the unit needs charging.  And there is no indicator light to tell you the battery is fully charged,
"
"
I bought this electric brush for my kid to help with the teeth brushing routine, as the battery operated ones had lost their luster.I was reluctant at first to buy, I was concerned of how it would compare to the one I purchased for around $100.The differences I noted are:No timer that vibrates to tell you you've brushed long enough,& it does not have the red light to tell you to release pressure.Other than that, its very similar.Like on mine, I changed the head to a smaller one.(its compatible with other Oral B rotating heads.)I am very satisfied with the purchase. My kid is happy to have an electric tooth brush, and she loves to brush her teeth and I don't have to keep pushing for action!
"
"
Cheap and effective electric toothbrush. Nothing fancy, just basic and that's what I like.The dual brush head might be feel a little awkward and a little too big, but I got used to it after a week's use.Two minute timer works as expected.One thing I found odd is even after I thoroughly rise the tooth brush and dry it after use, I still notice soap residue drying up on the base after a few days. Needs to be constantly cleaned.
"
"
It’s a great powerful toothbrush. The heads that come with it (2 of them) are comparable to a soft medium. I wish the battery lasted longer because I don’t leave it sitting out. I get around 3 days, brushing twice for 2 minutes before it dies without much notice. The price is great though, and I recommend it for a cheaper alternative to the pricier models.
"
"
I've been purchasing oral b rechargeable electric brushes as gifts for family and friends.  At first they are insulted or think it's a joke, but not soon after they praise them as their best gift. It's cheap, effective and impresses  my dentist during annual visits. I've had mine for years and I bought this second one for my winter home.
"
"
Je ne regrette pas mon achat !! Brosse à dents très efficace grâce à sa double tête rotative. Je suis allée faire un détartrage il y a un peu plus de deux mois et j’ai l’impression que c’était hier, la plaque dentaire n’adhère pas tellement la brosse à dents est efficace par rapport à la brosse à dents classique ! Je suis ravie d’avoir opté pour cette brosse à dent électrique
"
"
I am very pleased with this battery powered toothbrush. I initally bought a sonic style but found that the high frequency vibration caused a 'tickling' sensation in my mouth which I couldn't stand. I then bought this brush and have been very happy with it.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush of my own. I have used a manual battery operated brush and tried my husbands basic electric. This one is by far the best. My husband is upgrading his. Very low noise yet powerful motor. Holds a good solid charge. Relatively lightweight.Update: This is a 2nd purchase and it is the updated model. Works perfectly. Battery life is very good. The first one I bought is still going strong. Won't use any other brand or type
"
"
This toothbrush has a strong motor and a decent battery life per charge, maybe up to a week depending on usage. At the 2 min mark, it does a double pause to let you know, feels like battery was about to die at first. It feels light and durable, and should last reasonably long for the price. I'm happy with this purchase and it's way better than the battery operated brushes.
"
"
Overall a good product. No 30-second warning for each quadrant of your teeth. It didn't stop after two minutes of brushing, but did vibrate at that point so you have the choice to continue brushing or stop. The replacement brushes are quite pricey. There is a $10 coupon if you register, but it won't allow Canadian customers to complete the registration because you cannot input Canadian provinces. This offer is a farce. So one star deduction here and another deduction for the brushes.
"
"
I don't need a super fancy toothbrush, this one checks all the right boxes. Affordable, easy to find replacement heads, battery lasts. I don't need bluetooth on my toothbrush (or even a timer for that matter) and this is perfect.
"
"
Love this brush. Works great. The timer helps alot. I dont bleed like I did with regular brushes from brushing too hard. It kinds does everything for you, you just have to maneuver it. Kind of loud but doesnt bother me.
"
"
Better than even our older Oral-B's.  Love this brand when we wanted to get a set for our Muskoka mobile home did not hesitate and they did not disappoint.  They clean so much better than manual brush.
"
"
A lot more powerful than I originally anticipated. Left my mouth and teeth feeling far better over a manual brush.Rated 4/5 because although it works fabulously, you can see in the pictures that the bottom of the toothbrush where the charging hole is that there's no locking mechanism in place so it feels kinda loose and has play when it's sitting on the charger, giving me the impression that it's not charging but I verified that it does charge.Other than that, it's great and I recommend it to anyone looking for something that will work hard on the teeth.Also great that that they have different heads for different people which although I haven't tried, I'm sure they work just as good.
"
"
How did I live without this toothbrush before?! Great speed and pressure. Timer is appropriate. Comfortable. The dual toothbrush heads are the best, but rather expensive. Singles work fine though. Would buy this again.
"
"
Great product. Works and clean well. Charge in one night and still working after one week of brushing. Easy to replace the head. I tried a couple of them over the year (Phillips,Sonic...) and this one is my favourite to date. Comes with one extra head (total two).
"
"
This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I am very glad I bought it.  The best feature for me is that it alerts you after 2 minutes that you have brushed enough--otherwise I would stand there all day.  Good price, good job--couldn't ask for anything more.May 5 2015.  Well, it lasted almost exactly 1 year.  I liked it so much I bought another one to replace it.  Should it have lasted more than a year?
"
"
Best bang for your buck. Its the cheapest yet most effective toothbrush out there. If you don't need all those gimmicks like a screen or brushing hardness sensors, then this is the one for you. It has that 2 minute timer which is the only feature you really need (depending on your dental circumstances of course).Brush heads I replace ~1x/4 months, and are relatively cheap to replace. For long trips (more than a few days) I would bring the charger with me. I find that after the 2nd day without charging it causes the strength of the motor to get weaker.
"
"
This toothbrush is amazing it is so powerful and cleans great. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth under 2mins even before the time kicks in.I have an older Oral-B that I replaced with this one and it is 100 times better. I highly recommend this brush, it is a dual clean so a bit big if you have a small mouth. My wife does not like it she would prefer a smaller brush but it is great for me.
"
"
The brush is very big and takes getting used to, compared to my old one it has fewer features. The timer only tells you when two minuets are up, not the four notices which let you decide the time equally on the diferent parts of your mouth. It has no flashing red light to warn you to recharge, it has no light to tell you it is charging, it is an oversized stripped down version of the old rechargeable.M
"
"
This toothbrush seems like it should cost more than it did. It cleans my teeth very well, and it feels like a high quality product. The charging base is a smooth plastic with a slightly concave shape, making it very easy to occasionally rinse off any toothpaste residue that runs down the toothbrush. The battery life seems to be pretty good (I've taken it for a weekend trip without the base), but I normally just leave it plugged in
"
"
I had a similar brush before this - the Oral B CrossAction Pro. The brush heads looked almost identical, but this brush is much more gentle on the teeth and gums while still thoroughly cleaning my teeth. It feels smoother as well and cleans up well. The built-in timer is very handy as well as it is very easy to lose track of how long I have been brushing. This is a very good toothbrush and you can't beat the price!
"
"
The batteries aren't serviceable by the consumer. That's intentional.. crappy environmental policy.I changed my review because the seller was great and I didn't understand how reviews should work.To;Dr: everything is the same as you'd get in a store, the planned obsolescence is just goofy for brand loyalty
"
"
I bought them for my kids and they work great.  I already had one myself so I knew to expect a better brushing compared to a manual toothbrush.  Replacement brushes can be expensive.
"
"
Very happy with this product, especially that I bought is when it was on sale. It is the third I buy and the first two have lasted a very long time. It keeps the charge for at least three full power, full duration brushes. I keep it charging all the time.
"
"
I actually bought this for my boyfriend to replace his electric toothbrush that had broken, and I loved it SO MUCH, I went out and bought one for myself too! It's not high tech, so it's not hard to use, and it definitely feels better than using a normal toothbrush. Several weeks in, my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter!
"
"
I couldn't believe the difference in cleaning power between this and my older model Oral-B. The brushing action (and the brush style) are superb in comparison. I now look more attractive than ever.
"
"
Bought this as my old Oral B was starting to ""Act Up"" & glad I did. this 1 is More Powerful & came with 2 Dual Heads as advertised. Plus my Extra Dual heads from my Old Oral B fit the New 1 Perfectly, which was a pleasant surprise.
"
"
I have used 3 different Oral-B toothbrushes and they are all great.  I especially like the small round head that is easy to maneuver in my mouth, battery life is long and it is easy to clean.
"
"
I was reluctant to purchase this product but I am presently surprised by how thorough it is and I am recommending this product to anyone looking for a great product.
"
"
Best value electric toothbrush. You can even get cheaper brush heads on amazon as well. My preferred toothbrush for the past 5 years.
"
"
This a great tooth brush. My first one I had for 10 years. It was a rechargable one and it still runs except the moving parts are waring out to the point that they pinch my lips. That's why I have ordered this one also I enjoy the timer on it. It is also quiter than my old one and i think it is faster also. great brush and good ordering service thank you.
"
"
this is an excellent toothbrush! Especially if you get it on the sale price. It is pretty much everything you want in an electric toothbrush. Don't waste your money on one of those spin brushes that take batteries the handy little charger keeps us toothbrush ready at all times.This is a definitely must get you don't need to think twice just purchase.
"
"
First time using electric tooth brush. I was sold. So much better than manual one, Easy to use, cleans my teeth much better and I don,t have to brush hard anymore so my sensitive teeth are gone. Besides it is fun to brush. Lastly if you suffer from aching hand, I will recommend switching to a electric one.
"
"
I have been using this tooth brush for over 4 months now and do not have any issues with it. It works well and I love the clean feel it leaves on my teeth. Overall it is a good product at an excellent price.
"
"
My second toothbrush. I have one and also gifted one to a friend because I was so impressed by the size and easy handling. I have had mine for a year and it is still working as if still new.
"
"
It processes a timer, I see the word timer but don't  know how to activate or led lights?No indication of weak charge and no indication it's charging or completed charge.
"
"
The timer feature is easy to use, and the battery life is incredible. I have gone about 3 days without charging this toothbrush and it still worked! I really recommend this.
"
"
Leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner than conventional brushing. If your teeth are sensitive, the vibration can be a little bothersome.
"
"
The difference between this and a manual toothbrush is day and night. Cleans between teeth and gums extremely well and leaves your mouth feeling so fresh after. The price dropped significantly since I bought it (last week), and I will be buying some more for gifts.
"
"
We liked this fine until it stopped charging. we ordered the extra brushes as well..now we,have many brushes and no charger.  Very disappointing.
"
"
I very happy my old one bit the dust . Like this one alot. Like a going through a. Car wash for your mouth love it the best .
"
"
Very pleased with this item. Espcially because it is on the low end of electric toothbrushes. I have never used electric but I love it. It is very powerful but my teeth have never felt cleaner!
"
"
The brush it came with was very hard on my sensitive teeth but when I switched it out for a softer brush it was great.
"
"
Works well, my teeth feel very clean.The vibration for the 2 minute mark was alarming. I just assumed the toothbrush would turn off, instead it is a series of vibrations.
"
"
j'en ai trois pareilles avec des têtes différentes. À 29.99$, c'est un peu moins cher que dans les magasins.
"
"
After long-term use of this product I have to lower the rating. This toothbrush is just too hard on the gums. It's excellent at cleaning teeth, but be careful it doesn't wear away your gums. Just had a teeth cleaning and they warned me about wearing my gums.
"
"
Great toothbrush, comes with one replacement.  About a 10 day charge to it.  Cleans up well.  I am having a hard time finding the double heads from replacement.
"
"
I chose this one after doing significant research on brushes in this price range.  Arrived to our address in the GTA within days of ordering, excellent product.  Girlfriend was using an Oral B Pro before this, and she likes this better.  Good seller
"
"
Works great, and the price is definitely more doable than the other electric brushes! As for the brush head, I'd rather go for one with a single rotaring unit instead. With the dual clean brush head, the bottom part just gets in the way.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush! Ordered because I needed a new toothbrush and this one had an awesome 20 dollar coupon so why not?! Super fast delivery and the toothbrush works amazing. I love that I can get a good quality electric without breaking the bank. This one does the trick for me, and really like the 2 min sensor it gives off.
"
"
I bought this to replace my old one of the same model.  I have had this just over one month and I already have to charge it every day.  It's a dud and too late to return it.
"
"
I first bought one of these for my husband.  After almost 2 years it's still working great, so I decided to order one for myself. This is an awesome toothbrush.  I highly recommend it.  I bought a cheap one before and it didn't last a year.  Don't buy a generic brand.  Trust in Oral B.
"
"
My Dentist is happy I bought this. You can feel that it's not playing around when it comes to cleaning your teeth, it applies some serious action!!I found that getting use to the round shape of the brush handle required some practice. Seems like a well made product. Shipping was fast, as well.
"
"
I quite love this product. I thought I was cleaning my teeth well before with a manual brush but boy was I wrong! This was recommended to me by my dentist because I have deep grooves in my cusps. The timer is a wonderful thing and my teeth are actually a couple of shades whiter. I'm never going back to manual!
"
"
This toothbrush is great. It is very affordable, which originally drew me to purchase it. The charging system is easy to use and the toothbrush is easy to use as well. Once you press the button, it automatically starts a timer and then makes a distinct vibration pattern to signify to you when it has been two minutes.
"
"
Use it daily.. pretty good .. I was lazy at manual brush, couldn’t brush my teeth for more than 10 seconds... so my dentist recommended this to me and now I only use electric brushes .. does a good job
"
"
I have had these for about 3 months and it stopped working.So the quality is not the best.It was working great a first.
"
"
My teeth used to be brown, green, and falling out.  Now they're sparkling clean white like a move star and not falling out. Absolute magic.
"
"
This is a replacement after using for many years.  I have always been satisfied and would highly recommend it.
"
"
It is what I wanted and I find it cleans better than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Used the brush a lot when it worked, Battery suddenly failed after 6 months.... Unable to recharge it
"
"
Has been working well. It's much better than manually brushing with a regular toothbrush. Doesn't need to recharge often - I charge mine once a week. You can tell when it's low on battery because it vibrates weaker compared to after it has been fully charged.
"
"
It's here to kick plaque and chew bubble gum... And it's all out of bubble gum....
"
"
Attention, le fil électrique à la base n'est pas étanche... pas évident pour la salle de bain! Moi, j'ai mis de la colle chaude pour rendre le joint étanche. Le mononc' est content.
"
"
This tooth brush is AWESOME ! For the price its an absolute STEAL ! My teeth feel way cleaner, and are noticeably whiter. For the price it is really a NO BRAINER. Solid product. Replacement heads are a bit costly, but never the less, great buy !
"
"
This seems to work well. I got it for my 14 year old son. Little loud, but he likes to use it to brush his teeth.
"
"
I'm not a big fan of this toothbrush. it doesn't clean the teeth very well
"
"
I love that it has a 2 minute timer while brushing.  I charged it for 24 hours before using it and it stayed charged for 5 days before I plugged it in again.  It cleans my teeth really well.
"
"
This is a really solid toothbrush and worth the purchase, cleans my teeth better than my pathetic non robot hands could.
"
"
I have used the Vitality for years. Way cheaper than the other Oral B toothbrushes but works just as well.
"
"
The two brush heads a game changer.  They are wonderful.  Will hacpve to ditch the one heads on hand.
"
"
Excellent product. Oral-B makes some of the best products I would say. Always try to buy the best for my family. Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush
"
"
I had the older one that lasted over 5 years and this is an improvement. Mt dentist is happier as well.
"
"
This toothbrush is very loud. It vibrates so intensely it hurts my mouth. It has also pinched my tongue and inside of my cheeks. I would not recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
Good buy！Cheap and works well! No need for any extra functions like what other 'high-end' models have, as I barely would need to use these extras...Simple is the best
"
"
Man for $30 CND this is an excellent brush, waterproof design, good performance, teeth feel polished all day. Big fan, best move i ever made moving from manual.
"
"
Only been a few weeks but overall I am very happy!
"
"
This rechargeable toothbrush satisfies all our requirements. It functions very well and is very stable on its stand while recharging.
"
"
Delighted I found a match to the one I have that's about to die. Expect this one will be every bit as good as the one it's replacing.
"
"
So far it works! Cleans them teeth up nicely. Yet to charge it so ill update with how long the rechargable battery lasts.
"
"
Works really well. The charging is really fast and stays charged for days. Come with an extra attachment.  Worth the money.
"
"
Bought these for my finacè and she absolutely love it. It’s easy to hold and does a thorough job in cleaning out your teeth. The timer feature is an added bonus. For the price and quality of the product, I definitely recommend.
"
"
Works great, my dentist loves that I'm using this one. Apparently, it's her favourite brand as well.
"
"
Simple, works well, appears well made.  Would buy again
"
"
Only had it for a couple of weeks.Impressed with power and speed. Seems well made.Hopefully it will last as long as my last Oral.B vitality.Definately buy again.
"
"
After having an electric toothbrush for years when I was young, I used manual tooth brushes for the past several years. I decided to switch after my dentist recommended going electric. So far it's been amazing. My mouth seems way fresher after every brush and the built in 2min timer is a nice added bonus!
"
"
This is such a great product for the price. Been using it for over 6 months and have absolutely 0 complaints
"
"
I love how easy it is to charge it with the provided base. Great toothbrush. You can feel the clean.
"
"
Feels like you just stepped out of your dentist's office. A must for all bathrooms
"
"
Not the one pictured. Was sent an older cheaper model
"
"
Arriving and responded to the complaint was perfect, I had tried two of them but they did not working properly and the battery would not last even for a minute, despite of charging enough.
"
"
Excellent does nice jobGood value

This is my second set (I also bought my fiance one, and she bought one for her mother). Highly recommended.
"
"
This toothbrush works great.  It cleans the teeth much better than a manual toothbrush.  The price is reasonable.  I'm happy with this purchase.
"
"
Bonne brosse à dents..... Mon garçon l'aime bien
"
"
Acheté ce produit en février 2019. La pile ne tient plus sa charge. Après une charge, la bosse ne fonctionne que pour une vingtaine de secondes.
"
"
Great value, good performance, still use it after 2 years. The first e-brush I had from Oral B laster 13 years. Yeah, this company produces durable, good working oral tools, which are totally waterproof.
"
"
Easy to use, just as expected. I find the turning noise to be louder than I expected. Overall, still great product for price.
"
"
Only thing I’m not happy with is that the $3.00 off coupon for replacement brush heads expired in 2018....
"
"
Brush is a good deal, and it works well, though replacement heads can be expensive - the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. The previous one I owned lasted about ten years, before the battery gave out.
"
"
Been using this product since August. First few full charges worked great and lasted the length they’re supposed to. A month later it cant hold a charge long enough for me to brush my teeth.
"
"
La troisième en 20 ans.
"
"
This tooth brush works very good. I would buy it again.
"
"
Everything works except for one major flaw. After one year the toothbrush becomes moldy.
"
"
Not as much as a savings as I thought it would be, cost in store not much more.  It's a grade lower than my last toothbrush.  I think my next one I will kick it up back up to the ""oral B"" like I had before.  OK but not more.
"
"
No problems with this product works great, a great basic electric tooth brush.
"
"
Don't need a $200 toothbrush, this works fine and has been going strong for over a year now.
"
"
One of the best electric toothbrushes I ever bought.  Dual action is amazing
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Works well and I love the new larger brush head.
"
"
Still holds a great charge. Works with a variety of value brush heads as well.
"
"
Kids love it
"
"
This is the most effective, less pricing toothbrush I had.  Cannot think of getting anything else than this one.  I recommend it all the way.
"
"
Works well.  I like the timer feature.
"
"
The first Vitality Oral-B I bought was made in Germany this one was made in Mexico the first purred this one is as noisy as a dentist's drill
"
"
The battery is amazing for me and i feel like its doing a really great and thorough job in brushing my teeth, leaving them like i just went to the dentist :) + you cant go wrong with the price !
"
"
Great quality and great price hold charge for a while
"
"
good and battery last and do a better job then a regular tooth brush
"
"
Cleans my teeth very well and its nice to have that little 2 min. reminder
"
"
Perfect Tooth brush, love it, has a chargeable stand and you can replace the heads
"
"
Not me I have one that plugs in
"
"
nice and easy to use. good cleaning job
"
"
Nothing bad about it, amazing price for what you get. Its sturdy and its very powerful, and considering a decent toothbrush costs around 12 bucks this thing is a steal. My teeth have never looked better.
"
"
So  far so good, only had it for a week, I can feel the difference between toothbrush & this Electric Toothbrush.  Recommend to everyone.  If I have any problems down the road I will update info.
"
"
My dentist suggested I get this and I finally did. Works great and I love the two minute timer! Comes with a replacement head too, which is really nice
"
"
Works great, even comes with an extra head!
"
"
Best toothbrush EVERRRR!!!My teeth feel so clean and smooth.It's like getting that after the dentist visit feeling every time you brush.
"
"
Good bruch, has it for awhile now, no issues.
"
"
For the price this brush is worth every penny glad I picked it.
"
"
Does the job.Battery has good autonomy.
"
"
Bought for a client and seems to be doing a good job and working alright.
"
"
eletrc toothbrush is with a charger ,no batteries needed
"
"
Great electric toothbrush, that is really affordable
"
"
Very good electric toothbrush. Cleans very well and the fact it's rechargeable, it means there is no more batteries to buy. The timer is very practical. I really like it.
"
"
so far so good
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Works fine, good quality for price
"
"
Son enjoys brushing his teeth with the electric toothbrush.  Ideal that it is rechargable and not battery operated.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush
"
"
Produit de très bonne qualité
"
"
Bought to replace my existing Oral B cordless toothbrush.  This one is much louder and the bristle seem more stiff on my sensitive teeth.The price was reasonable as I bought it on sale.
"
"
Too big for mouth and noisy
"
"
A bit more vigorous action than my Philips but the head is quite large.  When the 2 supplied heads are replaced it will be with the smaller size.  I found the on-off switch to be unusually hard to press.  A very good value overall.
"
"
La brosse va bien mais j’en prefere le bout round seulement
"
"
I bought this item as a Christmas present for my wife. She uses it daily and loves it.
"
"
Good product for the price, I'm very satisfied. I'm not a fan of the dual action part but the heads are interchangeable so it's not a real issue.
"
"
Both of us are very pleased with the performance of these toothbrushes...
"
"
Great product! Battery lasts very long! Will definitely purchase again!
"
"
Love it! Purchased 2 of these one for me and one for my wife. Cleans very good and easy to use - love the timer function.
"
"
Meilleur prix trouvé !Cette brosse à dent est vraiment génial je ne pourrait pas m'en passer
"
"
I bought this toothbrush back in December of 2013. One of the brush heads broke on me, but maybe expected after 5 months of use!  Haven't had any other issues with this toothbrush.
"
"
ORALB Vitality Electric Toothbrush is a powerful electric toothbrush for a reasonable price.
"
"
Great price , great product .
"
"
Great toothbrush you can feel the difference after you brush.. And comes with two heads perfect for me and the girlfriend
"
"
For the price, you can't go wrong! Love it!
"
"
Good, nice price, nice quality
"
"
Great toothbrush. Lots of power and does a great cleaning job
"
"
I had an oralB model that was a few years old, cost 5x as much, and broke down. When it came to replace it, I found this one. It costs way less, and does exactly what I used my fancy model for, but without all the bells and whistles. Works great.
"
"
Only lasts for 3 months and its dead
"
"
I like it. works great just like my other one
"
"
arrive on time.  product always hard to get out of package.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien
"
"
It's great. Does what you want it to & does it well. Recommended.
"
"
Great price, great product and quick delivery.
"
"
Easy to use. Efficient. Economical. No complaints.
"
"
Great price and excellent toothbrush
"
"
What can I say... it's a Braun!  My third and my teeth and gums feel nice and clean.
"
"
Great brush
"
"
Très bonne fonction comme on s'attendait.
"
"
Never going back to a regular brush, would like a longer battery life though.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush for the price! Much more powerful than the battery operated toothbrushes. No need to spend more.
"
"
The best toothbrush , period !
"
"
Great product.. Stays charged all the time..
"
"
Just what I needed! Used this for two weeks and my dentist even noticed a difference!
"
"
Bought this electric tooth brush to replace my old one that was over 5 years old. The battery in my old one was just too weak, the new one is awesome!
"
"
This toothbrush is easy to use, love the timer feature. It is light and the battery lasts about a week. Great value for the price!
"
"
Good product but the vibration isn't as good as it used to be after a year
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. Good power, easy to use (well its a toothbrush), timer is nice, recharge base is also nice... nothing to complaint about for now.Probably one of the best quality/price electric toothbrush
"
"
Bought this for my husband and he loves it! I wanted to know if he would like an electric toothbrush before I spend hundreds on them.
"
"
Works as it should.
"
"
Good
"
"
It is very good at what it is supposed to do  clean your teeth but you have to use it
"
"
Je suis très satisfait de mon achat.
"
"
Worth the money spent.Does pretty well..what its supposed to do.The only concern is the cost of brush heads.
"
"
Great toothbrush for a great price. So much better than a manual toothbrush and cleans much better. Good product, would recommend.
"
"
Stopped working 3 days in had to return. It was great while it worked though
"
"
excellent toothbrush.
"
"
good
"
"
Lost charger and can't use now.  Would prefer a bullt in chageable batterylworked great until needed recharging.
"
"
Everything went smooth, works and as described
"
"
Happy with this especially for the price.  You can use other heads which we are happy about as we are using for our child.
"
"
Like it so far. It was my first electric toothbrush. Found the head a little big, but get use to it now. The charge last. For 20$ it worth it! Love the 2mins timer.
"
"
This took me a couple of days to get used to and now I absolutely love it! My mouth feels so clean all the time.
"
"
The Oral-B arrived on time and the product works much better than the older unit I was currently using.
"
"
WE werent brushing our teeth often before buying those, but since, we brush more often and longer. So i guess it helped
"
"
Excellent produit livraison rapide
"
"
This is useful and it work well.
"
"
I've used these for years. Forgot mine when I left a hotel, glad amazon can ship them out quickly!
"
"
- Purchased because my gums began receding -- dentist told me I was brushing too hard! This requires little effort/motion from the user, so it can be basically pushed around the teeth and still feel like you're getting a good clean- Has a timer built in to let you know when you've been scrubbing for two minutes.- Very reasonably priced for a toothbrush and charger combo -- good for those on a budget- Gets those hard-to-reach areas! I have impacted wisdom teeth and don't feel that I can properly clean them with a manual toothbrush; this sets my mind at ease!
"
"
This is awesome! It was my first electric toothbrush ever and it works great! it has a small spinny brush and a brush that goes up and down, so it's about as big as a regular toothbrush, which I like! Also there is a timer which is awesome! My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have! The fact that it's regargeable is good, cause then you don't have to constantly replace the batteries and bring them to the recycling center. I did a lot of research before i bought and this one was recommended along side all the like 100$+ ones!
"
"
Purchased this one for my wife and she is quite pleased with the results. Its quite nice that it has rechargeable options vs the traditional battery powered option. She used this quite a lot and quite aggressively as the brush heads don't seem to last very long. The biggest selling point for me what that the replacement heads on this product are reasonably priced compared to other toothbrush models. Product has nice power to it and charge lasts quite long which surprised us. Would recommend this to anyone who is an aggressive brusher and requires frequent toothbrush head replacements.
"
"
Good bang for your buck in terms of its performance and price. This is my first electric toothbrush, so I do not know what more expensive electric toothbrushes are like, but this one leaves your mouth feeling much cleaner than a manual toothbrush does. It is a very simple product, not too bulky, and takes up little space on the counter. It has just a power button on it and will pulse four times as part of its built-in two-minute timer. It lasts about five days (brushing twice per day) - you will notice when the battery is about to run out as it will become less powerful, eventually stopping. My bones to pick with this product are that it sounds like a power tool (pretty noisy) and that its charge time is very long (16 hours to a full charge).
"
"
received the package  on time. plugged it in and charged as per instructions which was fine, when I used the toothbrush, the bristles are so hard and very hard on my gums.It actually hurts to brush my teeth,  my gums are healthy and I am not pushing hard. Also I believe these toothbrushes were sitting somewhere in a warehouse because when I opened the package there was a coupon for replacement brushes which expired over a year ago.
"
"
HOLD the brush head and glide along your teeth, doing all four ""quadrants"". DON'T ""brush"" like a regular tooth brush. Let this rechargeable and it's brush head do the work for you! Having used the previous generation and this one, there is no difference in performance. Oral-B brush heads fit *all* models including this one. ADVICE: charge completely first; this allows the rechargeable batteries to ""set"" properly. Pay the extra money for the authentic brush heads. In my experience, the bristles are better than the two cheaper knock-offs that I tried. *RECOMMENDED* for a really good and thorough cleaning, as long as you use the built-in timer that lasts two minutes.
"
"
Reasonable price for an electric toothbrush.. cheapest in value I've seen so far.. so I thought i'd give it a try before spending $150 plus on other toothbrushes with mixed reviews... This is the first one I have ever purchased.. I looked through countless reviews on all including the top electric toothbrushes before purchasing this one... including the highest rated/sonic tooth brushes.. all with mixed reviews.. I am very happy with the value of this toothbrush. I can keep it off the charge station for more than a week and it still works great. It is a firm brush so if you have sensitive gums it may give you an issue.. but you should be flossing at least daily anyways... right?! I like the 2 minute timer (brush will stop and buzz a few times.. and then continue) to either remind you... if you zone out in the morning while brushing to STOP.. or make sure to do at least 2 minutes of brushing each time. Charging station is small and fits nice on my counter. Overall happy with the purchase!
"
"
You get your money's worth on this one.  If you are looking for a simple easy to use toothbrush, this is the one you should get.  Plus the replacement heads are far more economical than the competitors.  Yes the competitors are good, but should you be really paying over a $100 just to brush your teeth? C'mon, really?  Another perk is the timer, it makes sure you are brushing for 2 minutes, the recommended time your Dentist suggests.  All in all a good buy, highly recommend this to anyone looking for something not so fancy!
"
"
My teeth genuinely feels more clean now just after using this brush for 7 days. It definately works as advertized. Definately a greqt buy at this price
"
"
I got this for my husband for Christmas (our gifts are so exciting around here!), and it functions well.The battery lasts for many days if he forgets to charge it, and the charger base is easy to use. It doesn't take up a lot of space,  which is a plus.It works well, he got a thumbs up from his dentist last week.It's not too noisy either.

I bought this in sept 2018. Now 5 months later it won’t charge or turn on at all! Extremely disappointed with the quality.
"
"
first one was a single brush, but it did not hold a charge. My wife said she liked it but I bought another one,  the double head for me. It worked great.After charging once to hers about 3 times, she finally said, OK, can I get one like yours. She loved it too. The double brush action feels great on teeth and gums. Dental hygienist says that she could already see the difference.The price was excellent and delivery was phenomenally quick.  I would recommend this to anyone.
"
"
This is the first time I use the electronic toothbrush and i think the oral-B one is the one i want.The battery is not as long-lasting as stated. I have been used it for almost a month and have charged the toothbrush 3 times.I roughly charged the toothbrush once a week. Its brush is softer than I thought (I got sensitive teeth) and I think it is quite soft and clean. Compared to other expensive sonicare / electronic toothbrushs, If you are a new user to electronic toothbrush, I really recommend you to buy the Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean.
"
"
I and my son have been using an Oral B for 8 years and the battery and motor has just started to weaken...damn great for a 15.00 purchase 8 years ago. It has been an excellent product and a great toothbrush, but I thought it was time to get new ones. This new one is even better, stronger motor, easier to remove head for better cleaning, and reaches all corners of my mouth. The 2 minute times is really useful, and the design of the rechargeable base is much better as it's way easier to clean. Love it, hopefully it'll last for at least 3-4 years, though I expect it'll go longer.
"
"
I purchased this on July 17th and it is now dead, less than a year later. It obviously did what it needed to while it lasted, but it got dirty really fast and there was no way of knowing how charged it was. It also died while I was traveling which was super inconvenient because I couldn’t figure out if it was the battery or the fact that I was using an adaptor. It was all very disappointing, would not recommend this one.
"
"
Great toothbrush. I’ve been using it for a while now. Not sure if the spinning really helps in cleaning my teeth. Sometimes I just prefer a regular tooth brush or I leave the motor off. Came with an extra brush head which was useful. Kind of chunky to hold wish the whole decor was a little slimmer
"
"
I always use the rechargeable toothbrush from Oral-B.  They are durable with little maintenance.  And I especially love this brush head as it cleans more thorough.  It would be amazing if I can just buy the brush without the charger.  I already have quite a few of them at home and I always felt it is such a waste to dispose a perfectly fine charger just because I got a new brush but keeping all of them doesn't make any sense.
"
"
Motor is strong. Came with an extra brush head. The charging dock is nice since there is no visible metal that has to connect. Most oral b brush heads should be compatible with this model.However, the Design and color is lacking; I wish they went with a plain black or white finish. I would recommend buying softer brush heads since the default ones are a bit hard and harsh. There is no indication if the battery is running low.
"
"
I've been using the Phillips rechargeable toothbrush for the last 10 years and thought I would give Oral B another try (used it before buying the Phillips). Going back to Phillips once again.I charge my Phillips once every week and the power is amazing. Works so well.I charged it for 24 hours before using the Oral B, and it seems like it needs to be charged again.Power is very poor.Also the brush head is way to large and does not clean well.Very disappointed in Oral B.
"
"
This is my second time ordering this exact same product but my first toothbrush did not have a timer function..  The first time I ordered this toothbrush I was pleased with the length of time needed between charging (3-4 week sometimes) This toothbrush battery seems to be not as good as I have needed to recharge 10-14 days.  I don't think the timer function is necessary...maybe that is what causes the drain on the battery...I liked my old one better.
"
"
Bought this for a family member.  They really liked it so I bought it myself. The dual head does take some getting used to.  I managed to make my gums sore by spending too much time on them. It really cleans my teeth well. It is quite slim-lined too.  I didn't get a cover for the brush head but I had one from an older model.  I think they should include the cover with it.
"
"
I'm loving this!!  Had my electronic Oral B Crossaction for many, many years and figured it was time to upgrade.  I love this toothbrush and especially that's it's rechargeable.  My dentist will love my teeth even more.  Very satisfied.
"
"
Has lasted me already for an entire year! The best part about this electric toothbrush is that after it gets caked on with toothbrush residue its as easily as running it under hot water and soap to wash it all off and make it look brand new again! Definitely recommend!
"
"
This toothbrush is a great product.  I bought it for my guy as a gift as his other more expensive model finally died.  He loves it!  Just shows that price does not always mean better quality!
"
"
I have had this for about a year now and just bought one for my wife (as opposed to swapping heads all the time) given the low cost of the item.  works great, teeth feel polished, timer is a nice feature.
"
"
The actual packaging arrived on time with nice packaging and the item itself works fine. The only thing is that the brush itself is a bit tough and if you have sensitive teeth, you might find it a bit tough. Overall it was a good purchase though and the battery life is good.
"
"
This is my third purchase of this toothbrush. I have used it for years and find it very good especially for the price compared to those in stores for ridiculous prices of up to 200 hundred dollars. This cleans everywhere even the back of your bottom teeth, Battery lasts for several years and can hold a charge for days. Overall I have been very happy with this.. hence my repeat purchases. I would not ever go back to a manual. Replacement heads are easy to find in any store. Good long lasting, powerful and economical toothbrush that still does a great job.
"
"
Excellent product. Works very well. Very simple to handle as well as charge.The only thing I would change is the timer. I would add a sound effect to it as when kids use the toothbrush they notice the difference in the vibration change when it is time to switch to another quadrant.
"
"
I really like this toothbrush! It's pretty basic, as far as electric toothbrushes go, but it's definitely functional! It's got a two minute timer that ends with short burst vibrations. It's super easy to use and it comes with an extra brush head! The only flaw is that I can't tell how full the battery is, or if it is charging when on the charger because there are no indicators of those things.
"
"
Using this for over a year now, works great! My only complaint is that the base gets a little dirty because of how it is shaped, no biggie, just have to wash it every now and then. Bought some after-market replacements heads which work great.
"
"
I bought this toothbrush for my son so that whenever he visits he doesn't have to travel with his charger.  I should add that this toothbrush is an upgrade to the Oral B toothbrush he already has and he's indicated that he might swap them around - i.e. take this newer, better version of the Oral-B toothbrush to his home and bring his older, less efficient one to my home for use during his brief visits.  THAT must mean that he is very pleased with the product and thus I gave it 5 stars.
"
"
Fantastic tooth brush. It works nearly a week long (of brushing 2-3 times/ day) before the next charge is needed.I’ve gotten this tooth brush for many of my loved ones as well because I’m such a fan. They are all very pleased with it !
"
"
Product never worked, dead right out of the box.I opened the package, it said to plug it in for 16h, after 2 days still wouldn't work.  I tried a different outlet, same issue.  I even tried a different charger (my wife has the same unit, she recommended it to me), nothing.  By then I had thrown out the packaging. Not worth the hassle to return it.Garbage.  Buy something else.
"
"
Last almost 1 year. Wont turn/move any more. Thought should last longer than that.
"
"
These work Great No Idea why you want to buy a more expensive one.  My Dentist when cleaning my teeth is like you have hardly any plaque near you gums.  They ask you must be using a powered brush. and yea it does the job.
"
"
Definitely worth the cost. Keeps its charge really well. The timer functions is super helpful. It is a very “rough” tooth brush there is a lot of power to it, if you have a smaller mouth I recommend getting the smaller round head opposed to the dual head. The heads are interchangeable which is great.
"
"
Actually it is a not too bad product considering the price I bought. The biggest downside is that the timer has some problems and cannot automatically shut down by 2 mins, so I always have to turn off by myself. Anyway, the cleaning effect to my teeth is much better than the manual brush, so I still recommend this product.
"
"
GrossGave it 2 weeks but gooy germy  grossness builds up in the little holes and bottom no matter how much you try to dry itIt's HUGE and very uncomfortableDisappointed
"
"
Stopped working after a week. Won't charge. Bad quality. Waste of money.And it's such a genius design that charging only works when it is turned off, while at same time there is no way to tell whether it's turned on when the battery is used up. In other words, you don't know if it is charging at all.
"
"
Surprisingly good for the price! I've had more expensive electric toothbrushes in the past that didn't do the work that this little guy does! If you're looking for an inexpensive model, be it for a child, teen or travel, this is a good bet.

Bought it for my husband; great quality and has enough, but not excessive, vibration; extra brush.  (Generic Oral B brush replacements that I purchased,  work well with it).
"
"
It's good but there's no light that lights up when you put it on the charger so if it were to break you would only know when picking it up after thinking it's charged
"
"
I have used similar Oral-B products before and have always been happy so far. I have no complaints about this product as far as teeth cleaning goes. The only reason for the 4 rating is because this model lacks a charge status light.
"
"
This is a really good entry level toothbrush. Nothing fancy, it works well and gets the job done. I'm really satisfied with the product and recommend this product to everyone. *Update, after a few months of usage, I am stil lreally satisfied with thsi toothbrush.
"
"
Great! I've been using this exact model for the last 3 years but ever since I moved to Canada from Europe I switched to regular toothbrush.As I re-started using this toothbrush I can already see the difference. Totally recommended!
"
"
Best electric toothbrush I ever used.  My mouth has never felt cleaner.  I absolutely love this one, much better than Phillips in my opinion, and my dentist says she had less scaling and cleaning at my last visit.
"
"
Did a nice job, hold its charge very long, but when you rince the hairs under water, make sure not to let the water drip inside, otherwise it will die.
"
"
Beware. My unit stopped working this past week. It would no longer charge. 5 months almost exactly to the day I purchased it.
"
"
I already have been using the Braun toothbrush for many years but the dual clean is new for me. When I'm finished cleaning my teeth, I feel like I've just had them cleaned at the dentist.
"
"
received as promisedHad to ship to an alternate location which is poorcould have shipped to my PO Box but they would not try. was not too large for the PostProduct is super has NMH battery superior to NiCa battery has timer
"
"
First one wasnt starting ans the one I got for replacement cannot hold his charge after 5 months. Waste of money!
"
"
I will never need another toothbrush again found a good deal for the replacement headsc I will never need another toothbrush again found a good deal for the replacement heads great product
"
"
after two months use, battery wont hold a charge.the last one lasted over a yearthere will not be a third one.
"
"
My first brush only lasted a week before it simply wouldn't turn on again; don't know if it or the charger was defective. Thankfully the customer service was great, and a new brush was on it's way to me very quickly. The new brush has been going strong and I think it does a very good job cleaning my teeth.
"
"
I like the brush but the Brissels that came with it were way to hard. Had to order soft heads for it
"
"
The battery in my old one is getting weak and it need to be recharged every 2 days, mind you I had it for a little bit more than 4 yrs.  I just bought another one recently which is on sale for $20 to replace my old one.
"
"
its cheap, works well as a toothbrush and is easy to charge. It is REALLY loud though. Its a good cheap electric toothbrush and the replacement brush heads are not as expensive compared to Sonicare-if you dont mind the noise.
"
"
I have 6 of these, one for each member of the family. I've had to replace 2 already because they stopped charging.
"
"
Only have been using it for a week or so have charged it once already. Works great much stronger than I thought it would be. Leaves teeth feeling very clean. Seems very well made very happy with purchase great price.
"
"
I saved about $15 buying this unit on Amazon versus locally. The only you have to watch is make sure you keep the bottom of the unit dry and clean after brushing as well as the base, so it charges properly. Otherwise it works awesome.
"
"
for someone with a small mouth like me, the head that comes with it is a little too big. Unable to reach my wisdom tooth properly. But other wise, cleans well.
"
"
Nice brush. Has a great cleaning action. Lots of value for money. I was able to put on a generic refill brush too. Only minor gripe is that it doesn't have a charging light.
"
"
Exactly as described. I'm very happy with it! Works really great. Worth every penny and it's so much better than a simple regular brush..In my opinion I feel the difference now.
"
"
je l'ai utilise depuis des mois. aucun problème
"
"
Like the 2  minute  timer  indicator. Battery is strong but discharges sooner than an older model. Cleans teeth well.
"
"
Ce qui me plait, cest que mes gencives ne sirritent pas et ne saignent pas depuis que jutilise ce produit. Cest tres facile a utiliser et la brosse nettoie tres efficacement.
"
"
I was very disappointed with the toothbrush that i got for my boyfriend and it stopped working after around one month. we tried everything and it did not work, stopped charging as well. I paid full price when i got it and it was such a waste!
"
"
Excellent tooth brush.Far superior than regular 2xAA battery versions.You can brush your teeth at least 7 times before having to recharge.
"
"
was really surprised for the price this is a great toothbrush couldnt ask for much more. my teeth havnt felt so clean in a while.really handy charger just drop it on the stand when your done and its always charged and ready. would recomend.
"
"
The toothbrush arrived on the day it was supposed to. The packaging was fine. The battery seems to hold a charge for quite awhile (I can’t keep it plugged in all the time). My teeth feel very clean after brushing.
"
"
Toothbrush is not working even after several hours of charging.
"
"
I was honestly expecting to pay upwards of $100 for an electric toothbrush when I stumbled across this little guy. Works amazingly and my teeth feel so smooth and clean each time. I already purchased 3 for my family. First time electric toothbrush buyer so take it with salt. Would recommend.
"
"
Great Price, and saves time over the ""traditional"" brush... and seems to do a better job...... (ask your hygienist for details). ""Free"" regular tooth brushes from the dentist are fine for travel, but these appliances, which go weeks between charges are safe, and pay dividends.
"
"
Great value for a quality toothbrush.  I switched the larger head out for a smaller brush as it is for my young daughter.  Works beautifully.
"
"
This is my first electrical toothbrush so I'm not sure comparing it to other electrical brushes, but, making the change from a normal one to this was life changing, can't stress enough how much different it feels (In a good way).
"
"
These are great. They really clean your teeth a lot better. I bought one for everyone in the family. The grand kids like it and have less complaining. Even Grandpa like using it. It is a lot faster and they do get a better cleaning. What more can you ask for... no cavities on the next dentist appointment?  :)
"
"
I received the product with some charge, but when I charged the brush it doesn't charge or work. I have left the brush on charging holder for two days and it still doesn't work. Very disappointed!
"
"
Très bonne brosse. Achetée pour remplacer une brosse dont la batterie est fini.
"
"
This electric toothbrush works great.  Lots of power.  I particularly like how long I can use it between charges.  For me it lasts for weeks before having to re-charge.
"
"
Cleans teeth like dentist feel, not to strong and battery last very long time. Came with 2 extra heads, was a nice surprise since there price for replacements.
"
"
Put off buying one for years. Big mistake! Great value and convenient.
"
"
I like it but the timer function seems ton it work. I’m happy it came with extra brush head.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I love it! It lasts for a couple days before needing to be charged and cleans well.
"
"
It's an amazing product, though if I go back I'd buy the 30 second timer instead of 2 minutes. It helps a lot in terms of equally brushing.
"
"
Head spins while the lower bristles move up and down. Base is sleek and doesn’t take up much room. Very happy with the product, especially for the low cost.
"
"
Pros:- easy and fun to use- easy to charge- teeth tingle after brushingCons:Can't think of anything significant but- would be nice with a carry case or something that covers the brush head while packing in a suitcase
"
"
There's a big gap on the body, I'm a bit concerned if this would affect the overall waterproof ability. Otherwise, pretty decent for the price, it's much more affective, but it takes some time to get used to.
"
"
Works very well and after several months of use, it is still working with the original brush head. One charge of the battery easily lasted for 9 days of vacation, although it did slow down a bit.
"
"
For the price, it's quite good at cleaning your teeth. Been using it over 6 months and still works great. Need to change the head, but that's just normal wear and tear.
"
"
Fait un très bon travail mais le modem diffère de l'image.
"
"
Très bonne qualité de brosse à dent.  Très longue durée de vie de la batterie avant de la recharger.
"
"
Bien reçuFonctionne parfaitementSatisfait à 100 pour-cent
"
"
Great product - I even bought the no name replacements and they were much cheaper
"
"
I bought it for my dad and he loves it. He has no complaints, only appreciation for this electric toothbrush. It does a great job and it was worth the money.
"
"
The toothbrush works but it is too harsh in my opinion and the design could improve to be less harsh on teeth.
"
"
Huge improvement from our old Crest Spinbrush electronic brushes. We could feel a huge difference after the first use.
"
"
I find the battery lasts 3-4 days, so it doesn't need to sit on your counter.  Does a thorough cleaning quickly.  Love it
"
"
I have been using this model for a few years. The motor or battery seemed to get a little bit tired (it still lasted well over 5 years) and I had replacement heads so I figured that I should probably buy a new one. At 25$, it was a huge deal. To my amazement, it seems that the model was greatly improved. I just inaugurated it and it was as if a minty tornado of hygiene was decimating an entire population of bacteria under my divine command. Highly recommended.
"
"
Indispensable, je ne peux plus revenir à la brosse à dent manuelle
"
"
Maybe it's a placebo effect or I've just started to clean my teeth better or both! But this toothbrush is seriously making me feel like my teeth are cleaner already. Best investment to date.
"
"
Works great charged it for 12hours and ive been using for almost 2 weeks now and haven't charges it since
"
"
I have always used a manual brush, when I finally decided to make the switch to electric I did not want to deal with replacing the batteries all the time. This toothbrush does a good job of cleaning your teeth, and the rechargeable battery is really handy.
"
"
Works well but hard to find a good deal on brush heads, most are for higher models.
"
"
Great toothbrush and great price! Works well and easy to use. Charges for 16 hours, but the charge holds for at least a week or so. I am very pleased with it. I ordered 3 of them (enough for my family). Thank you!
"
"
Great product. This is the second time buying this. The first one lasted about 2 years...good value for the price and replacement heads are great too
"
"
après 5 ans d'utilisation fonctionne toujours aussi bien!
"
"
Stopped working after one use. Should have paid attention to the reviews stating the same issue. If you're lucky it should work fine. It's a gamble though.Can't recommend.
"
"
Have it for 3 years, still working very well.
"
"
Je n’ai rien d’autre a dire que ca fait très bien le travail.
"
"
First time buying an electric toothbrush and this one is great! Stays charged for more than 10 brushes and comes with one replacement head that I didn't even know about! I can't go back to normal toothbrushes after this.
"
"
My first electric so nothing to compare it to but it does a fine job.
"
"
Itvis an inexpensive functioning product.
"
"
Great.. I just to have 3 differents head for each member of the family but the base is the same.works great
"
"
I find that this toothbrush does an excellent job of cleaning and polishing my teeth. It kind of "" stalls"" momentarily when you reach the end of two minutes. So you know how long you should be brushing. I wish I'd had this toothbrush years ago.
"
"
Great clean with minimal effort. Too bad it stopper working after a full charge and first use
"
"
This device is comfortable to hold and easy to control when brushing.
"
"
perfect toothbrush, everything you want from a basic electric brush, and you can't beat the price. It holds the charge from 5-7 days and comes with a few replaceable heads
"
"
Love this toothbrush. Never had an electric on before..Works very well. Could probably use it to debark trees if I had to too :)
"
"
Never used an electric toothbrush before.  The dental assistant recommended this brand. You can feel the difference.
"
"
Brosse à dents recommandée par mon dentiste. Elle est parfaite et à un très bon prix.
"
"
La livraison a été très rapide étant donner la période des fêtes, la brosse nettoie bien, bonne emballage.Merci
"
"
After 2 weeks of use the battery already dying.The headbrush is too big to clean far side teeth.
"
"
Donne l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste après l'avoir utilisé tellement elle nettoie bien!
"
"
Very goodHighly recommendedOrdering for the whole family
"
"
My first E-brush and it great, happy to have this to help me take care of my teeth.
"
"
Thought it was a great basic electric toothbrush. Unfortunately, the low price is in part due to a cheap battery that dies before you can finish brushing after owning for 6 months. If you don't want to purchase twice a year, it might be worthwhile to switch to another product.
"
"
It works as advertised. It certainly is 'energetic' and noisy compared with a unit purchased a few years ago. On balance it delivers good value for the money.
"
"
There are better options available.
"
"
Best bang for your buck. I purchased another one after mine to give as a birthday gift. They travel well without the charger base and the battery holds. No point spending more money on the really expensive ones, these are just as good.
"
"
Well built. A little pricey
"
"
Great toothbrush, does the job, comes with extra brush (6 month use total) Has the timer function which is cool too. Fast shipping
"
"
Fait la job. 🙀 Pas cher.
"
"
Cette brosse à dents est parfaite.
"
"
Cant go wrong for the price
"
"
Great Product... Specially for the price... Cant beat it.... I never liked the idea of an electric toothbrush... but once you try you'll never go back to manual.... Mouth feels cleaner then ever!!!!
"
"
Good toothbrush, battery life is good and does what it should
"
"
delivered prior to promise date.  If you were buying this off the shelf, it would be for a medium mouth, not small.
"
"
Bought for daughter. She didn’t like it.
"
"
Very very good product
"
"
What more can I say. It's an electric toothbrush and does its job. Get ut
"
"
This works great, my teeth feel very clean. The only thing is that it does not hold charge for very long. Maybe 3-4 days using twice daily.
"
"
Got it on sale and sure happy I bought it.  Cleans well and I like that it doesn't turn off once the two minutes are up like my expensive one did.  The head is a little bigger but I like it.
"
"
Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric ToothbrushDecided to switch over to electric toothbrushes, it worked fine for the first two days. I had charged it twice and it stopped working ever since.
"
"
Still don’t know how to use the timer but the battery life is great and gives a good clean.
"
"
plaisant pour les dents nettoie parfaitement.
"
"
Great tooth brush
"
"
Title says it all
"
"
For a truly clean mouth and teeth, it sure does the job.  I love it.
"
"
In the words of Larry David. Pretty good, pretty, pretty, pretty....pretty good.
"
"
Good product, delivered in timeBetter than manual toothbrush.
"
"
Cheap and effective electric toothbrush. The timer is a nice feature.Remember to charge it first when you take it out of the packaging.
"
"
Bought for my my extra needs son.  It has improved his teeth cleaning ability, helping in his ability to be more independant.
"
"
This is a great intro into electric toothbrushes. But after a few years the battery and motor will show their age. Great for a kid or to test out if electric brushes are right for you!
"
"
I had the same model for many years, figure will buy a new one even so old one was still working fine.
"
"
Really good for the price. Efficient, battery last enough, easy to clean. No complaints so far after 3 month
"
"
Value for money indeed but the rpm is quite low I feel, and battery life is not very good. There's hardly any life left after brushing 1time (2mins)
"
"
Wife loves it
"
"
Bought this item in april 2018 and it is still working fine. I really like this brush, though its not super powerful. So if you want powerful "" beast"" its better to buy more expensive models.
"
"
does what its suppose to
"
"
Great brush, charge lasts a long time, however the tips are not very soft and I will have to purchase softer ones to be comfortable.
"
"
Great idea, makes you brush longer and feels like it does make a difference.  Rechargeable and easy to charge/use.  Good Value!
"
"
Je suis très satisfais .
"
"
Good product.
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent, par contre elle vibre pas mal fortViens avec des coupons rabais mais ils sont EXPIRÉS!
"
"
very good
"
"
The dentist keeps complimenting me about my teeth, it can only be due to this toothbrush!
"
"
Brush is amazing but bristles are not good enough to last a month long. Rest is best
"
"
I enjoy the price of this product. I really don't understand how there are models in the 100s, meanwhile this tooth brush as the major essentials that do the job.
"
"
It's a great toothbrush. However, a light indicating the brush is charging or low battery would have been nice...
"
"
One of my best investments. The dual clean makes a difference in comparison with a regular toothbrush. Needs a recharge every 2-3 days.
"
"
A single charge last for several days. Instantly have noticed cleaner teeth.
"
"
Thanks!
"
"
Works great Price was good. Came with an extra head and took not to long to get a full charge.
"
"
Love how it let's you know when it's been 2 minutes! Brush works great and holds a charge for multiple brushes
"
"
Best gift I ever bought myself, then went and bought my daughters one as well..great product, amazing price. Thank you
"
"
Great! Good price too!
"
"
Works well as advertised.
"
"
Not as powerful as I expected.  Kind of on par with the battery operated brushes at the drugstore which are much cheaper.
"
"
Great
"
"
Excellente !! Super achat
"
"
J'adore ma nouvelle brosse à dent qui fait un très bon travail qualité prix.
"
"
Great charging system, just place in holder.
"
"
Great.  Very effective. Only downside is replacement heads can be expensive. And there is no warning when battery about to die / needs charging
"
"
Conforme
"
"
The electrical brush is a good improvement from a regular one. It is working as intended and now I am brushing me teeth for 2 min or so rather than the 30 seconds I used to.
"
"
I like the two different brush heads, although it’s a bit loud
"
"
Good deal
"
"
A l air super comme produit
"
"
Excellent produit
"
"
Works super ! I have been using it for 2 weeks now and I have nothing bad to say ! I recommend
"
"
For price how can you go wrong
"
"
Bought 3 and all functioned perfectly
"
"
Brushes your teeth.  I find it does a way better job then my old manual brushes did.  Would buy again
"
"
Does the job
"
"
price was good, and purchased to augment existing unit
"
"
I've had this for almost 2 years and have never had a problem! Works great!
"
"
the bristles should be little bit soft and flexible too harsh on the gums the speed should be little bit less
"
"
Battery doesn’t work for long. I regret purchasing.
"
"
Very efficient teeth cleening, you don't need to put it on the charge every day. I would say every 5 days when you use it twice a day.
"
"
I never used an electric toothbrush before and was pleasantly surprised when I tried this one. Does a good job and makes brushing the teeth kind of fun!
"
"
full charge lasts around 5 times of brushing. Otherwise function as described
"
"
Too bad it does not have a charger signal...so i never know when it is actually charging
"
"
Super appareil. Son seul défaut est de laisser sa base de recharge sale : l'eau s'accumule dessus avec les bactéries associées.
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush.
"
"
Luke it
"
"
I love it
"
"
Works great .
"
"
Best electric toothbrush I ever brought.
"
"
Great unit - feels like I just left the dentist after every brushing.
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dents. Bon prix. Livraison rapide!
"
"
Great product and price. Has a lot of power and leaves you with that clean teeth feel.Highly recommended.
"
"
Works great , and I hope it lasts as long as the Oral-B products I have used
"
"
Great electric toothbrush for the price. Everybody should have one. My teeth are much cleaner.Some people recommand/prefer the round tip than the dual one, but I don't see/have any problem using the dual one until now.
"
"
It does a very good job and small enough for my small mouth.
"
"
I bought it when it is on sale, as my first electrical toothbrush. The quality is good and shipping is fast. It is a good choice as an entry-level electrical toothbrush.
"
"
Still using it 2 years later!
"
"
Works great. Definitely  does a better job  than  regular  tooth  brush.
"
"
i’m very satisfied with product
"
"
I got this around christmas for $18. Works very well. Still going strong after over a month of use. Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
Love the Oral-B rechargeable toothbrushes,  my teeth feel so clean!My hygienist recommends using an electric toothbrush, had my last one for nine years, believe it or not.
"
"
Battery lasts 1 day only. Got replacement and same issue. Needs to be charging all the time.
"
"
I use it daily . Its the only brand that i trust. It has a two minute timer and lets you know with a vibration that your two min is up  .. nice
"
"
Great tooth brush
"
"
As headline
"
"
As expected
"
"
I love everything about this!
"
"
Love it works fine
"
"
Great quality for the price!
"
"
Bought to replace old electric toothbrush. lives up to my expectations.
"
"
Très satisfait. IL est préférable d'acheter d'autres brosses car elles perdent beaucoup leurs poils. Sinon A1!
"
"
Battery driven power toothbrushes do not do the job this robust Dual Clean brush can do.  Even my hygienist notices the improvements.  Buy it for superior dental health
"
"
Cleans anything accumulated. food, dust, mud, you name it. Satisfied after a year!
"
"
Good
"
"
The perfect little electric toothbrush, it's all I need.  And shipping was fast!
"
"
Gave me a fresh just out of the dental clinic feeling.  Neat wireless charging station that I didn't expect.
"
"
I have purchased one about a month ago, ended buying a second one because the wife kept stealing it.
"
"
Très bonne mais t'est mieux d'acheter les têtes d'origine
"
"
Works as expected and described
"
"
Ma fille aime beaucoup
"
"
ok. the charger gets slower after every use. needs improvement... a little disapointed.
"
"
Powerful and reliable.
"
"
My son loves it. It's easier to use than a regular tooth brush & cleans better too.
"
"
Satisfied with this purchase works great for the price
"
"
I like it, good product👍
"
"
Does the job it was intended for.
"
"
Works great, love the timer, lasts about 1 year.
"
"
Works great! Good coverage over teeth, reduces the amount of effort I take in brushing my teeth
"
"
works well
"
"
Works great
"
"
Le temps de 2 minutes est long pour les jeunes enfants.
"
"
You can’t go wrong with it
"
"
Great price.  Love it
"
"
perfect for my family's need. why buy expensive stuff when this can already do the things an expensive electric toothbrush can..
"
"
Had one before liked it so I saw this on sale and bought it.
"
"
Very happy with it. My teeth have never been cleaner. I recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap electric brush. Comes with two brush heads.
"
"
As advertised.  Pleased with the item.
"
"
excellent
"
"
bon produit
"
"
Best price and quality. I go through one of these maybe every 3 years, and it's usually after a few accidental drops. Excellent brush.
"
"
Arrived on time. Works perfectly. Good brush.
"
"
Cleans teeth well and holds a good charge.
"
"
3rd one I got, I love them and  the dentist  does also
"
"
One full unit stopped working after less then two months. Now I'm sharing mine with my wife.....not what we had in mind!...
"
"
Not bad. Does the job. May find it for cheaper at walmart.
"
"
New and works perfect
"
"
❤
"
"
Bought one for everyone in the family.
"
"
Minimum footprint, does the job, even shuts off automatically when put back on the recharger. What more can you ask of a toothbrush?!?
"
"
And the two minute timer is appreciated to make sure I brush long enough.  Works less forcefully if left off the charger for a few days (obviously), so as long as you keep it on the charger full-time it's great.
"
"
Très bien pour le prix. Je ne regrette pas mon achat
"
"
Really great gift for your significant other.
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Good
"
"
I like this toothbrush very much, it does an excellent job of brushing,light weight easy to use very good product
"
"
I love it
"
"
vraiment une belle brosse, semble parfaite,
"
"
Very good buy
"
"
Works great, but not quite as nice as the professional series. Still worth the money.
"
"
I  really  love  it!  Makes  your  teeth  feel  so  clean  and  whiter.
"
"
Seems to work well, has more power than the previous model I had. The spare heads from my previous one also work on it fortunately.
"
"
Each time I use this toothbrush I end up with a bristle in my mouth. They come off very easily. I do not recommend.
"
"
très bon rapport qualité/prix, très satisfait
"
"
I got this on sale for like $8 and it's amazing.  Such a good brush for that price.  I highly recommend the brush if you can get it at or near the same price I did!
"
"
Everything that I have bought from Amazon has been great. the only thing that gave me problems was the Belt for my phone and things I found it was to small for my stuff..I gave it to my grand daughter and she uses it for small shoppkins toys,so all is good.Thank you.
"
"
So good I bought two.
"
"
this is a piece of junk  don t waste your money
"
"
It works better than my original brush
"
"
Very good quality!
"
"
Good product. Works well
"
"
I use this product to brush my teeth obviously.  Works well
"
"
Works great, my mouth seems and feels much cleaner compared to manual brushing!
"
"
I have been using this for many months now. Love it still. The brush heads are a bit expensive but I love the toothbrush.. Works great.
"
"
Works fine , been using it for over a month .You can leave it plugged at all times, won't damage & battery works a fairly long time .Great buy
"
"
Really good and soft brush
"
"
Really cleans teeth well. Every night I use it and you can actually see the difference.
"
"
Absolutely perfect! Got zero issues with it
"
"
Great value. Charge lasts days. Would buy again. (Have recommendedto friends.)
"
"
I like it very much it gets areas of my teeth that the manual toothbrush does not get
"
"
Great brush for the price been using it for a month now and is perfect
"
"
This product is definitely worth it.
"
"
This is the second one I've owned, the last one lasted years. It just slowly started to lose it's stength in the last 2 years. The new one has tons of power and considering the price, it's a great value. Definitely recommend!
"
"
Great product
"
"
It's okay. The battery don't last too long, have to charge it regularly.
"
"
Arrived quickly and is exactly as promised.
"
"
Really great quality! You can see very quick results.
"
"
Still working after more than a year... Underwater. Being recharged again and again. Does its job very well everyday! Timer is helpful too
"
"
merci amazon pour cette brosse a dent je l adore ces super ,
"
"
Works well, but is noisy.

On the first time it worked just fine but after that it kept dying after 30 sec of use
"
"
👍
"
"
Seriously works great, never bought a more expensive electric toothbrush so I can't compare, but with these I might never have to. Last one I bought lasted around 5 years before the battery started being weaker and I decided to replace it.
"
"
Works well
"
"
Love it

"
"
Love it
"
"
Cleans great.
"

This Oral-B rechargeable works as well as the Philips Sonicare at a 3rd of the price. Great deal fast shipping with Prime.
"

I am very satisfied of my New Electric toothbrush. It is right on Whats  i expected to be!  👍
"
"
Pretty reliable electric toothbrush.
"
"
good value, does the job.
"
"
I'm a very hard person to please and this product has met my standards.The reviews are legit, dont think and just buy.
"
"
great product works fine
"
"
Great rechargeable toothbrush, but the head is way too big to properly brush. Would recommend the small circular one.
"
"
Great deal
"
"
Best brush ever
"
"
Product works good very pleased
"
"
Perfect use, small portable charger, came really quickly (much to my surprise) and I enjoy the speed that it works at for brushing.
"

I love it.  My teeth have never felt so clean!
"
"
Not intended for gentle teeth and sensitive gums.First few times I had an impression that I am going to get a concussion lol
"
"
Excellent product. It cleans the teeth ten times more than cleaning with regular toothbrush.
"
"
It's not the same as the pics
"
"
This is a great product, and you can always depend on AMAZON.
"
"
very good
"
"
My daughter loves it
"

"
"
It's is great product. Would recommend it to everyone
"
"
An old electric toothbrush's battery died.  It was back to manual brushing till I came across this.  Oral-B has a great product here!
"
"
I did love this toothbrush, but after only 7 months it doesn't charge anymore. Contemplating a different brand for the next time. :(
"
"
Thourough cleaning-you will not find a better electric toothbrush than this
"
"
Does not work anymore...up to you to decide if one year is enough of a life span for this.
"
"
Works great no issues here.
"
"
Good toothbrush.  Easy to clean and the charge lasts.
"
"
Works as well as more expensive brushes
"
"
Works well, very happy.
"
"
Love it, especially the interchangeable head.
"
"

La brosse à dent a fonctionné 6 mois seulement. Je vais tenter d'obtenir un remboursement de la part d'Amazon.
"
"
I always use oral B and it works well. Don’t really find anything unsatisfying
"
"
I recommende that toothbrush to everyone.Easy to use, stay rechargeable long term, fast, good clean etc etc Very satisfy
"
"
I will update if anything changes but perfect so far.

Holds a good charge for days and makes brushing your teeth super easy
"

Great tooth brush,  easy to use.

Good. Except it runs off a regular battery and is not rechargeable.
"
"
Never know when charging is done!
"
"
Works great
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I am loving it so far. My brushing was never easier and what was once a painful ordeal is now a refreshing experience.It was particularly satisfying that I was able to get it for under $20. And, it comes with a spare brushhead.
"
"
I am happy with the Braun toothbrush as I previously had one and was very satisfied with it..David B.
"
"
Easy to use. I feel it does a good job, much better than the one it replaced. I have no problem recommending it as a good buy.
"
"
great product
"
"

Works great!The toothbruch is a bit bulky and awkward at first, but you get used to the feel.
"

it's perfect.
"

used for years and still using it without any issue. very solid products!
"

Great product. Timely delivery.

Good unit, just have to use the smaller head brush.

Great electric toothbrush for the money
"
"
THANKS
"
"
Very very good product. Cleans your teeth really well
"

"
"
What a positive difference a quality toothbrush makes!
"
"
good quality, shopping on time
"
"
Came quick great product
"
"
Good product. Cheaper than buying local
"
"
Disappointed.  Works slowly, not as fast as the one it was replacing.  Single speed instead of dual speed.
"
"
Teeth feel clean , like you went to the dentist.
"
"
I find the head large & took awhile to get use to.
"
"
Très satisfaite. Merci
"

So good! Honestly can never go back to a regular toothbrush... best 18 dollars i’ve ever spent

Needs to be charged every 2-3 uses, battery is really bad !!!

Ordered additional ones for family members and they certainly love it!

So far I am completely satisfied with this toothbrush.  It is really too soon to tell. I would recommend this.

I got this electrical toothbrush on sale, having always used manual brushes in the past. I didn't think there would be much difference, but WOW was I wrong! This thing honestly leaves your mouth feeling like you just left the dentist office for a routine clean! Really fresh, able to reach all my teeth with ease, powerful. The charge lasts a pretty long time (I brush 2-3 times a day & have it 'plugged in' almost all the time after using, so it never really 'runs out'). It came with some replacement heads for changing in 3 months time, which is a nice bonus.The only downside is the brush heads don't come with any type of 'cover' or 'cap' for storage/after-use. It would be great if they added something like that in the pack, but you can find some covers/caps on Amazon for cheap.Overall 5/5 - I recommend this toothbrush to all my friends & family (many have actually bought it too)
"
"
I absolutely love this tooth brush.  It is hard to imagine going back to a manual brush.  The brushes that come with this brush *are too large for me.* Not so large that they do not fit in my mouth but they trigger a gag reflex.  Anticipating this I paired the Vitality with Oral-b ""sensitive brush heads.""  The small size of the sensitive brushes reduces my gag reflex.  The brush is very effective and has provided countless ""after the dentist"" cleanings.  The battery lasts for about 5-7 days.  This depends on whether you brush for 2 minutes, as recommended, or longer.  Overall I would recommend this brush to anyone interested in better oral health.  The downside is the large (for me), included brush head.
"
"
Exceeded my expectations! I've used the regular Oral B for years. I switched to the Oral B Vitality  and I am amazed how much cleaner my teethe and mouth feel! My only misgiving is that the cheaper replacement heads that are NOT genuine ORAL B Vitality, will fall short of my expectations. From past experience, the regular Oral B heads exceeded the performance and durability of the less expensive substitutes! I personally feel that AMAZON should withdraw selling cheaper inexpensive substitutes! They invariably work out to be more expensive in the long run!
"
"
This rechargeable electric toothbrush has a single on/off switch and sits on a flat surface on the charger. The surface is easier to clean than the older model. It has excellent vibration and cleans teeth effectively. Price is cheaper than what I bought my first Oral-B Electric Toothbrush.
"
"
This toothbrush performs well, holds charge for longer than previous models, and is very effective. I liked that it came with an extra brush head. Excellect value.
"
"
Just can't beat the value of this product on sale at $21.99. This is my first electric toothbrush and I would have converted long ago had I known just how good they have become. Good quality construction with a soft rubber gripper on base. Two minute timer made me realize I was not brushing long enough with my old toothbrush. I'm very impressed with length of time between charges, 4-5 days. It's light and has a small charger stand so it's good for the traveller. You wouldn't even need the charger for short trips. I now enjoy brushing my teeth as it gets to hard to reach places with ease. I would rank this as one of my best valued items I've purchased from Amazon.
"
"
My old one quit working some time ago and I was pleased to find this one.  My vanity is small and this fits perfectly next to the regular toothbrush holder.
"
"
Recharges and brushes well. My only complaint, as some others have mentioned, is the lack of a recharging light: you can't tell if it's actually recharging or not, so you just have to assume it is. Still, a minor issue.
"
"
Excellent electric toothbrush, I like the built-in 2 minute timer.The heads seems to be a little expensive but I've had it for a month now and the unit itself seems pretty solid.The only issue I had was when it ran out of battery life (after using it for a week without changing it). It dies quickly and without warning. Like its working 100% and then mid brush boom 0%. Changed it up again and it was back to 100%. So just something to be mindful of.
"
"
Parfait. Excellent rapport qualité-prix. Meilleur prix qu'en pharmacie. Offrez-vous ce cadeau. Avoir su, jaurai jeté ma brosse à dent manuel bien avant ! Seul bémol, la charge; il faut là charger environ 16 heures pour 30 Minutes d'utilisation , et rien n'indique quand elle doit être rechargée.

Fisrt time shoppong in amazon.ca and got so disappointed. It's only half a month and this electric toothbrush stopped working! No matter how I tried, the engine cannot start again.
"
"
Good toothbrush for the price. Initially I thought it wouldn't hold a charge, but turned out to be an issue with my bathroom outlet. My biggest complaint is that it has a serious design flaw where your saliva and plaque can leak into the handle. I clean it frequently but I wish I didn't have to.
"
"
I'd been using a more expensive Oral-B toothbrush that has lasted since around 2009-2010; for instance, it had the ability to display when it was charging and to time brushing of the teeth into 30 second intervals. When that brush died after what I'd consider a ton of use, I decided to go with a cheaper replacement that didn't have those extras, but which what I thought was the same model as one that my wife has used regularly for years without issue. The difference is that the charger that came with mine has already failed within six months of use. It's clearly a different design and one that apparently has more durability than the one I got. I haven't looked into whether they have a replacement charger available, but I'm pretty unhappy that I have to even bother looking this soon.
"
"
a good little toothbrush, but i have to change batteries every 2 months. it could also have a bit more power in the brush movement. doesn't take up a lot of room on the bathroom sink. a bit tricky to change the batteries, but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.
"
"
I bought two products. Those were defective. I sent them back to you. I want my deliveries soundly. Is it possible? Do you have a solid product that works?I sent it back to you on two defective products.Are you still sending back the new ones?When do you think to send it back?This is your 6th message.
"
"
i charge it long time , but i can not use during 3 minute, it is a big issue for the power charging
"
"
My dentist recently suggest I use an electric toothbrush, since they're more accurate and reliable than manual brushing (hands down).This meets my needs and then some. It has a built in timer that changes how the brush rotates for a few seconds; the purpose is to inform you that you've been brushing for 2 minutes and should stop now. The brush stays clean, since I rinse the head while it's still turned on for a second.At some point you will have to buy replacements, but manual brushes have the same problem. Dental hygiene is hella worth the effort and money, jaw pain /bad cavities are unbearable!

"
Went to France with our new toothbrush and it died on us despite having the right adaptor and voltage regulator.
"
"
Battery life is not great
"
"
Great price.
"
"
The battery of the product stop charging in a month after i purchased from this store. The product itself was actually produced in 2011, which is beyond its original warranty cover rage. ;(
"
"
Vibration is too strong for sensitive teeth.
"
"
it is my first time to try electric brush, so far so good!
"
"
Pros:-There's a timer that indicates when 2 minutes are over-Easy to clean-The color of the brush head fades which makes it easy to determine when to change it-My teeth feel really clean after every use-Provided with an extra brush head in the packageCons:-Not operated by battery. If I plan to travel outside of Canada, the country I will go to might not use the same charging outlet. So, I will have to purchase a special charging outlet.-Does not have a storage containerTo be frank, if I ever have to buy a toothbrush to a friend or loved one, I would definitely choose this one. Although it has ONLY two disadvantages, it's still effective in delivering a healthy and clean smile!!
"
"
I would never buy this Oral B electric toothbrush again, as it failed after 3 months and that is disgusting.It still makes a tiny sound, but forget abt actually doing a brushing job.OralB should be ashamed to make such a defective product!
"
"
I have never really used any other more expensive power brushes so I can't really compare it to those. But compared to a manual brush this is a game changer. Your teeth will feel way cleaner. The battery is very strong too, the first Vitality I had lasted 7 years before the battery stopped holding a charge.
"
"
The battery on this lasts forever.  It states to drain the battery every 6 months.  It took a full week of using it twice a day.  Charges very quickly and works extremely well.
"
"
I've had this for several months now, and it works great. However I haven't been to the dentist yet so we'll see what he says when I get a check up. I find this much more convenient than a manual toothbrush. I only need to charge it once a week. I'll update after I have talked to my dentist.
"
"
LOVE it!  funny story.. I thought my old one was dying but ends up outlet breaker had popped.. but I'm very glad i got this one with timer.. who knew 2 minutes was so long.. haha.
"
"
Works well, and is easy to use. It would be nice if it included speech synthesis so that people who have a vision impairment could use it more easily and independently.
"
"
My teeth have never felt so clean!  For the value it is a great product, especially coming with a replacement head at the start.  It cleans deeply but isn't too hard on the gums.  I don't know why it took me so long to get one.  I won't be going back to the manual toothbrush.
"
"
Works well. I like the 2 min timer. Low cost, works well, teeth feels clean and feels like a proper brushing.
"
"
This is the best!
"
"
Great product and fast prime shipping. Love it
"
"
Pretty good. But before power off, there is no indication and completely doesn't work. I have another type from Oral-B, before power off, the light is flash and can still use for another 1-2 minutes, so at least you can finish the brush for this time and then charge the power for next time.
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Teeth feel really clean when done brushing them.  Nice price.  Satisfied with purchase.
"
"
Love it! Exactly what I was looking for and a great price point.
"
"
lower brush head broken, but as tooth brush this is a fantastic product. will order some more brush heads.
"
"
just what we wanted, no bells and whistles just an excellent product at a very good price
"
"
Perfect, very powerful and great for clean teeth. Cheap for an electronic toothbrush
"
"
Works great.  exactly as described.  would buy it again.
"
"
Works well,Very good quality!
"
"
Very great product
"
"
Excellent toothbrush that may save your gums from rotting into oblivion. When I first switched from manual to electric, it felt like a sanding belt inside your mouth - tearing off that gunk that sits there after a full hearted meal. I personally use the sensitive brush heads since they are smaller and cause less gag.The battery on this model typically lasts around two weeks without recharging, but the effectiveness of the whirl will reduce with each brush because it's spinning slower as the battery drains.Would recommend this for anyone who wants to keep their teeth.
"
"
Good little brush.
"
"
Bought for my wife.  She raves about it and reminds me often
"
"
Very satisfied.
"
"
Very good product
"
"
Very good, cleaning teeth becomes so easy at home!
"
"
Item as described.  Can't go wrong with Oral B!
"
"
It is worth buying,I appreciated it
"
"
Good!
"
"
Pretty good and as same as the description. Yet, the light indicator for charging is not obvious.
"
"
Excellent product at a very good price.
"
"
Useful, and the price is really acceptable
"
"
Super!
"
"
Good product
"
"
Great value. Excellent service.
"
"
Love it! But maybe too much larger than normal ones
"
"
Perfect. A reasonable price. I love it!
"
"
I bought this for my daughter.I bought myself a high end Oral B for almost $150. This comes with the same charger, and extra brush head also. I could have saved a lot of money just buying one of these for me. This works great. My daughter has adjusted to the 2 minute brush time - this does a good job of warning you when it's time. Im giving this 5 stars because compared to the expensive kits, this works just as well, without the fancy bells and whistles.
"
"
I'm pleasantly surprised at how well this gadget works.  I bought it because my dentist told me I was brushing my teeth with too much force, causing my gums to thin.  The Oral-B Vitality saves me from having to use any pressure at all, since it's the one doing all the work.  I just have to move it across my teeth.  The built-in two-minute alert is a nice feature, though I'm guessing I've been under-brushing for much of my adult life because the two minutes sometimes feel subjectively longer than from before I had the device.The best thing I can say about the Oral-B Vitality is that, after I've finished using it, it's like my teeth and gums have just had a massage session.  My mouth feels clean, fresh, and pampered!P.S. I'm subtracting one star from my review because the packaging was designed by sadists.  Seriously, there are so many layers of plastic that have to be cut with scissors (there are no snap-apart sections), I almost cut myself several times on sharp plastic edges just removing the package contents.  I thought this kind of wasteful, frustrating, and dangerous packaging was a thing of the past!

After trying a few brushes, I haven't left this one.Most brushes have a single action - spinning, or vibrating up and down.  This is one of the few brushes that has both and boy does it make a difference.Comes with a rechargeable battery, and a recharging base. Heads are replaceable.  Simple one button operation, even has a timer ""buzz"" to let you know when you have  brushed long enough.My favourite part, I can get 20 heads for $15.99, bringing down the cost of ownership on these to next to nothing, and helping ensure low dentist bills at the same time.MaxAike1 Generic Oral-B Braun Vitality EB417 EB/SB-417 Dual Clean Toothbrush Heads (20 PCS)
"
"
One of the better sub $35 brushes out there.Has a very nice non slip grip,soft on and off switch,not too big.The charging base could be a bit larger though it tends to tip easily if touched but cord is very long.The head bristles itself has dual action cleaning which is great,for first time users it may feel strange but after a few uses you get use to it.Cleaning itself it is very good since it can get into the nooks and tight spaces without fear of brushing too hard and cause bleeding.Settings is basic 2 minute timer which is the normal time needed for a good brushing.There are lots of more expensive brushes out there that has lots of settings, sleeker looking with anti bacteria UV lighting but if you want a basic dependable brush with affordable replacement brushes this is a great  product.
"
"
I had bought the older model of this same toothbrush 4-5 years ago but the battery died recently. Since it was a very good toothbrush and the lifespan/price ratio was really good too i bought this new model. But I was baffled by the quality and the power of this one. At full charge the power of this one feels like when the battery on the older was about to be out of charge. And the feel of it seems of the build seem much more sketchy/cheap.
"
"
This was my first electric toothbrush, and I'm happy with it. It's a simple brush, easy to clean and the timer is really helpful for making me brush for the full 2 minutes every time. It's easy to clean since the brush itself is waterproof, so I wash it with soap and water and wipe down the brush head as well. I charge it overnight about once a week for twice daily use. You definitely feel the difference when the battery starts to die down a bit, so charging it twice per week or leaving it on the charger would be the best option.
"
"
I bought this for my spouse.  The toothbrush is great looking and well made.  My disappointment is that, unlike the one I had bought long ago for myself, two key features are missing.  There is no indicator to tell you that the battery is close to exhausted and the unit needs charging.  And there is no indicator light to tell you the battery is fully charged,
"
"
I bought this electric brush for my kid to help with the teeth brushing routine, as the battery operated ones had lost their luster.I was reluctant at first to buy, I was concerned of how it would compare to the one I purchased for around $100.The differences I noted are:No timer that vibrates to tell you you've brushed long enough,& it does not have the red light to tell you to release pressure.Other than that, its very similar.Like on mine, I changed the head to a smaller one.(its compatible with other Oral B rotating heads.)I am very satisfied with the purchase. My kid is happy to have an electric tooth brush, and she loves to brush her teeth and I don't have to keep pushing for action!
"
"
Cheap and effective electric toothbrush. Nothing fancy, just basic and that's what I like.The dual brush head might be feel a little awkward and a little too big, but I got used to it after a week's use.Two minute timer works as expected.One thing I found odd is even after I thoroughly rise the tooth brush and dry it after use, I still notice soap residue drying up on the base after a few days. Needs to be constantly cleaned.
"
"
It’s a great powerful toothbrush. The heads that come with it (2 of them) are comparable to a soft medium. I wish the battery lasted longer because I don’t leave it sitting out. I get around 3 days, brushing twice for 2 minutes before it dies without much notice. The price is great though, and I recommend it for a cheaper alternative to the pricier models.
"
"
I've been purchasing oral b rechargeable electric brushes as gifts for family and friends.  At first they are insulted or think it's a joke, but not soon after they praise them as their best gift. It's cheap, effective and impresses  my dentist during annual visits. I've had mine for years and I bought this second one for my winter home.
"
"
Je ne regrette pas mon achat !! Brosse à dents très efficace grâce à sa double tête rotative. Je suis allée faire un détartrage il y a un peu plus de deux mois et j’ai l’impression que c’était hier, la plaque dentaire n’adhère pas tellement la brosse à dents est efficace par rapport à la brosse à dents classique ! Je suis ravie d’avoir opté pour cette brosse à dent électrique
"
"
I am very pleased with this battery powered toothbrush. I initally bought a sonic style but found that the high frequency vibration caused a 'tickling' sensation in my mouth which I couldn't stand. I then bought this brush and have been very happy with it.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush of my own. I have used a manual battery operated brush and tried my husbands basic electric. This one is by far the best. My husband is upgrading his. Very low noise yet powerful motor. Holds a good solid charge. Relatively lightweight.Update: This is a 2nd purchase and it is the updated model. Works perfectly. Battery life is very good. The first one I bought is still going strong. Won't use any other brand or type
"
"
This toothbrush has a strong motor and a decent battery life per charge, maybe up to a week depending on usage. At the 2 min mark, it does a double pause to let you know, feels like battery was about to die at first. It feels light and durable, and should last reasonably long for the price. I'm happy with this purchase and it's way better than the battery operated brushes.
"
"
Overall a good product. No 30-second warning for each quadrant of your teeth. It didn't stop after two minutes of brushing, but did vibrate at that point so you have the choice to continue brushing or stop. The replacement brushes are quite pricey. There is a $10 coupon if you register, but it won't allow Canadian customers to complete the registration because you cannot input Canadian provinces. This offer is a farce. So one star deduction here and another deduction for the brushes.
"
"
I don't need a super fancy toothbrush, this one checks all the right boxes. Affordable, easy to find replacement heads, battery lasts. I don't need bluetooth on my toothbrush (or even a timer for that matter) and this is perfect.
"
"
Love this brush. Works great. The timer helps alot. I dont bleed like I did with regular brushes from brushing too hard. It kinds does everything for you, you just have to maneuver it. Kind of loud but doesnt bother me.
"
"
Better than even our older Oral-B's.  Love this brand when we wanted to get a set for our Muskoka mobile home did not hesitate and they did not disappoint.  They clean so much better than manual brush.
"
"
A lot more powerful than I originally anticipated. Left my mouth and teeth feeling far better over a manual brush.Rated 4/5 because although it works fabulously, you can see in the pictures that the bottom of the toothbrush where the charging hole is that there's no locking mechanism in place so it feels kinda loose and has play when it's sitting on the charger, giving me the impression that it's not charging but I verified that it does charge.Other than that, it's great and I recommend it to anyone looking for something that will work hard on the teeth.Also great that that they have different heads for different people which although I haven't tried, I'm sure they work just as good.
"
"
How did I live without this toothbrush before?! Great speed and pressure. Timer is appropriate. Comfortable. The dual toothbrush heads are the best, but rather expensive. Singles work fine though. Would buy this again.
"
"
Great product. Works and clean well. Charge in one night and still working after one week of brushing. Easy to replace the head. I tried a couple of them over the year (Phillips,Sonic...) and this one is my favourite to date. Comes with one extra head (total two).
"
"
This is a wonderful toothbrush, and I am very glad I bought it.  The best feature for me is that it alerts you after 2 minutes that you have brushed enough--otherwise I would stand there all day.  Good price, good job--couldn't ask for anything more.May 5 2015.  Well, it lasted almost exactly 1 year.  I liked it so much I bought another one to replace it.  Should it have lasted more than a year?
"
"
Best bang for your buck. Its the cheapest yet most effective toothbrush out there. If you don't need all those gimmicks like a screen or brushing hardness sensors, then this is the one for you. It has that 2 minute timer which is the only feature you really need (depending on your dental circumstances of course).Brush heads I replace ~1x/4 months, and are relatively cheap to replace. For long trips (more than a few days) I would bring the charger with me. I find that after the 2nd day without charging it causes the strength of the motor to get weaker.
"
"
This toothbrush is amazing it is so powerful and cleans great. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth under 2mins even before the time kicks in.I have an older Oral-B that I replaced with this one and it is 100 times better. I highly recommend this brush, it is a dual clean so a bit big if you have a small mouth. My wife does not like it she would prefer a smaller brush but it is great for me.
"
"
The brush is very big and takes getting used to, compared to my old one it has fewer features. The timer only tells you when two minuets are up, not the four notices which let you decide the time equally on the diferent parts of your mouth. It has no flashing red light to warn you to recharge, it has no light to tell you it is charging, it is an oversized stripped down version of the old rechargeable.M
"
"
This toothbrush seems like it should cost more than it did. It cleans my teeth very well, and it feels like a high quality product. The charging base is a smooth plastic with a slightly concave shape, making it very easy to occasionally rinse off any toothpaste residue that runs down the toothbrush. The battery life seems to be pretty good (I've taken it for a weekend trip without the base), but I normally just leave it plugged in
"
"
I had a similar brush before this - the Oral B CrossAction Pro. The brush heads looked almost identical, but this brush is much more gentle on the teeth and gums while still thoroughly cleaning my teeth. It feels smoother as well and cleans up well. The built-in timer is very handy as well as it is very easy to lose track of how long I have been brushing. This is a very good toothbrush and you can't beat the price!
"
"
The batteries aren't serviceable by the consumer. That's intentional.. crappy environmental policy.I changed my review because the seller was great and I didn't understand how reviews should work.To;Dr: everything is the same as you'd get in a store, the planned obsolescence is just goofy for brand loyalty
"
"
I bought them for my kids and they work great.  I already had one myself so I knew to expect a better brushing compared to a manual toothbrush.  Replacement brushes can be expensive.
"
"
Very happy with this product, especially that I bought is when it was on sale. It is the third I buy and the first two have lasted a very long time. It keeps the charge for at least three full power, full duration brushes. I keep it charging all the time.
"
"
I actually bought this for my boyfriend to replace his electric toothbrush that had broken, and I loved it SO MUCH, I went out and bought one for myself too! It's not high tech, so it's not hard to use, and it definitely feels better than using a normal toothbrush. Several weeks in, my teeth are noticeably cleaner and whiter!
"
"
I couldn't believe the difference in cleaning power between this and my older model Oral-B. The brushing action (and the brush style) are superb in comparison. I now look more attractive than ever.
"
"
Bought this as my old Oral B was starting to ""Act Up"" & glad I did. this 1 is More Powerful & came with 2 Dual Heads as advertised. Plus my Extra Dual heads from my Old Oral B fit the New 1 Perfectly, which was a pleasant surprise.
"
"
I have used 3 different Oral-B toothbrushes and they are all great.  I especially like the small round head that is easy to maneuver in my mouth, battery life is long and it is easy to clean.
"
"
I was reluctant to purchase this product but I am presently surprised by how thorough it is and I am recommending this product to anyone looking for a great product.
"
"
Best value electric toothbrush. You can even get cheaper brush heads on amazon as well. My preferred toothbrush for the past 5 years.
"
"
This a great tooth brush. My first one I had for 10 years. It was a rechargable one and it still runs except the moving parts are waring out to the point that they pinch my lips. That's why I have ordered this one also I enjoy the timer on it. It is also quiter than my old one and i think it is faster also. great brush and good ordering service thank you.
"
"
this is an excellent toothbrush! Especially if you get it on the sale price. It is pretty much everything you want in an electric toothbrush. Don't waste your money on one of those spin brushes that take batteries the handy little charger keeps us toothbrush ready at all times.This is a definitely must get you don't need to think twice just purchase.
"
"
First time using electric tooth brush. I was sold. So much better than manual one, Easy to use, cleans my teeth much better and I don,t have to brush hard anymore so my sensitive teeth are gone. Besides it is fun to brush. Lastly if you suffer from aching hand, I will recommend switching to a electric one.
"
"
I have been using this tooth brush for over 4 months now and do not have any issues with it. It works well and I love the clean feel it leaves on my teeth. Overall it is a good product at an excellent price.
"
"
My second toothbrush. I have one and also gifted one to a friend because I was so impressed by the size and easy handling. I have had mine for a year and it is still working as if still new.
"
"
It processes a timer, I see the word timer but don't  know how to activate or led lights?No indication of weak charge and no indication it's charging or completed charge.
"
"
The timer feature is easy to use, and the battery life is incredible. I have gone about 3 days without charging this toothbrush and it still worked! I really recommend this.
"
"
Leaves your teeth feeling much cleaner than conventional brushing. If your teeth are sensitive, the vibration can be a little bothersome.
"
"
The difference between this and a manual toothbrush is day and night. Cleans between teeth and gums extremely well and leaves your mouth feeling so fresh after. The price dropped significantly since I bought it (last week), and I will be buying some more for gifts.
"
"
We liked this fine until it stopped charging. we ordered the extra brushes as well..now we,have many brushes and no charger.  Very disappointing.
"
"
I very happy my old one bit the dust . Like this one alot. Like a going through a. Car wash for your mouth love it the best .
"
"
Very pleased with this item. Espcially because it is on the low end of electric toothbrushes. I have never used electric but I love it. It is very powerful but my teeth have never felt cleaner!
"
"
The brush it came with was very hard on my sensitive teeth but when I switched it out for a softer brush it was great.
"
"
Works well, my teeth feel very clean.The vibration for the 2 minute mark was alarming. I just assumed the toothbrush would turn off, instead it is a series of vibrations.
"
"
j'en ai trois pareilles avec des têtes différentes. À 29.99$, c'est un peu moins cher que dans les magasins.
"
"
After long-term use of this product I have to lower the rating. This toothbrush is just too hard on the gums. It's excellent at cleaning teeth, but be careful it doesn't wear away your gums. Just had a teeth cleaning and they warned me about wearing my gums.
"
"
Great toothbrush, comes with one replacement.  About a 10 day charge to it.  Cleans up well.  I am having a hard time finding the double heads from replacement.
"
"
I chose this one after doing significant research on brushes in this price range.  Arrived to our address in the GTA within days of ordering, excellent product.  Girlfriend was using an Oral B Pro before this, and she likes this better.  Good seller
"
"
Works great, and the price is definitely more doable than the other electric brushes! As for the brush head, I'd rather go for one with a single rotaring unit instead. With the dual clean brush head, the bottom part just gets in the way.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush! Ordered because I needed a new toothbrush and this one had an awesome 20 dollar coupon so why not?! Super fast delivery and the toothbrush works amazing. I love that I can get a good quality electric without breaking the bank. This one does the trick for me, and really like the 2 min sensor it gives off.
"
"
I bought this to replace my old one of the same model.  I have had this just over one month and I already have to charge it every day.  It's a dud and too late to return it.
"
"
I first bought one of these for my husband.  After almost 2 years it's still working great, so I decided to order one for myself. This is an awesome toothbrush.  I highly recommend it.  I bought a cheap one before and it didn't last a year.  Don't buy a generic brand.  Trust in Oral B.
"
"
My Dentist is happy I bought this. You can feel that it's not playing around when it comes to cleaning your teeth, it applies some serious action!!I found that getting use to the round shape of the brush handle required some practice. Seems like a well made product. Shipping was fast, as well.
"
"
I quite love this product. I thought I was cleaning my teeth well before with a manual brush but boy was I wrong! This was recommended to me by my dentist because I have deep grooves in my cusps. The timer is a wonderful thing and my teeth are actually a couple of shades whiter. I'm never going back to manual!
"
"
This toothbrush is great. It is very affordable, which originally drew me to purchase it. The charging system is easy to use and the toothbrush is easy to use as well. Once you press the button, it automatically starts a timer and then makes a distinct vibration pattern to signify to you when it has been two minutes.
"
"
Use it daily.. pretty good .. I was lazy at manual brush, couldn’t brush my teeth for more than 10 seconds... so my dentist recommended this to me and now I only use electric brushes .. does a good job
"
"
I have had these for about 3 months and it stopped working.So the quality is not the best.It was working great a first.
"
"
My teeth used to be brown, green, and falling out.  Now they're sparkling clean white like a move star and not falling out. Absolute magic.
"
"
This is a replacement after using for many years.  I have always been satisfied and would highly recommend it.
"
"
It is what I wanted and I find it cleans better than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Used the brush a lot when it worked, Battery suddenly failed after 6 months.... Unable to recharge it
"
"
Has been working well. It's much better than manually brushing with a regular toothbrush. Doesn't need to recharge often - I charge mine once a week. You can tell when it's low on battery because it vibrates weaker compared to after it has been fully charged.
"
"
It's here to kick plaque and chew bubble gum... And it's all out of bubble gum....
"
"
Attention, le fil électrique à la base n'est pas étanche... pas évident pour la salle de bain! Moi, j'ai mis de la colle chaude pour rendre le joint étanche. Le mononc' est content.
"
"
This tooth brush is AWESOME ! For the price its an absolute STEAL ! My teeth feel way cleaner, and are noticeably whiter. For the price it is really a NO BRAINER. Solid product. Replacement heads are a bit costly, but never the less, great buy !
"
"
This seems to work well. I got it for my 14 year old son. Little loud, but he likes to use it to brush his teeth.
"
"
I'm not a big fan of this toothbrush. it doesn't clean the teeth very well
"
"
I love that it has a 2 minute timer while brushing.  I charged it for 24 hours before using it and it stayed charged for 5 days before I plugged it in again.  It cleans my teeth really well.
"
"
This is a really solid toothbrush and worth the purchase, cleans my teeth better than my pathetic non robot hands could.
"
"
I have used the Vitality for years. Way cheaper than the other Oral B toothbrushes but works just as well.
"
"
The two brush heads a game changer.  They are wonderful.  Will hacpve to ditch the one heads on hand.
"
"
Excellent product. Oral-B makes some of the best products I would say. Always try to buy the best for my family. Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush
"
"
I had the older one that lasted over 5 years and this is an improvement. Mt dentist is happier as well.
"
"
This toothbrush is very loud. It vibrates so intensely it hurts my mouth. It has also pinched my tongue and inside of my cheeks. I would not recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
Good buy！Cheap and works well! No need for any extra functions like what other 'high-end' models have, as I barely would need to use these extras...Simple is the best
"
"
Man for $30 CND this is an excellent brush, waterproof design, good performance, teeth feel polished all day. Big fan, best move i ever made moving from manual.
"
"
Only been a few weeks but overall I am very happy!
"
"
This rechargeable toothbrush satisfies all our requirements. It functions very well and is very stable on its stand while recharging.
"
"
Delighted I found a match to the one I have that's about to die. Expect this one will be every bit as good as the one it's replacing.

So far it works! Cleans them teeth up nicely. Yet to charge it so ill update with how long the rechargable battery lasts.
"
"
Works really well. The charging is really fast and stays charged for days. Come with an extra attachment.  Worth the money.
"
"
Bought these for my finacè and she absolutely love it. It’s easy to hold and does a thorough job in cleaning out your teeth. The timer feature is an added bonus. For the price and quality of the product, I definitely recommend.
"
"
Works great, my dentist loves that I'm using this one. Apparently, it's her favourite brand as well.
"
"
Simple, works well, appears well made.  Would buy again
"
"
Only had it for a couple of weeks.Impressed with power and speed. Seems well made.Hopefully it will last as long as my last Oral.B vitality.Definately buy again.
"
"
After having an electric toothbrush for years when I was young, I used manual tooth brushes for the past several years. I decided to switch after my dentist recommended going electric. So far it's been amazing. My mouth seems way fresher after every brush and the built in 2min timer is a nice added bonus!
"
"
This is such a great product for the price. Been using it for over 6 months and have absolutely 0 complaints
"
"
I love how easy it is to charge it with the provided base. Great toothbrush. You can feel the clean.
"
"
Feels like you just stepped out of your dentist's office. A must for all bathrooms
"
"
Not the one pictured. Was sent an older cheaper model
"
"
Arriving and responded to the complaint was perfect, I had tried two of them but they did not working properly and the battery would not last even for a minute, despite of charging enough.
"
"
Excellent does nice jobGood value
"
"
This is my second set (I also bought my fiance one, and she bought one for her mother). Highly recommended.
"
"
This toothbrush works great.  It cleans the teeth much better than a manual toothbrush.  The price is reasonable.  I'm happy with this purchase.
"
"
Bonne brosse à dents..... Mon garçon l'aime bien
"
"
Acheté ce produit en février 2019. La pile ne tient plus sa charge. Après une charge, la bosse ne fonctionne que pour une vingtaine de secondes.
"
"
Great value, good performance, still use it after 2 years. The first e-brush I had from Oral B laster 13 years. Yeah, this company produces durable, good working oral tools, which are totally waterproof.
"
"
Easy to use, just as expected. I find the turning noise to be louder than I expected. Overall, still great product for price.
"
"
Only thing I’m not happy with is that the $3.00 off coupon for replacement brush heads expired in 2018....
"
"
Brush is a good deal, and it works well, though replacement heads can be expensive - the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. The previous one I owned lasted about ten years, before the battery gave out.
"
"
Been using this product since August. First few full charges worked great and lasted the length they’re supposed to. A month later it cant hold a charge long enough for me to brush my teeth.
"
"
La troisième en 20 ans.
"
"
This tooth brush works very good. I would buy it again.
"
"
Everything works except for one major flaw. After one year the toothbrush becomes moldy.
"
"
Not as much as a savings as I thought it would be, cost in store not much more.  It's a grade lower than my last toothbrush.  I think my next one I will kick it up back up to the ""oral B"" like I had before.  OK but not more.
"
"
No problems with this product works great, a great basic electric tooth brush.
"
"
Don't need a $200 toothbrush, this works fine and has been going strong for over a year now.
"
"
One of the best electric toothbrushes I ever bought.  Dual action is amazing
"
"
Great toothbrush.  Works well and I love the new larger brush head.
"
"
Still holds a great charge. Works with a variety of value brush heads as well.
"
"
Kids love it
"
"
This is the most effective, less pricing toothbrush I had.  Cannot think of getting anything else than this one.  I recommend it all the way.
"
"
Works well.  I like the timer feature.
"
"
The first Vitality Oral-B I bought was made in Germany this one was made in Mexico the first purred this one is as noisy as a dentist's drill
"
"
The battery is amazing for me and i feel like its doing a really great and thorough job in brushing my teeth, leaving them like i just went to the dentist :) + you cant go wrong with the price !
"
"
Great quality and great price hold charge for a while
"
"
good and battery last and do a better job then a regular tooth brush
"
"
Cleans my teeth very well and its nice to have that little 2 min. reminder
"
"
Perfect Tooth brush, love it, has a chargeable stand and you can replace the heads
"
"
Not me I have one that plugs in
"
"
nice and easy to use. good cleaning job
"
"
Nothing bad about it, amazing price for what you get. Its sturdy and its very powerful, and considering a decent toothbrush costs around 12 bucks this thing is a steal. My teeth have never looked better.
"
"
So  far so good, only had it for a week, I can feel the difference between toothbrush & this Electric Toothbrush.  Recommend to everyone.  If I have any problems down the road I will update info.
"
"
My dentist suggested I get this and I finally did. Works great and I love the two minute timer! Comes with a replacement head too, which is really nice
"
"
Works great, even comes with an extra head!
"
"
Best toothbrush EVERRRR!!!My teeth feel so clean and smooth.It's like getting that after the dentist visit feeling every time you brush.
"
"
Good bruch, has it for awhile now, no issues.
"
"
For the price this brush is worth every penny glad I picked it.
"
"
Does the job.Battery has good autonomy.
"
"
Bought for a client and seems to be doing a good job and working alright.
"
"
eletrc toothbrush is with a charger ,no batteries needed
"
"
Great electric toothbrush, that is really affordable
"
"
Very good electric toothbrush. Cleans very well and the fact it's rechargeable, it means there is no more batteries to buy. The timer is very practical. I really like it.
"
"
so far so good
"
"
Love this product
"
"
Works fine, good quality for price
"
"
Son enjoys brushing his teeth with the electric toothbrush.  Ideal that it is rechargable and not battery operated.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush
"
"
Produit de très bonne qualité
"
"
Bought to replace my existing Oral B cordless toothbrush.  This one is much louder and the bristle seem more stiff on my sensitive teeth.The price was reasonable as I bought it on sale.
"
"
Too big for mouth and noisy
"
"
A bit more vigorous action than my Philips but the head is quite large.  When the 2 supplied heads are replaced it will be with the smaller size.  I found the on-off switch to be unusually hard to press.  A very good value overall.
"
"
La brosse va bien mais j’en prefere le bout round seulement
"
"
I bought this item as a Christmas present for my wife. She uses it daily and loves it.
"
"
Good product for the price, I'm very satisfied. I'm not a fan of the dual action part but the heads are interchangeable so it's not a real issue.
"
"
Both of us are very pleased with the performance of these toothbrushes...
"
"
Great product! Battery lasts very long! Will definitely purchase again!
"
"
Love it! Purchased 2 of these one for me and one for my wife. Cleans very good and easy to use - love the timer function.
"
"
Meilleur prix trouvé !Cette brosse à dent est vraiment génial je ne pourrait pas m'en passer
"
"
I bought this toothbrush back in December of 2013. One of the brush heads broke on me, but maybe expected after 5 months of use!  Haven't had any other issues with this toothbrush.
"
"
ORALB Vitality Electric Toothbrush is a powerful electric toothbrush for a reasonable price.
"
"
Great price , great product .
"
"
Great toothbrush you can feel the difference after you brush.. And comes with two heads perfect for me and the girlfriend
"
"
For the price, you can't go wrong! Love it!
"
"
Good, nice price, nice quality
"
"
Great toothbrush. Lots of power and does a great cleaning job
"
"
I had an oralB model that was a few years old, cost 5x as much, and broke down. When it came to replace it, I found this one. It costs way less, and does exactly what I used my fancy model for, but without all the bells and whistles. Works great.
"
"
Only lasts for 3 months and its dead
"
"
I like it. works great just like my other one
"
"
arrive on time.  product always hard to get out of package.
"
"
Fonctionne très bien
"
"
It's great. Does what you want it to & does it well. Recommended.
"
"
Great price, great product and quick delivery.
"
"
Easy to use. Efficient. Economical. No complaints.
"
"
Great price and excellent toothbrush
"
"
What can I say... it's a Braun!  My third and my teeth and gums feel nice and clean.
"
"
Great brush
"
"
Très bonne fonction comme on s'attendait.
"
"
Never going back to a regular brush, would like a longer battery life though.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush for the price! Much more powerful than the battery operated toothbrushes. No need to spend more.
"
"
The best toothbrush , period !
"
"
Great product.. Stays charged all the time..
"
"
Just what I needed! Used this for two weeks and my dentist even noticed a difference!
"
"
Bought this electric tooth brush to replace my old one that was over 5 years old. The battery in my old one was just too weak, the new one is awesome!
"
"
This toothbrush is easy to use, love the timer feature. It is light and the battery lasts about a week. Great value for the price!
"
"
Good product but the vibration isn't as good as it used to be after a year
"
"
My first electric toothbrush. Good power, easy to use (well its a toothbrush), timer is nice, recharge base is also nice... nothing to complaint about for now.Probably one of the best quality/price electric toothbrush
"
"
Bought this for my husband and he loves it! I wanted to know if he would like an electric toothbrush before I spend hundreds on them.
"
"
Works as it should.
"
"
Good
"
"
It is very good at what it is supposed to do  clean your teeth but you have to use it
"
"
Je suis très satisfait de mon achat.
"
"
Worth the money spent.Does pretty well..what its supposed to do.The only concern is the cost of brush heads.
"
"
Great toothbrush for a great price. So much better than a manual toothbrush and cleans much better. Good product, would recommend.
"
"
Stopped working 3 days in had to return. It was great while it worked though
"
"
excellent toothbrush.
"
"
good
"
"
Lost charger and can't use now.  Would prefer a bullt in chageable batterylworked great until needed recharging.
"
"
Everything went smooth, works and as described
"
"
Happy with this especially for the price.  You can use other heads which we are happy about as we are using for our child.
"
"
Like it so far. It was my first electric toothbrush. Found the head a little big, but get use to it now. The charge last. For 20$ it worth it! Love the 2mins timer.
"
"
This took me a couple of days to get used to and now I absolutely love it! My mouth feels so clean all the time.
"
"
The Oral-B arrived on time and the product works much better than the older unit I was currently using.
"
"
WE werent brushing our teeth often before buying those, but since, we brush more often and longer. So i guess it helped
"
"
Excellent produit livraison rapide
"
"
This is useful and it work well.
"
"
I've used these for years. Forgot mine when I left a hotel, glad amazon can ship them out quickly!
"
"
I have had one of these toothbrushes for over 5 years and use it every day and it's been awesome. Decided to buy another so I could have one in my drawer and another in the shower so purchased this one. It looks the exact same as my old one (blue and white) and not the all white version that is pictured so be warned. That aside, the new whitening brush head with the polisher does a way better job than my previous regular head and I could see an immediate difference in the colour of my teeth after one use and my teeth felt smoother, cleaner and polished.
"
"
I found manual toothbrushes to be enough to keep cavities away but not very efficient to fight off plaque and tartar. I was scared to try an electric toothbrush in case it was too rough for my teeth but I'm really happy I gave it a try. The first few days I used the toothbrush my gum bled a little bit but after that it was ok. I find that my teeth seem to be keeping that ""white look"" longer, despite drinking coffee or tea daily.Also,  it's really easy to use. I've not yet been able to brush under 2 minutes (there is a vibrating signal to let you know you reached 2 minutes of brushing) but I'm getting closer. It's really helpful to remind you to not overbrush.I'm only giving 4 stars because I  think a light indicator would have been a great addition to let us know when the electric toothbrush is charging and by how much.
"
"
The brushes that came with it rock.. Switching to this type. Teeth as smooth as a billiard ball. Also have the Ferrari version Oral B 7000 I think (my wife uses it). All four of us in the family prefer the new 3D - stronger without all the fancy gizmos - don't need 'em. Got the Jr. for my 2year old - gentler and she loves it.
"
"
This model is to replace an older similar model that became defective (with time, the rubber pad covering and surrounding the on/off switch wears off and a hole may appear, allowing water to seep in and creating issues with the operation of the toothbrush....no worries though, I would classify this as normal wear and tear as it took a  very, very long time for that problem to appear).Be aware that this package comes with two specialized 3D White brush heads, as correctly advertised here, but I didn’t really notice that they are meant for occasional polishing, certainly not for regular brushing as it has a tiny silicone polishing cup in the middle designed to remove surface stains such as coffee. So the feeling is rather rough and hard, not smooth. I wish they would have included a second more gentle Clean brush head instead of two of the same kind. In the instructions, there is a description for 7 different types of brush heads, so you can always pick the type(s) you want and order some (in the package are promotional coupons, one for $3 for a 2-or-more package of brush heads refill, and a $7 off-coupon to receive when you register your new toothbrush on Oral-B’s website)
"
"
The battery lasts way longer than the seller indicated.  And it does a better job than the one I had before, competitor brand that is touted as being much better.  I like that it doesn't just shut itself off after 2 min.  It lets you know, then keeps going.
"
"
This the perfect toothbrush for me. It takes me a little while to brush my teeth as suggested by my dentist, yet the charge lasts for a good length of time.  now have 2.
"
"
I like that it can be charged electrically so I don’t have to keep replacing batteries. It seems to be of good quality as it has 2 replacement heads which is great. I don’t like is that a protective cover wasn’t in the package so I could cover the part that goes in my mouth when not in use . Also a replacement head coupon is in the package which was expired almost 2 years now . I received it yesterday and I did have it charging for the time it should be charged like around 16 hours and no it’s working
"
"
I have had countless electric toothbrushes. This one was much cheaper and there is a. Reason for it. This one also doesn’t charge in a cradle and the batteries were DOA.Good for a vacation or a sleepover bag. The bristles wore out his quickly.It’s not the best daily electric toothbrush but gets the job done.
"
"
Would be nice if it would vibrate for each quadrant so my son would know when to switch over to the other quadrant. It stops at 2 minutes which is normal but doesn’t vibrate in-between that time like most automatic toothbrushes.
"
"
Medicare quality, however, cost-effective.The motor power is just sufficient and the handle quality is good.The charger mechanism is pleasant to use.

I've been buying this electric toothbrush model for years. The battery on my last one have up after 10 years. The battery life on this new model has improved quite a bit. It lasts me over a week without a charge, brushing twice daily. It's simpler than most models but cleans very well and does the job. I have braces, therefore my mouth hygiene is even more important now than before and I find that it leaves my mouth feeling quite clean. Definitely can't go wrong for the price either!
"
"
I spent years having plaque issues and my dentist was always telling me I need to spend more time brushing around the gums but ever since using this I haven't heard anything but good things. The vibrations remove plaque building and the different heads give you so many options for the kind of clean you want. I absolutely love it!
"
"
Very happy with this. Purchased knock-off heads that work great with it. Timer feature is nice but not necessary. Affordable enough that if there is an issue, I'd buy again.
"
"
I've been using this brush for the better part of 9 months. No issues, works great. Timer is a handy feature. Keeps you brushing longer! Replaceable brushes are easy to change. Would highly recommend.
"
"
Want an electric tooth brush without breaking the bank? Then this is the one to get. Its easy to use, has a great battery life and doesn't come with a slew of extra features.
"
"
Purchased as a gift. I like the product.  Oral b cleans teeth extremely well. I have had my current one for twenty some odd years and still going strong.
"
"
This so our 3rd and 4th set for kids , they love it, no problems so far
"
"
Works great, I haven't had it for long so I can't comment on how durable it is.. but I would say don't leave it on the charger because it effects its battery life.
"
"
Finally I have now joined my family. Love this works great. Fast, easy and the charger is perfect.
"
"
I have tried 3 times to charge my toothbrush, the battery will not hold a charge
"
"
Initially worked great and was happy with the purchase. But out of nowhere, with just over a week of use, it stopped working. Even after being left to charge overnight, it still won't turn on. Very disappointed.
"
"
This product's Description is incorrect.
"
"
Great price and fast shipping. Powerful brush with a nice brush head. Has a two minute timer. If you just want a basic electric toothbrush this is the one. Easy to use, easy to clean comes with two bush heads.
"
"
The first one I ordered got lost in the mail, I managed to get Amazon to ship me another one and it broke after a single use. And yes, I made sure it was properly charged. Just won't turn on. Frankly, I am not happy.
"
"
Great product super price very happy with purchase
"
"
Très satisfaits
"
"
Works as it should! Easy to use, great battery life. My teeth are happier now
"
"
Bought for my daughter, she really likes it
"
"
Better than battery operated
"
"
Boyfriend loves it
"
"
Great buy. Works amazingly.
"
"
Wow
"
"
Good product, but the brush head has a big piece of rubber that should be replaced by bristles
"
"
Great
"
"
I've owned the battery-operated toothbrushes before but I got tired of using up so many batteries. So wasteful and expensive. Oral B makes a quality brush and it comes with a recharging stand. Very nice.
"
"
Works great at a great price
"
"
Oral B est tres efficace oui je le recommande
"
"
Great product and fast delivery.
"
"
Battery lasts about 2 days, brushing morning and night time. Great buy for its price.
"
"
Excelent toothbrush
"
"
Exactly what I was expecting! Steal of a deal!
"
"
Good toothbrush.
"
"
Great value for the price! This toothbrush comes with 2 separate heads so you can replace them. Battery can last for an average of 4 days.
"
"
item arrived as described
"
"
Nice rechargeable toothbrush for the money paid.
"
"
Recommended by my dentist, like it very much and use it twice a day. It's definitely better than manual toothbrush.
"
"
Marche très bien
"
"
Great value for the price. Exact description.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Do NOT buy this, it stopped working mid way through my brushing, after like 30 seconds and I even charged it t make sure ad still doesn't work after just ONE day! don't waste your money
"
"
Great price
"
"
worked right out of the package  very fast delivery
"
"
Great toothbrush. No issues
"

WORTH THE BUY. I highly recommend this product. I have ordered one each for my family
"
"
Good product
"
"
As expected
"
"
Very satisfied
"
"
Worked for about a week and stopped working. Either battery or motor issue. Amazon says it’s ineligible for refund/replacement.
"
"
My teeth are better now because of this. I can smile now knowing that my teeth are clean. Seriously!
"
"
Great product.  Kids love it.
"
"
Reçus comme prévus
"
"
Good quality
"
"
Great product. No power adjustment so if your teeth are overly sensitive it may be too powerful. Very pleased
"
"
Bon article 👍👍
"
"
Excellent for travel as charger is compact.  Many options available for replacement brushes. Order arrived very quickly.
"
"
It has a strong motor with fairly good battery life.The 2 minute timer is super useful.
"
"
Good
"
"
They like them
"
"
I love my new Oral B toothbrush. The timer is a great.
"
"
Only two demolitional
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dent
"
"
Works great , too bad it only has one speed.
"
"
I received it before the estimated delivery date.
"
"
Works well at being a simple electric toothbrush, good value at $20.
"
"
Xmas gift for my son

This was for my husband and he loves it.
"
"
This brush is an excellent product and works very well.
"
"
Very good value for the money.
"
"
Easy to use
"
"
Easy to reach far hidden areas.
"
"
Probably the best toothbrush I have ever used for the money spent
"
"
Great toothbrush.
"
"
Nice clean feel.
"
"
Parfaitement ce que je cherchais! Très bon prix!
"
"
It works fine.
"
"
It's ok - the price isn't bad, but given the fact that it doesn't even have a light to indicate that i's charging and it's nickle metal battery, i'd expect the price to be in the low 20's.  the fact that it doesn't have a charge indicator is annoying.  That said, it does come with an extra brush head, which bumps up the value a little, but just feels a tad too high.  should have been around $26-27.  What's is interesting is that Oral-B markets this same model and various different packages at different price points, such as the Pro 500 which is $45 and is the same model but build in Germany, as opposed to Mexico, and doesn't come with an extra brush head - even poorer value.Any with respect to the Vitality, i don't think i'm a fan. This brush sort of hits a strange price segment for me.  The unit just feel's too cheep, like i's a tooth brush for kids or teens. Doesn't have standard features like a charge light, or lithium which holds a better power curve then Nickel Metal.  Given a device that you should be using at-least twice a day, i'd like something that feels better quality, better features, and more power.  It feels under powered to me, like it's only got 65-75% of the power of a high end brush.  So, would i recommend this? No, not unless you're looking for a brush for you kids or teens.  If you're an adult and have any extra expendable cash i'd opt for a more powerful feature rich model, and not necessarily from this manufacturer - their are various alternative manufacturers.  This really comes down to the feel - do you want to spend 4-5 minutes a day with something this basic, or something that feels more substantial.  It's like driving a subcompact to work every day, versus something that got leather seats, etc..  treat yourself and opt for something nicer.

Decent brush for the cheap price this electric toothbrush will not break the bank like others will and works just as good as the other ones. It is a good brush to get you into the electric realm of tooth brushing it is a plain brush with no bells and whistles like the more expensive ones it does the job well the battery lasts for awhile. It is also a good brush to take traveling with you as again the price is cheap so if you lose it or forget it it is not he end of the world so this is a great add on to your travel bag  and can get one for each of your family members still spending less then you would on one of the more expensive brushes. Over all great brush cheap works well

Switching to electric toothbrushes many years ago was one of the best things I did for my teeth and my first brand was Oral B. I have been a faithful user of their electric toothbrushes and find them to usually be good value.I would definitely suggest investing in an electric toothbrush as I feel they do a much better job at cleaning and removing plaque, film and tartar compared to manual ones. I’ve tried several different brands of electric toothbrushes of varying value and power over the years and I feel that for $30 - $40, this electric toothbrush just isn’t worth the price. I find it really has no redeeming features other than being better than a manual toothbrush and the fact that it comes with two brush heads as opposed to just one. I would much prefer a charging gauge and/or variable speeds available, as these features are very useful to me.PROS+ Affordable price+ Includes 2 brush heads+ Rechargeable base takes up minimal space+ Features a 2 minute timer to ensure thorough cleaning+ Full charge lasts about a week (if you brush about 4 min/day + don’t put it back on the charger daily)CONS- No charging indicator- No variable speedsI invested about $80 about 8 years ago into a good Oral B electric toothbrush with variable speeds and a charging indicator and I feel the initial investment was well worth the price. It lasted over 5 years. I feel the investment into a better model of Oral B electric toothbrush is more than worth an extra $30 - $50 . I would advise looking into more feature rich Oral B brushes before going for this budget brush.

Pros:- Good value- Built-in 2 minute timer- No-fuss charger- Polishing head- Aggressive cleaningCons:- Hard plastic clamshell packagingOn my recent long weekend trip to Ottawa, I figured this would be a good time to give this product a trial run. After fumbling with different sharp objects to cut through the plastic packaging, I finally had freed my toothbrush.Everything that you will need is included in the box, including a coupon to take $3 off your next purchase for replacement brush heads. If you register your toothbrush, you even get an additional $7 off coupon. The charger seems quite solid and definitely can withstand being thrown in your suitcase. The toothbrush itself is waterproof, so you can focus on keeping the dribble off of your shirt instead of off of the toothbrush. The handle fits comfortably in my hand, and the grippy texture on the toothbrush kept it from sliding around in my hand. As far as brushing goes, it was a pleasant experience. The toothbrush wasn’t overly powerful, and was able to break up the leftovers from the previous meal. The head does have a stiffer plastic polishing cup that polishes the teeth and gets rid of any surface staining. The integrated 2 minute timer is nice as it ensures you meet the minimum suggested brushing time, especially if you don’t want to bother timing yourself.

 === Introduction ===The Oral B vitality is a good value/budge electric toothbrush. Below, I have included a video video and loads of pictures to help you with your purchase decision.=== PROS (+) ===+Replacement brush head included (two brushes total);+Wall charge with charging stand included+Discount coupons included for future brush purchases;=== CONS (-) ===-Press & brush; lacks pre-programmed brush options compared to direct competitors;-Feels like I have to do extra work/movements to clean properly compared to leading competitor d=== CONCLUSION ===***Note*** You must charge the Oral B toothbrush for 16 hours the first time around.Overall, this is a decent electric toothbrush however I prefer investing into the top-of-the-line electric toothbrush, given that adult teeth do not regrow - you only have one set of teeth, so invest in keeping them clean with top the best products, if your budget allows it, of course.The Oral B Vitality works well however it lacks option - as a budget toothbrush based on the $39 price point, I am giving this experience 4 stars.

In using this toothbrush, I discovered I'm not a fan of electric toothbrushes.  The vibration gives me a headache and it feels like someone is jackhammering or doing construction work inside my mouth. That being said, I'm reviewing this for the results it gave, because although I won't use this any more, if these factors won't bother you (noise, vibration), then this brush delivers results.After brushing your teeth for the full two minutes (there's a little chime that lets you know when 2 minutes have passed), your teeth feel dentist-clean and really smooth. This is a feeling I don't get from a regular manual brush.It's pretty good value for money too because inside the package (which was dreadful clam shell packaging which took 6 minutes to open) was an extra new brush head and a $10 off coupon if you registered your tooth brush.The brush is really simple - it charges on a cradle. There's no charging indicator light. There is only one speed (powerful) and one on/off button. So it's pretty bare bones. But it does the job. I just won't be using mine for the reasons mentioned above. But if you're looking for an inexpensive electric toothbrush, this will fit the bill.Hope this review is helpful.

I really like Oral-B brushes in general because I find their round head cleans betterthan a regular traditional brush head.This is my favorite of the Oral-B  brushes I've tried and the value of it is hard to beat. This brush is more powerful that the Oral-B 500 I tried but much less expensive even though it comes with a replacement head as well.While I found some brushes not powerful enough or needing constant charging; this brush has neither of those problems. I can go several days without charging this brush and it still is powerful enough to keep going, even when I apply pressure to it; it keeps rotating.I find my teeth look shiney and polished while feeling refreshingly clean.  I love this brush and it has been my go-to brush ever since it arrived. Love it!

The Oral-B Vitality 3D White is an affordable electric toothbrush. It has none of the bells and whistles of my main toothbrush, but that's OK - it does a great job at what it is meant to do, and that is to agitate the brush head as you move it along your teeth. The included tips are polishing tips with a small rubber cup in the centre, surrounded by bristles. I actually really like the polishing tips. The brush will indicate when 2 minutes have passed by briefly cutting out operation, so you know you can stop. There's a charge cable included, which the handle just sits on to charge up. If you're looking for a good, affordable, no-frills electric toothbrush with replaceable tips, go for this one!

I will never go back to using a manual tooth brush!  This works so well.  Batteries will hold charge for a very long time if brushing 1-2 times daily for 60 seconds.  The standardized heads let's you use for any new brush you may buy from oral B.  They have these personalized coloured rings for his/her or siblings.  When using you don't have to work your arm to much because the tooth brush does all the work.  We get much brighter and whiter smiles and fresher breath using an automatic brush like this.  Works wonders, honestly we'll never go back to manual.
"
"
This toothbrush works very well and has the added benefit of having a very small footprint.A charge last me roughly 1 week brushing on average 3 times per day.  The included brush heads work as advertised easily removing coffee stains.Overall this is a great package for anyone wanting an electric toothbrush setup more specific to stain removal.
"
"
This Oral-B toothbrush Works really well for price point and 2 min timer is a great feature. Bristles on toothbrush is pretty jeneric to me. But if your on a budget it's not a bad option.  Also I do find it a bit louder than the one I own now.Good for those on a budget.
"
"
Battery lasts a fair amount of time. Great 2 minute feature. Nice basic electric toothbrush. Try it out!
"
"
I bought this toothbrush on black friday so they were discounted to $18 for my 2 boys. I have noticed when my oldest who is 11 uses it he has to brush his teeth 2 -3 times to get them clean. I changed the head and used it and was incredibly disappointed. I mean it works for small children but as they get bigger I wouldn't use it. It didn't leave my mouth feeling clean. Very disappointed in this product.
"
"
I purchased this unit as a replacement for my previous Oral-B brush. It even uses the same charger as my previous brush and my previous brush was over 5 years old. I love the fact that re-use my previous charger.I don't like the fact that there is no charging LED on the charger or handle but that's okay with me given the low price.
"
"
Wow... i had no idea how lame my old toothbrush was.  It was an oral b .. but one of those battery operated spin brushes.  This brush cleaned my teeth and as everyone else noted.. i felt like i just left the dentist chair.  Love the 2 minute vibration.. letting you know you actually brushed for 2 min rather then a fast buzz across the fangs.  So worth the money... bought one for the man as well.
"
"
I bought this as a replacement to the Oral-B electric of mine that died over time (battery wouldn't retain charge). Unfortunately I didn't realize how much lower the quality of this unit is compared to what i used to have. This unit only has one speed and it is to shred your gums until they bleed. It's actually very uncomfortable to use. That being said, it is operational and hasn't broken down in the 4 weeks I've used it.
"
"
I chose this basic model because I just didn't think I had to complicate brushing my teeth with all kinds of fancy features. Gets the job done adequately and I really do feel like my teeth are cleaner when I use this versus my usual toothbrush. Feels like less of a chore as well
"
"
I have used this brand of tooth brush for many years and am happy with the quality of the product and most importantly how it cleans my teeth.I was very impressed with how quickly it arrived.  The delivery service is impressive!
"
"
My wife has one similar and Oral B makes a really good product.  The price was great, the delivery was fast and the toothbrush works just as good as my older one.  love the new stand and the over all style.  Great product as usual from Oral B
"
"
I helped form a habit to brush twice everyday. Thanks to my hygienist that recommended it. Especially the two minute reminder is awesome.I am sure next time I see her she will be thrilled.UPDATE: one of them is having difficulty charging to full for the last week or so. Don't know what to do.
"
"
Works as advertised, only issue is toothpaste can build up around the base of the brush meaning you have to take the head off after every use or toothpaste will be stuck under there.
"
"
I had this toothbrush for a month and it works well but the bristles cause micro abrasions on my gums.
"
"
My first electric toothbrush and I think it's great. Battery lasts 2-4 days, but the charge stand makes easy to charge.  It's a little loud, but not too bad.  Bought it when it was on sale, so it was a great deal.
"
"
Did not received Oral-B Vitality toothbrush as pictured in Amazon.ca. The one we received did not have a separate ""Off"" button, but toothbrush is working as expected.
"
"
Was a gift and they have had for over 6 months and it is still working great. Easy to use I would definitely buy one again.
"
"
Perfect for price. A really good value. Not lots of bells and whistles with this electric tooth brush. But does the job. Bought for my kids and they are very happy.
"
"
Purchased for my sons to care for his braces. Works great to get in and behind all the apparatus parts. Maintains a charge for a long time.
"
"
The on/off button is way to hard to find, would have been good to have a proper raised button that you can feel easier!
"
"
Purchased to replace one that I already have.These are very good brushes, and I would recommend them.
"

Came fast love it...new gen more powerful than the one that has last me 10 years....great products!

I have the more expensive $250 Genius 8000 Oral-B toothbrush, and my 8 year old daughter has the Kids Oral-B toothbrush. My wife uses this Vitality 3D toothbrush.The best thing about using this line of toothbrushes is that the charger is compatible with all of them!Instead of having 3 separate chargers, we can just use 1 charger for all of them. (When travelling though you should take an extra charger with you since the Kids brush doesn’t hold a charge very well)The Vitality 3D holds it’s charge for over a week! That’s about the same time as the Genius 8000.For the price, you can’t get a better value.The good thing about the Oral-B line as well is that there are generic brands that make cheaper replacement heads than the official Oral-B heads, and they seem to work just as fine on all 3 of our brushes.We’ve been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes for almost a year now.If you’re looking for an entry level electric toothbrush that’s not going to break the bank, that will be better than an analog brush, then I recommend this product.The 2 minute timer feature on all of the brushes is a great way to know how long you should brush for.We don’t really have any complaints about this brush.Although we prefer Philips Sonicare over Oral-B, the Sonicare is much more expensive, the chargers aren’t compatible with each other, and the Philips brush heads are more expensive as well.

I will be honest that this is my first time using electric toothbrush and I DID NOT LIKE IT. The problem I have is the speed. I certainly will need to get use to it. There is nothing wrong with the brush. It is a renowned company, solid make, nice grip, small head, however, not happy with the speed.I did not put any pressure, but the head was spinning soooo fast, it would hurt my teeth/gum. I am not sure if I continue using this head, it may damage my gums long term.I may have to change the head and see if it will make any difference. I will post again, with a different head to see if it made any difference** Edit original review - I did change the head Oral-B Deep Sweep Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head 3 Count and after brushing for few days continuously, I am getting used to the speed and changing the review from 3 to 4 stars - Happy customer!

TL;DR Summary:Pros (+):+Excellent value+Rechargeable+2 minute timer+Trusted BrandCons (-):-Expensive to replace brush headsRead the full review for more.================Product Quality:Excellent. Packaged well and branded well.================Performance:Excellent. I love the 2 minute timer on this! You would think that adults know to brush for at least 2 mins – but you’d be surprised. Luckily with the built in timer, this isn’t an issue and it works perfectly. This product really promotes healthy teeth! One drawback is the fact that when it comes time to replace the head, you’re better off sometimes buying another new set (if you can find it on sale) because it is fairly expensive to get the replacement heads. Keep this in mind if you purchase this toothbrush.================Overall:Great product, and it helps us obtain a healthier mouth. The 2 minute timer is my favorite feature by far!=======================Rating Breakdown (5/5)Product Quality: 5Ease of use: 5Performance: 5Value for Money: 3Overall: 4.5

Okay, I've tried a lot of different electric toothbrushes from cheapie, quasi-disposable ones that take AA batteries to high-end ultrasonics.The Oral-B Vitality line is my go-to brush - it's not expensive, has a rechargeable battery that goes about a week between charges and tends to last a few years before the whole brush needs to be replaced.FEATURES & PROS* 2 minute timer (buzzes when 2 minutes are up)* oscillating rotary brush head, small diameter for getting into tight spots* use twice a day with a good toothpaste and you can keep tartar and stains from building up on your teeth, far more effectively than manual brush* makes biannual cleanings at the dentist a breeze - less for them to scrape off* multiple compatible head styles; the included heads have little rubber cups at centre, very similar to the ones dentists use for polishingPro-tip: don't use too much pressure when cleaning! Let the oscillating action do the work. This will also make the brush last longer.If I had any complaints about the Vitality, it's only that it's not *quite* up to the same level of cleaning as higher-end ultrasonic brushes but that's not really a fair comparison given the price differences and the Vitality doing about 90% of the same job.I never felt a manual brush got my teeth perfectly clean, even after 5 minutes of scrubbing where 2-minutes with the Vitality does a great job.In short, if you're still using a manual brush, ditch it for a Vitality, today.

Fantastic entry level electric toothbrush. Don't mistaken this product, it's a basic entry level electric toothbrush, great for anyone who is curious about electric toothbrushes or for children and teenagers. It gets the job done and keeps your teeth clean. It comes with two brushes with indicators to distinguish the two if you're sharing. It also has a 2 minute timer to changes the vibration to let you know you've been brushing for 2 minutes, the recommended amount of time to effectively remove plaque and grime from your teeth.Some other reviews have mentioned that they want a charge indicator or a li-ion batter, while those would be a nice feature, this toothbrush works great the way it is. It's meant to stay sitting in it's charger and plugged in, you'll always have a full charge to brush your teeth. I've never run into a situation where I ran out of power, even if I left it off it's charger for a few days.
"
"
Firstly I'd like to state I was given this product in return for an unbiased review.I opened the package and noticed right away that the brush came with an extra brush replacement, that is a plus for me. It comes with a stand with a cord attached to it for the toothbrush to dock to. It doesn't appear to have any contacts for charging, but it would have to charge it. Again, I'd like to state that there is no indication of it charging, but it would have to be.First use, the toothbrush feels powerful and it feels like it is cleaning well. There's a little polishing cup in the center that I was actually kind of excited about, and I don't get excited about cleaning my teeth lol. The brush head is smaller and fits way back behind my back teeth which are usually not reachable. When I finished, my teeth felt very clean. Cleaner than I can usually get them.In conclusion this toothbrush will be seeing alot of use, it's not quite like the other spinbrush toothbrushes. I would recommend this to anyone I know if they asked me what toothbrush they should get.

Quick Review:This is the 1st electric toothbrush I've ever tried so I am far from an expert here. My impressions after 2 months are fairly positive.First off it's exceptionally easy to use....press a button and away it goes. It also has a 2 minute timer built in so you know that you've brushed long enough. I kind of like that feature...it makes sure the I am being honest when brushing lol.It did take a few weeks for me to adjust to the smaller head but it does a better job of cleaning individual teeth for sure. The head has a small polishing cup for removal of surface stains and for whatever reason my teeth truly do feel cleaner when using this brush.Price seems fair for what you are getting and it comes with 2 heads (you can also buy different styles of heads)This is a basic unit but it does what it needs to do...
"
"
This is the perfect toothbrush for kids. I used to buy my son the kind with cartoon characters on them, but the oscillation isn't nearly as effective as the Oral-B with rotating head. Once we switched him, we noticed a marked improvement in staining on his front teeth.It's easy to use. No vigorous motions needed. You just run it along your teeth and gumline until it indicates 2 minutes have passed (the dentist said 1 minute is fine for baby teeth.) Make sure you use sensitive or extra gentle brush heads for kids.The best part is how long a single charge lasts. This one outlasts my own more expensive version by at least 3 times!
"
"
Right when i received this in the mail i was so excited to open it. I opened it and noticed i received an extra brush head and i was really happy with that. The toothbrush is built well and is rather cheap. The toothbrush feels powerful and it feels like it is doing a very good job in cleaning in which it is. When i had finished brushing my teeth they felt cleaner than usual which is a sign that this toothbrush is excellent. I do recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs one or even wants one. I love it
"
"
I have several Oral B battery powered units alike them all.Thought I'd try a rechargeable, and so glad I did.This is a steal on Amazon and I plan to buy more.
"
"
I did not like this toothbrush too much. The spinning causes so much splash it gets really messy. The charge started to fail after a few weeks I felt like the brush was getting weaker and weaker. It also takes so long to brush because the head is tiny and the bristles are kinda sparse. Not at all impressed
"
"
If you've never used an electric toothbrush, you're severely missing out. This thing allows you to get into those places often missed by using a conventional toothbrush.The price is great and affordable, as well are the replacement heads.Tip: Don't turn the brush on until it's in your mouth. Trust me on that.
"
"
This is a great value for a great toothbrush. It works as well as any other Oral-B electric toothbrushes but at a better value. When you compare this to the Oral-B 500 it costs less, has an extra head (this has two where as the 500 has only one), and the heads it comes with have the built in gum massager. You can't go wrong with this.
"
"
So far i have enjoyed using this more than my more expensive (but older model) Soniccare tooth brush.  It's lightweight and soft tipped and i like the 2 minute timer that's automatically on the brush.  Only been using it for 2 days now but it will be my primary tooth brush going forward.

Oral-B Vitality 3D White Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush - by Oral B.- Price, Ability and Quality, Great Battery, 2 great brush heads and a Top Notch Brand, make this a great score!.Some of the features are: (This Head, which is swap-out-able) is polishing cup for removal of surface stains for a naturally whiter smile.while having the bristles on the outside so the tartar is also attended to - and is is on slightly oval shape for slightly better tooth coverage.The Squeegee style rubber cup & round brush head is mush like the dentists polishing an cleaning style of professional dental tools.Just press it up against the tops and sides of your teeth and guide it over the tooth and Voila - Brushed & Cleanined and Polished.. it has the automatic IN BRUSH 2 Minute Timer: that Signals after two minutes with a couple of quick automatic stops and then restarts, thus signaling the 2 minute mark - but it help you brush for the recommended brushing time - but you can brush more if you like.But that is the minimum recommended time, so that is 1/2 a minute per quarter mouth..- The Back of the Brush has a slight rubber surface and textures for Grip Assistant Surface & Texture - helps when getting things wet.- There is no light on this model to indicate it is charging.- it this particular one, it has the circle indents on the bottom for tiny round rubber feet, but they seemed to have forgotten them.- The On / Off button is Rubber Covered much like a Hand Blender, so it is waterproof - So Splash Like Crazy - No Problemo.- There is only 1 speed, but really - does that matter? it is very well prices so if a Light and being 2 speeds cuts the price, then Great! Right?¿ ?-The vbase takes only a small area so it is practically space saving.-The Head itself is MARVELOUS! Acts just like the Dentists Rubber Polishing Head! Words Great! Yet the outer bristles do the rest well enough.- IT is a Changeable Head and there are many to choose from, so pick your own choice of different Brush heads and live it u :-)- THis is Rechargable that should last a Very very long time - Its Ni-Hi - Nickel Metal Hydride, wch is put into the top longest lasting holding the charge longest batteries available - so this is a GOOD - VERY Good Rechargeable Toothbrush Handle - So they last a long long time.- It comes with 2 of these Squeegee with bristles heads - and that alone is a Good Cost Saving Factor.Overall - This is a VERY Decent Score. OH - and the 2nd toothbrush head is separately packaged and sealed an comes with a color identifying head so you can each ( 2 people) switch heads and stay sanitary and know one is white ringed and the other yellow ringed.- 2 year guarantee from the company in both USA and Canada! VERY DECENT indeed!_ I would say: BUY A COUPLE EXTRA AS PRESENTS!.- Price, Ability and Quality, Great Battery, 2 great brush heads and a Top Notch Brand, make this a great score!

Great feeling toothbrush! Very light and the head is super soft. I love they I can reduce environmental waste/pollution by using bamboo toothbrushes and you really can’t beat the price for this many in a pack! My husband and I will be using these especially when we travel. I would recommend to friends and family. Oh and quick delivery as always from this vendor.
"
"
These are WOW. I'm never using another kind of toothbrush.We're going towards the no-waste path and so we wanted something that was more eco friendly, but I wasn't expecting these to be that nice. And for 10 toothbrushes, the price is hard to beat.
"
"
Felt as soft as a plastic extra soft toothbrush. I like that its biodegradable and somewhat better for the environment. The head/brush does need to be cut off and placed in a regular bin. I haven't tried this yet, but I imagine that it should be fairly easy.4 stars because it feels strange to hold (lighter than I'm used to), and also don't feel that charcoal infused brushes are absolutely necessary for brushing.
"
"
i love that this is eco friendly.  as we do travel lots this is a great toothbrush to bring along anywhere.  great price for a 10 pack.  feels more comfortable than using a regular plastic toothbrush and the bristles feel way better on the teeth.

Love these toothbrushes. I have sensitive gums and the bristles are extra soft. Leaves my mouth feeling very clean. Will definitely buy again.
"

I have incredibly sensitive teeth and have been on the hunt for a good super soft toothbrush for quite a while. These fit the bill!! Super soft and comfortable to hold. Also aesthetically pleasing! Great price too

I've tried two other brands of bamboo toothbrushes. They were flat handled ones.This one has more control and fits in the hand better. I would buy this again. But seeing as there's 10 I don't think I'll need to for a while.

"
"
Not for me. I found the bristles too soft and the tips of the bristles too sharp. My gums feel aweful after using them. There's a little bit of an aftertaste. The handles are too skinny for my preferences. Questionable how much plastic I'm actually saving too: I mean 4-5 sq inches of plastic every two months... probably not going to save the world by switching to bamboo. Oh well. I tried. Maybe others will like them better. The price isn't crazy if you want to try them. Not a total loss - I have a sustainable cleaning tool for the bathroom.
"
"
My girlfriend was in the market for an electric toothbrush but the price of name brands at the big box stores are too steep, she opted for a cheaper version. SHe mainly picked this one because it is pink (lol) but it actually works well! The bristles are not too stiff, it's soft enough, similar to the soft toothbrushes, and it comes with two brush heads.

I have very sensitive teeth and this toothbrush really helps me. I like the way my teeth feel after using it. Not to mention it doesn't cause me any sensitivity as some other toothbrushes have to me in the past as I have sensitive gums. The colour is super cute too! I got mine in Pink! love it!
"
"
Good quality and impressive toothbrush.It is soft and flexible which makes it easy to reach use. Nice design and battery life is good so far.  This is the one to get.
"
"
Very well built, came with 8 brush heads, and a travel case.Great value, very happy with the purchase.USB charging, can be used with worldwide electricity voltage, great to travel with.
"
"
This is the best electronic toothbrush I ever had. After using it, I can feel that my teeth are really clean. And it comes with a travel case which is very convenient. In addition, the price is fair. I will recommend this to my friends.
"
"
Best toothbrush I have ever owned. Would recommend this to anyone that asked can't say how much its changed my schedule and I now brush more than I ever have before!
"
"
I love this item. I don’t keep it plugged in and it will last over a month so battery life is really good. I like that it gives me 1 sec pause after each 30 seconds. Most importantly my teeth feels clean.
"
"
the electric toothbrush  works great
"
"
Just received today. Couldn’t wait to open and see. Wow! Definitely worth for the price. Very good quality and very powerful. Highly recommended👍
"
"
I love how soft the bristles are even though I feel a deep cleaning. I like all the different settings too. It is light weight and pretty. Would buy again!
"
"
My girlfriend was in the market for an electric toothbrush but the price of name brands at the big box stores are too steep, she opted for a cheaper version. SHe mainly picked this one because it is pink (lol) but it actually works well! The bristles are not too stiff, it's soft enough, similar to the soft toothbrushes, and it comes with two brush heads.

I purchased this for my elderly mother as a Christmas gift. I was super excited after reading the reviews.This brush does not get in between the teeth, the bristles do not rotate, it just buzzes. IT DOESNT DO ANYTHING!what is the point of an electric brush if you have to do the work?
"
"
This toothbrush only worked twice and now won’t charge anymore. Not happy with this purchase.
"
"
Toothpaste does not stay on, it vibrates across the room, I apply paste to my teeth then toothbrush to teeth. Small area of bristles, so pretty to look at and comfortable handle, love how it looks in my bathroom,  l like how my teeth feel after
"
"
I just love this and it works well  and is a beautiful colour~ Martha
"
"
Great colour, quiet, easy to hold and maneuver. Problem is with shutting it off, and light stays red even after charged, I will read the pamphlet info again. Seems good so far, just got it yesterday so I've only used it a couple of times....
"
"
wife loves it so far. Loves the color as well as what it does. Price was very competitive too, which helps. It is her  first electric brush so she can't compare it, but enjoys it more than a regular brush as she claims it cleans better.

these work just fine as a toothbrush but the head seems excessively small. I would have thought it was for a child. I'll be trying to find a larger head toothbrush.

It's 2017, what the heck kind of toothbrush doesn't have a tinge scraper on the back of the head?! This kind, apparently.

I always use this toothbrush, it fits my teeth!

Don't waste your money on the Diamondcare line. This brush does exactly the same thing (i've owned them both) and costs far less. I'm very happy I saved money the second time around by not wasting it on the fancy version.
"
"
It's all the toothbrush you could need. I've had friends with the higher version with the bluetooth and whatnot, but even he said to get any more than this is a waste of money.This toothbrush is excellent and you'll be happy you got it.
"
"
I have tried a few brands of electric toothbrushes, and Sonicare is by far the best. My mouth is as clean as if I just visited the dentist - but every time I brush.This model is the perfect blend of cost/features. It has a gum mode which I needed, and nothing else fancy. Would highly recommend buying off-brand replacement heads from Amazon if you are on a budget.
"
"
Not to sure if I just got a bad unit or if they are all like this but after a month of owning it the battery only lasts one day. Additionally if you leave the toothbrush on the charger every time someone enters the bathroom it makes a loud beeping sound that can be annoying for guests. There are lots of electric toothbrushes on amazon I'd recommend buying a different one.
"
"
OMG! Im so happy i bought this toothbrush!!...its my first electronic one and i finally feel my teeth are actually clean!! My manual toothbrush wasnt cutting it anymore and so much plaque was starting to build up...in my first use it was all gone! I love Philips products they are great quality and the battery was charged which was super convenient and it lasts too....it is very quiet yet powerful and i love the travel case it comes with!
"
"
Cleans my enamel well!Feels like a much better and thorough clean than when I use just a regular toothbrush.I like the 30 second reminder to change quadrants when brushing. Prevents wasting time brushing teeth and ensures equal time brushing throughout your mouth.
"
"
I bought this Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean Toothbrush 4500Toothbrush under the suggestion of my dental. It's high efficiency and not harmful to teeth, and easy packing for travlling. I like it. The only  pity is that I found there is a Toothbrushand Air Floss Bundle after I bought it. If the seller can add Air Floss Bundle HX8331/01, Iwill be very happy and would like to pay the price difference!
"
"
After a couple of months, one of the sections (it buzzes differently to notify you to change location in the mouth, to end up cleaning every side of the mouth - I like that!) started buzzing differently, as if it was slowly starting to break down. Now I can only use it for 1.5 mins at a time instead of 2. I need to let it ""rest"" for at least 5 hours to work ok again...for 1.5 mins...
"
"
Completely satisfied. I always use this brand of electric brush. It does exactly as I need. I almost was suckered into the expensive ones with extra vibration modes... But who really has time to change their modes up. Just use this one and you'll be happy and get a good value. Battery lasts quite long.
"
"
Been using Sonicare for years and can’t live without one. Was time to replace mine - went for the black instead of white this time around and love it. Don’t waste your money on the fancy/expensive models... this one is fabulous and does the exact same thing and will last you years.

I've been using this toothbrush for a few months now, and I do prefer it over manual toothbrushes. It's able to reach and clean places that I otherwise couldn't. My complaint would be regarding the design, the light that's constantly on - it doesn't need to be. As well, the toothbrush head has gotten very loose in its attachment to the handle.
"
"
I didn't know how great an electric brush could work. I always considered myself through when cleaning my teeth with a manual brush. However, this product makes your teeth feel cleaner without a lot of pressure. In fact the product will warn you if you brush too hard.
"
"
This one was on sale so I bought it and I'd have to say I love it! The battery life is great, love that you get a travel case, and my teeth immediately feel so clean! Super happy with this product and I'll definitely be sticking to it. I've used Oral-B electronic toothbrushes in the past and while those are really good as well, I actually prefer this one. The only thing I found was a little off was the ergonomics but it was minor and just took a little getting used to. Other than that, I highly recommend this product!
"
"
I had a Sonicare Diamond Clean which was excellent until it went berserk.  Replaced it with this 4500 model.  The 4500 is not of the same quality.  It feels to be made of lower quality materials, is lighter, feels less ergonomic in my hand and makes a lot more noise.  It also switches to massage mode randomly sometimes.  It’s ok but I will Go back to the higher model as soon as I can.
"
"
This is my second sonicare. They do a great job and the battery lasts forever. I bought this model because of the travel case. I hate it when it’s buzzing in your bag. Also it works on 220v in Europe.
"
"
I love this toothbrush I used it the first time last night my teeth felt so clean. I had another electric toothbrush before this and my teeth never really felt perfectly clean after using it. When I use this toothbrush my teeth felt shiny smooth and clean
"
"
Bought this to replace an old sonic toothbrush. I haven’t had it long (haven’t even charged it yet and I’ve had it a week), but I’m happy with it so far. It arrived quickly and works well.
"
"
Love this tooth brush. Get a dentist office clean feeling every day. It took a couple days to get used to the feel of it, but after the second brushing I could see and feel the difference in my teeth. It's a little noisy, but not too bad
"
"
Took the switch from a manual tooth brush and I have no regrets. Every time I brush my teeth, it feels really clean just like coming back from the dentist. The brush cycle is 2 mins long and it can go many weeks without charging.
"
"
Would recommend this product! Battery life is great, much better than oral-b. I get about a month of battery life with this. Comes with one gum brush.
"
"
Usually last around a week before it needs a charge. Takes a while to charge so a simple backup brush for when this is charging is handy to have.
"
"
Never thought I'd spent this type of money on a toothbrush, but you can't put a price on your health. Every time I use it, my mouth feels so clean. Its worth every penny; Sonicare is the brand to go for if you want an electric toothbrush.
"
"
I can't imagine a better toothbrush.  The battery nevers dies.  It just works, and works well.
"
"
La brosse à dent est excellente, cependant l'étui de voyage ne se ferme pas. Très ""cheap"" comme étui de transport. De plus, la brosse vient seulement avec une tête: je conseil de vous en procurer une deuxième.. bonne qualité, mais un peu trop dispendieux pour le contenu.
"
"
Very good toothbrush. It has timer on how long you brush your teeth.
"
"
Works great! Very sleek appearance, and just the right number of options. The quadpacer is my favourite feature, love that it gives a notification every 30s. Absolutely would recommend to anyone!
"
"
Elle fonctionne très bien. La batterie dure longtemps, ce qui est parfait pour l'emporter avec nous. Le nettoyage est fantastique.
"
"
Works great.  I have both an Oral B and this one, both work great
"
"
This one was quite a bit stronger than my last sonic are toothbrush but I got used to it.  Lasts me weeks per charge.
"
"
comes with only one brush so you have to purchase the other to use the other cleaning option.  The price you pay should reflect both brushes in the package.
"
"
Just received the item. Not too sure whether it's because of shipping or manufacturing, but without a toothbrush head, my unit is making an extremely loud noise. Can't really use it without waking everyone up :(
"
"
I wish I had bought a variable speed model as with one speed it is harder to get used to.
"
"
Can buy better ones with better chargers in the pharmacies for about the same money.
"
"
Absolutely loving this toothbrush! It makes my teeth feel super clean! Highly recommend!
"
"
This things lasts forever on a charge. I’m sold. Easy to throw in travel bag. Secure case.
"
"
Replacing an old sonic tooth brush.The new one is just as good.Does a great job of cleaning my teeth.Was recommended by my dentist.
"
"
Since I got this model I feel my teeth are cleaner. I like the gum massage mode after the teeth cleaning and the travel case.
"
"
Love this toothbrush. I haven’t had to recharge yet.
"
"
Travel case is weak. Clasp broke week 1. Other than that the brush is great.
"
"
SUPER QUALATY TANK-YOU
"
"
This is our second round with these, the first units lasted 6 years. Can't survive without this!
"

Good for the price, however the higher end models world work better.
"

I really like this brush
"
"
Use every day. Replaced old unit. Works as expected. All I need b

Love it works great and cleans awesome
"
"
Bought this to replace my old model.  Looks and feels great.  Similar function to the one I bought 3 years ago.
"
"
The brush head is broken and vibrates and shakes about 5 months of use - 1 month after end of support /replacement window. Poor product.
"
"
Best teeth cleaning brush on the market. Long battery life and easy to clean and travel with.
"
"
We bought this to replace our Sonicare Diamond Toothbrush which was about 3 times the price. I can't say I notice a difference in the vibrations/strength, so pretty happy with this one so far!
"
"
I felt the difference this brush makes after Couple of times. I will never go back to a regular tooth brush again! I definitely recommend it ☺️
"
"
was as described and delivery was prompt
"
"
I had one of the first versions of the Soniccare toothbrush that lasted me almost 20 years. Just bought this one last week and I have high hopes it will do the same.
"

Très efficace.  Tel que décrit.  Utile à la maison ou en voyage.

Exactement le bon format pour emporter partout où je vais

Good brush, built in 30 second timer is nice so you know when to move to the next quadrant of your mouth while brushing.

Recommended by my dentist, makes a huge difference.

I have always had issues with sensitive teeth and gums, and on top of that my gums are prone to bleed. Some days I was not able to brush teeth second time in the evening so sore it felt. Considering all that I find Philips Sonicare Protective Clean Gum Health Toothbrush to be perfect for me. It is so safe and gentle to teeth and gums that even my kids could use it.After a week of using it at least twice per day, I had never had even one little bleeding. And for me, it's a miracle.I like a lot the small size of the brush head since I see it as a valuable asset for its maneuverability and accessibility.  I was so impressed with all the mentioned above, that now I keep another brush at my workplace. This is the first brush that I can use several times per day without cuts and scratches.Maybe the most impressive fact was when I woke up in the morning and still could sense that hint of cleanliness in my mouth. You have to try to believe.We have another well-known brand of the toothbrush in the household and my husband can swear by it, but for me it was not that successful experience and I had to stick to the ""old school"" toothbrushes so far.What makes it so safe?1) The sonic vibrations that are dramatically reducing the ""brushing"" activity.2) The ""pressure sensor"", that alerts me when I put too much pressure on the brush head and may harm the gums.3) The bristles sit very tight and they work more like a thick painter brush then a cleaning brush, which again reduces the chance to bruise the gum.4) Built-in two minutes timer with four ""thirty seconds"" divisions.If you are looking for more bells and whistles like three intensity settings for cleaning and three brushing modes (cleaning, whitening and gum care) , take a look at this model or that model.If you are more on the budget side, but still keeping an eye on that type of brushes, 4500 model does the same perfect job.Two words about the design - it is beautiful and thoughtful. Starting from the cylindrical charging pod and ending with the ergonomic body shape of the brush.

I have just recently been introduced to the “sonic” featured toothbrushes from Philips Sonicare collection and WOW, what a difference.I have been using a much cheaper powered toothbrush for years and I always felt satisfied with it but the difference between that one and this one, is a hundred fold. The sonic pulsating that is emitted by this brush took a little getting used to for the first couple of brushings but the result was literally, a cleaner feeling set of teeth.The very first observation that I made was that I was brushing my teeth for a longer period of time, this is thanks to it’s quadrant timer feature. This feature provides a very brief interruption in the power head's vibration, to let you know that it is time to switch to another quadrant of your mouth. Each quadrant segment is set for 30 seconds, providing for the dentist recommended 2 minutes of total brushing time. That, in itself, means that I am brushing better with this appliance because I now realize that I was not brushing anywhere near that long before.This brush is typical of all modern products these days, as it has a few “smart” features. It features. The first of which, is a pressure sensor reading that will advise you with both an audio and visual signal if you are applying too much pressure against your gums and teeth, it will also electronically monitor and then advise you, when it senses that your brush head is approaching and then has reached, it’s effective life span.The battery is a rechargeable Lithium-ion type that promises approx 2 weeks use between charges. A battery light provides different colour indications, blinking and finally audio warnings as the battery nears depletion. This is a NON replaceable battery. When it goes, the brush must be replaced.In the end, it is all about how you feel using this sort of brush and how well it works. I have only using mine for awhile now I am not exaggerating when I say that I wish I had of bought one of these a few years ago. This brush is super comfortable to use, both in the hand and in the mouth. The most telling things for me personally, are the facts that my teeth REALLY do, feel cleaner. It is like thet feeling when they have been polished at the dentist and my gums are reacting very well to this brush head.It should be noted that this series of sonicare brushes have 3 separate styles of brush head. A ""C2"" which is for cleaning, a ""W2"" which is for whitening and a ""G2"" which is for gum care. This model sports the ""G2"" head and admittedly I am not feeling or seeing any changes, good or bad but I am going to chaulk this up to the fact that all is good in the first place and my continuing use of my other Sonicare brush has helped me maintain a state of good oral health.Although these brush heads can be used on a few different models, this particular Sonicare provide the 2 of the possible 3 (found on higher model brushes) programmed time frames that allow for ""gum care"" and ""cleaning care"". The various replacement or ""purposed"" heads come in packs of ""2"" and run about $39 for the pack. This model, as reviewed, comes with the ""G2"" head for gum care . All brush heads are well identified both on the packaging and the neck of the brush head itself.There is no doubt the the price point of this kind of appliance is enough to give anyone pause but I will say this right here and now, if I knew previously, what I have experienced over the last 48 hrs, I would have spent the money without hesitation. The difference in my brushing experience (and the results) feel THAT real. I really can't see myself using any other brush at this point, I absolutely love this series of brushes.This very attractive model also comes with a super handy storage case that holds the main handle and two brush heads. A very nice and convienent addition.

I’ve been using an Oral-B electric toothbrush for years and thought I’d give this Sonicare a try.From a health standpoint the Sonicare toothbrush cleaned every bit as good or perhaps even better than the oral-b.  My gums felt more stimulated by the Sonic Pulsing compared to the oral-b and I found the on/off control button to be easier to push compared to the oral-b.Bottom line … when it comes to cleanliness both Phillips Sonicare and Oral-B do a good job.Pressure Sensor:  I found the pressure sensor on this toothbrush to be less sensitive then I would like.  You have to press fairly hard to get the sensor to kick in and when you do the vibration of the head will change to let you know you’re pressing too hard.Brush Head Reminder:  There is a microchip in the base of the brush head that allows the toothbrush to monitor the brushing time and notify you when it needs to be replaced.  While I like the idea of being notified when the brush head needs to be replaced I don’t like the idea of the microchip.  I prefer heads with bristles that change color when they need replacement.  The microchip feature may prevent you from using other third party brush heads.Travel Case:  The travel case that comes with this brush is great however if you’re going on a long holiday you will have to take the charging base with you as there is not USB charging port on this brush.  My brush usually lasts a week or more so a travel charger isn’t necessary most of the time,…. still an option for USB charging would be nice.Overall I like this toothbrush works well and is easy to use.  The microchip brush head is a little gimmicky and may prevent you from using third party brush heads. The travel case is a great added bonus but there is no way to charge the toothbrush without the base.

 If you're looking to compare to the Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean Toothbrush 4100 White HX6817/01 then it's really more of a preference thing. The only two additions to this model over the 4100 is an extra 'gum-cleaning' mode and the addition of a travel case. In every other way, it's just as good as the earlier model. If you need more bells and whistles (or have disposable income), you can always buy one of the much higher-end Sonicare models, but for those looking to upgrade from a traditional electric or manual toothbrush, this is a great model at a lower price.It has all the amazing design features of the 4100, with the smaller head that can reach easily behind teeth and in smaller mouths and a 2 week charge time and a nice lightweight, white design. The travel case is a nice little extra here, though it's annoying the charger doesn't fit so you'll have to store that separately. I can't really see myself using the 'gum' mode, though if you do want to use it, according to the manual you need a different head. This only comes with the one 'basic' head.When upgrading from an electric or manual, you'll really feel the difference here, but the features are on par with similarly priced Philips models'. It all comes down to which features you want or need in your toothbrush, as you can go more bare-bones than this and also fancier.However, if you choose this one, rest assured you're still going to be getting a great sonic toothbrush that is easy to use and works very well.

Like the title says this is a really nice toothbrush.  I have owned 2 Sonicares in the past which were basically the series 3 (Philips Sonicare Series 3 Plaque & Gum Health Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush with Intensity Control, HX6631/24) and have also owned 2 Oral B’s.  A very basic one which they do not make any more and the high end one I am currently using (Oral-B Pro 7000 SmartSeries Power Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush Designed by Braun (Black) -""Packaging May Vary"").  It is nice to have the comparison for both and I think I will be retiring the Oral B after using this one. Even though the Oral B is great, I find the Sonicare gives my teeth a cleaner feel or a more “dentist-like” experience.  It tickles the gums more than the Oral B so it does take some getting used to, but the easy start feature allows you to grow accustomed to the sensation before it goes to full power.  Don’t forget, it is also about $100 less than the Oral B so for those on a budget, this may be a better option.  If you are really budget conscious and can forego the travel case and extra gum care feature the Sonicare 4100 (4100 series family) is an even more cost efficient option ($99 vs. $59 as of this writing).One of the best features of this toothbrush is the fact that it can operate for two weeks without recharging, making it perfect for travelling.  I think my main complaint about the more expensive Oral B is that it barely lasts me a week before needing a recharge.  I have thoroughly tested this one and believe me, the two week charge claim of the Sonicare is true.  In fact, you could probably squeeze out another day or two if you had to.  I also have to mention the “cleanliness factor” of the brush design in this review as well.  If you have ever used an electric toothbrush you probably experienced the “gunk” buildup in the various crevices of the handle/brush.  This is very noticeable on my Oral B and even on my older Sonicare brushes.  However, this one does not have the same buildup and definitely cleans up more easily than the others.  This is a seldom mentioned feature that should be noted.  This brush also has all the other bells and whistles you  come to expect from an electric:  Two brushing modes (regular and gum care), BrushSync technology that reminds you when to replace your brush head,  a two minute brush time with 30 second reminders to change brushing areas, and pressure sensors to let you know when you're brushing too hard.  All great features that add to the value of this package.Overall, I am very pleased with this toothbrush and while I like the travel case, I am a little disappointed with the inclusion of only one brush head.  I assume they are trying to keep the costs down, but this seems a little “cheap” on their part (the Oral B came with three).  The fact that the travel case doesn’t have room for the charger is also a bit of an annoyance.  I would also like to mention that while the travel case and the added gum feature are nice, I would probably go with the cheaper 4100 to save some money.  For the price vs. features reason I am going to take one star off and give this an overall 4 rating.  Please do not take this as a knock on this toothbrush, because it is excellent.  I just think the company should definitely include a few brush heads and possibly a case which would house the charger to give me a more compelling reason to buy this over the 4100.Recommended!

I never expected features such as the pressure sensor or the timers to be very useful, nor the distinction between clean and gum-care to be noticeable - but having used this toothbrush consistently for some time, I'm now convinced that I was wrong. There are some clear benefits that come with using this brush, and the price seems comparable (if not superior) to other brushes that offer similar qualities.Some additional pros include:- Ergonomic design (it rests comfortably in one's hand)- A battery that lasts up to two weeksIn terms of cons, there are the following observations:- The LED indicators for ""clean"" or ""gum care"" could be positioned or colored differently so that they're easier to tell apart (though they are admittedly quite close to their respective labels)- The timer indications are interruptions to vibration and I would prefer that they were auditory or if there was an option to toggle the feature on and offAlso worth noting is that the toothbrush is heavier than a traditional non-electric one, though I'm sure you'd be hard-pressed to find one that isn't.Overall, I recommend this brush - especially if this is your first foray into electric-brush territory.

I've been using a sonic no-name brand electric toothbrush for the last 4 years. The battery just died so this timely replacement was perfect.First thing I noticed, which I show in the picture attached, is the shape of the brush that it comes with. It is deeply scooped in the middle. When I try to brush a large flat surface of teeth, the entire middle section is not touching my teeth. This adds lots of time to my brushing regimen. I'm not sure what the strategy is to brush the entirety of the front teeth, but it makes it more difficult to make sure I have good contact.The vibration speed is similar to what I used before, so there was no extra tickling. There is also a change in the vibration speed if you press too hard onto your teeth, but you really have to be forcing it hard for that to happen (I've never even accidentally forced that hard)If this is your first sonic tooth brush, allow for a week of giggles until you get used to it.Similar to my other brush, there's a slowdown/buzz sound when you hit 30 seconds (so you know when to change sides), and this happens for two minutes, the  minimum dentist recommended time to brush your teeth.There's an indicator light that shows when it's charging  and another light that shows which brush mode you're in.The gum feature slows down the vibrations allowing for a cleaning/massaging of the gums. If you like to do that, this brush is a good choice.The handle is long enough and slimmer than what i'm used to, and I find it more  comfortable.The verdict? My teeth felt very clean, so it gets the job done. I've taken off a star because of the brush shape requiring more time to get all of my teeth brushed. I would have preferred a small round or rectangular brush, but this definitely still works well.

I had an Oral B toothbrush when I was younger, and it worked ok but it was the rotating brush and quite honestly, I found the design lacking and the brush bulky - as a designer, I opt for both function and design. The matte white finish is quite nice actually (I heard the matte black looks good too which was originally my first choice), and even though it's plastic, it doesn't seem cheap at all - quite opposite it has a luxe feel and look.The design is simple but it's everything you need. I couldn't tell the difference between the clean and gum mode so I found that kind of useless to be honest (am I missing something?).I knocked 1 star because one of the more important features like notifying you when you brush too hard - is done through one of the 2 LED lights and through a slight vibration difference where it sounds like a ghost. It's not super obvious. When you're brushing your bottom teeth, you don't see the warning light. So that is a huge design flaw.It has an internal timer of 2 minutes, divided into 4 (30 secs) for each section of your mouth, I find it quite helpful. It doesn't quite beep like they said it does, the vibration just does a higher pitch sound but it's noticeable, after you use it 1-2 times you understand what that is.It feels like I come out of the dentist's after every use, I had a cheap ""sonic"" toothbrush from the pharmacy but wowie, you get what you paid for. I have 2 other friends that have a sonic care philips as well and we all got excited to talk about it, because you know, that's how adults have fun. To have 3 adults actually excited about their toothbrush? I'd say that's pretty much all the info you need lol.UPDATE Dec 2ndKnocking off another star for 2 reasons.It is way too easy to get this thing dirty, I had this toothbrush without a case (to save space) in a carry on for a fe hours and there were dye transfer issues and is impossible to clean. I don't even understand how or what dyed it, I think a bag, but nothing was wet. I've tried everything to clean it, it's impossible.The ""premium"" case also doesn't work well. The clasp already won't click into place after using it a handful of times, never in crazy conditions, it goes in a bag that's not thrown around. the case is also unnecessarily too big and bulky hence why last time I didn't bring it.UPDATE Dec 3rdcustomer service is excellent. i did a chat with them and essentially they are sending me a brand new handle, I guess that issue falls under warranty. I'm even getting an upgraded model due to them not having any extras of my current model. I also asked about the travel case and they are sending me a new one as a ""one time exception"".I highly suggest you use the case then because of this issue, although I wish this wasn't an issue so if I wanted to travel light I didn't need to bring the case with me. When you're traveling minimally solo, lugging a giant case just for a toothbrush is not what you want to be doing.

Me likes.I’ve used electric toothbrushes for a long time (at least 25 years) but they have all been of the variety where the brush cycles backwards and forwards. I find that the action here does a far better job of cleaning and getting between the teeth, especially the molars which can be a bugger to get at. Plaque seems to be removed better/faster with the “sonic” action Philips brushes utilize.The charger is nice and small, and as its wireless the whole toothbrush can be submerged when rinsing without worrying about water ingress shorting things out. This makes cleaning very easy, a few extra seconds at the end of the process to rinse and it’s done. The charger does take a few hours to provide a full charge when the battery is dead but as this is an over night process for us it makes no difference.The included shell for holding everything in one place makes traveling easy. There is one brush head included, although the travel case has room for two (come on guys it would break the bank to include at least two), which is removed from the body and then snapped in place. This is a plain plastic shell, easy to clean as well, just rinse under warm water. There's no room for the charger in the case nor is there any charging capability built into it like some brands are offering. I found that I can easily get a weeks worth of brushing on one charge, twice daily as the dentist suggests.To me there is very little difference in the action between the two modes offered on the model, cleaning and gum care. To switch between them you depress the mode button before powering it up. A LED lights up showing which mode has been selected.Like most electric brushes today, Philips offers a buzz indicator every thirty seconds to ensure you spend enough and not too much time in each quarter and then it auto shuts off at 2 minutes so that you don’t overdo things.

After using an Oral B rechargeable toothbrush for years, I got my first Sonicare toothbrush about 2-3 years ago and I was impressed by how much cleaner my teeth felt compared to both manual toothbrushing and my Oral B. I got the cheapest, basic model (Essence +) and I honestly don’t think there’s much of a difference performance-wise between the Essence + and this model (ProtectiveClean 4500). The 4500 is taller, slimmer and a cool matte black color and it has two cleaning modes rather than one and but in the end, it cleans just as well, no better and no worse.I do like that this model comes with an EasyStart mode for those new to rechargeable brushes. For the first fourteen times you brush with this, the power starts off low and gradually increases to the regular strength (31,000 brush strokes per minute). This is to ease you into non-manual toothbrushing.There’s also a Quadpacer which helps you to devote 30 seconds to each section of your mouth. After thrity seconds, the brush buzzes differently to remind you to move on to the next area. This isn’t something I really pay attention to as I just take as much time as I deem necessary for each area.== CLEANING MODES ==CLEAN MODE – Lasts 2 minutes (recommended to be used with the Sonicare C2 Optimal Plaque Control brush head)GUM CARE – Lasts 3 minutes (recommended to be used with the Sonicare G2 Optimal Gum Care brush head)That’s it. That’s the difference between the two modes. The Gum Care mode just lasts one minute longer and I guess you should switch from the regular brush head to the gum care one.== BRUSHSYNC TECHNOLOGY – REPLACEMENT REMINDER FEATURE ==Another difference between the basic Sonicare toothbrush and this 4500 model is the brush head replacement reminder feature. The toothbrush tracks the wear of your smart brush head by syncing with the microchip in it. This BrushSync technology is kind of unnecessary to me as I can tell for myself when I need to replace my toothbrush heads. I don’t want to have to pay a bit more for some brush head that has a microchip in it! I never had a replacement reminder for my Oral B brush heads nor for my regular manual toothbrush as it’s pretty obvious when they’re too worn out.== PRESSURE SENSOR ==This is a feature I like although I rarely press hard enough to activate the alert. It’s good for those adjusting to using a rechargeable toothbrush or for those who already have problems due to brushing too hard. Using too much pressure when brushing your teeth can damage your enamel and cause receding gums so always be gentle when brushing. If you do use a heavy hand when brushing your teeth with the 4500, it will change vibration and you’ll notice right away so you can lay off a bit. Everytime the brush starts vibrating strangely, lessen up the pressure. Eventually, it trains you to be more gentle. You can always turn off this feature if you’d like.PROS+ Slimmer and taller than basic model+ Gives dentist-clean feeling to my teeth and gums+ Includes travel case and brush cap+ Pressure sensor technology alerts you when you’re pressing too hard (bad for your enamel and gum health!)+ EasyStart, Pressure Sensor and Brush Replacement Reminder features can all be deactivated if desiredCONS- More $$$ than basic model without many added features- Two different modes (Clean & Gum Care) are gimmicky – would have preferred variable speeds insteadI would personally recommend the cheaper Essence + model as it is about $60 cheaper and the few extra features on the 4500 just aren’t worth the extra cost to me. If the 4500 had two different speed/power levels rather than the cleaning modes, that would be a different story. I would really like if this one had a lower power/speed mode for areas where I have to brush extra gently as I have receding gums in some areas so I end up having to swap for a manual toothbrush for those areas.

What can I be said about this toothbrush that hasn't been said about every other toothbrush in the last 5 years?  Does it work? Absolutely it does, the sonicare movement is quite good at plaque removal and gum health where as a rotating head would be better for removing debris between teeth.  It's hard to get excited about these anymore since they all perform very well and it's hard to introduce any game changing technologies to a toothbrush that hasn't been around for a few years already. That being said, this is a very sleek and well performing toothbrush, I just wouldn't get sucked up into the hype from the marketing. The toothbrush is comfortable to operate and offers two modes and also a safety mechanism that detects if you are applying too much force to your teeth / gums and will automatically pause operations. Button layout is simple and easy to navigate with out looking. Charge time is average and run time is sufficient.Replacement heads are a bit pricey but changes aren't required that often so it's not that bad.I think for the ultimate cleaning, one should treat this unit as an accessory in addition to a rotating head brush and a water pick. It does leave your teeth looking clean but for a really thorough cleaning; I feel like it can't achieve the results alone.

Fantastic brush, though a bit pricey if you're just looking for an electric brush.Pros:+ high quality brush, certainly doesn't feel cheap like the typical $20-30 brush+ the pressure sensor is great, a good reminder if you tend to push too hard+ the whole brush is waterproof, nice not to worry about washing the brush well+ long brush heads are nice to reach to the back of my molars, always seems to be a spot that doesn't get the attention it needs but the skinny long brush head does the trickNeutral:~ BrushSync is interesting, though I'd love to see a study of using 'expired' brush heads as I'm thoroughly convinced you can just keep using the same brush head for a LONG time before it's not cleaning as effectively; I clean mine very well and dry it after use and they last a very long time before they start to break down~ if you haven't used this type of sonic brush before you may find it extraordinarily ticklish but it seems to wear off after a week of use or so~ over the 4100 model, this comes with a better dedicated gum brush, but I think it's more gimmicky than anything~ also comes with a carrying case, this is actually a nice thing to have to keep your brush clean, but the case is kinda cheapCons:- 'maintenance' of replacing heads every so often becomes very expensive and they have tried to make the brush heads proprietary and scare you from buying knockoffs, I haven't bought knockoffs for this (yet) but it's a bit more intimidating when they have this BrushSync feature and makes me feel like I HAVE to buy the manufacturer OEM brand stuffThis does a great job at getting my teeth squeaky clean. It's a tad on the pricey side, I think the pressure sensor is slightly a gimmick, just be gentle on your teeth. Also the BrushSync is slightly gimmicky, I think you could find a brush for $20-40 cheaper that works just as well with no gimmicks.

I'll cut straight to the point: this is a great toothbrush! I was skeptical (for no apparent reason) whenever I would see these on the shelves at my local big box store. I have a lot of other Philips product in my house that I have been impressed with, so I should have expected this toothbrush would be no different!It seems like all it does is vibrates really, really fast, but unlike other toothbrushes I've used that function this way (as opposed to driving a rotating brush head), this one actually cleans my teeth really well. If I brush before bed, I wake up and my teeth still feel clean. This is often not the case with other brushes I've used.There are no mode settings on this brush, just an on/off switch and a switch to toggle the gums care program on or off. If you turn the gum care on, once it kicks in the brush then vibrates a little differently than usual, more roughly or slower or something. That's it. The brush also does a very brief pause/noise whenever it's time to switch quadrant focus in your mouth. That is a feature that I really enjoyed on my last Braun brush, and the Philips does it even better.The G2 brush heads look pricey, but at least one is included with this kit. They are much more narrow than any other toothbrush I've tried as an adult, and you notice how slim it is every time you brush. It doesn't seem to impact the cleaning, and makes me think that this would be an excellent brush for children. I'm considering getting my son one, in fact.The other items included in the kit are a travel case with enough space for the handle and two brush heads, and a sit-on charger. That's all.I had been using a Braun electric toothbrush for a while now, and before that, an assortment of other brand cheapo electric toothbrushes. The Braun was quite good, but I never cared for the Bluetooth functionality and the cleaning ability just doesn't seem as strong as this Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean does. It has become my new primary brush, and is likely to stay that way.

The vibrations in the Gum Mode are just as strong as in the Clean Mode. The Gum Mode provides an extra 60 seconds of cleaning over the Clean Mode.  I find this Model 4500 offers the strongest of all the Sonicare I’ve tried through the past decade. It appears this Model 4500 is an ultrasonic rather than  a sonic model.The too much pressure sensor is a nice feature.  Great electric sonic toothbrush so far!

There are three types of electric toothbrushes, Rotating head, sonic and ultrasonic. This brush is a sonic brush. Each brush has its strength and weakness. A rotary head is best at removing food and debris while an ultrasonic brush is best at plaque removal/prevention. A sonic brush does a good job at both and provides a solution in the middle.This Philips sonic toothbrush made the transition from a rotary head very easy, The bush has a 14day quick start program that slowly increases the speed to full and to allow you to get adjusted to the vibrating feeling.The toothbrush also provides a unique 30-second beep and automatically shuts off after 2 minutes. The 30-second beep is to tell you to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. The auto-off helps to protect you from over brushing something that most who brush are doing.Philips also offers 3 different heads, while I can’t speak to the whitening head, the gum care head has softer bristles while the regular clean seems to be a regular strength head. This kit comes with the gum care brush by default. This version comes with the gum care mode ( soft bristle head ) and a case as well. Other than those two features the version 4100 is the same. I was not able to notice much difference in the settings on the brush nor did the instructions provide much guidance. I would decide between the two based on if you need the travel case or not or prefer a soft bristle brush.Overall I am quite pleased with the sonic brush, it has reduced my gum inflammation and the quadrant feature ensures that I am both getting every area while not over brushing. I would recommend both versions of the brush.

I've been using an Oral B electric brush for the past year or so and have been reasonably satisfied with it's performance until trying this Sonicare Brush from Philips. This brush rocks! It's so much more suited to my needs than Oral B.This brush has two cleaning settings, one for teeth and one for him care. That's especially important to me since I have receeding gums. I found my old brush annoyed my gums a lot.I love that this brush signals me when I'm applying too much pressure because that's the reason I have him problems to begin with; brushing to aggressively.This brush in white, looks really classy and feels so much more luxurious than my old one.One major issue I had with my old brush is that my tounge or inside cheek would sometimes get caught in the little space between the head of the brush and the part that oscilates. This brush is impossible to have that happen with since the connection isn't in the part that goes in my mouth and it doesn't oscillate, just vibrate.Overall, I found it did a much better job on my teeth than Oral B did. I highly recommend this brush for anyone who has similar issues.

I am a bit intimidated by electric toothbrushes as I find them difficult to ""direct"".  However, this one is compact enough that I could direct it without any trouble.It works extremely well on most of my teeth, but I have a sensitive area and this toothbrush made it painful to brush in this area. So I prefer my regular handheld brush for that area.However, this electric toothbrush does a great job of cleaning my teeth (minus the sensitive area) very well.  The brush head can get to places that I don't seem to be able to reach with a regular brush and I always feel as though the tooth by my gum line is much cleaner as I can use the ""gum"" feature which i sort of alternate with the ""clean"" function.I have receding gum lines so it is important that I clean the area between my gums and the tooth well and this Philips does an excellent job.I also love how I can easily reach the back teeth that are always more of a challenge.It is compact on my tiny bathroom counter and it comes with a carry case (which I have not had to use) but I can see how it would be useful for travelling.Nice and sturdy (i have dropped it twice in the sink and every piece was intact).Good electric toothbrush.

I have tried a few different electric toothbrushes, however this is my first Sonicare experience. The first moments using this toothbrush were a little odd, as it was definitely not something that I was used to. Instead of rotating a brush head like your typical electric brush, this vibrates the brush head while you move it through your mouth.I was very impressed with the little pause to remind you to switch quadrants of your mouth to ensure that you put the same amount of time into every area of your mouth. It is advised that you brush for two minutes, so you can easily get this done with this brush. The included carrying case is definitely really nice and will be a lot better than tossing my tooth brush in a Zploc like I've done before.The one issue I have with this product is the cost of the BrushSync brush heads. At almost $15 each, there is very little value to be had.

Being a vine voice I always try to find something different to comment on than other reviewers. This is a product that has been so completely reviewed by a few top rated reviewers that I'm suggesting you read what they have to say. I'm referring specifically  to  the reviews by Chris Hogan, top 100 reviewer and 4a94e, top 500 reviewer. Their coverage on this Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean Toothbrush  explains all that is needed to know about the product.On a personal note , I have been struggling with dental issues for several years and believe that over time, this electric toothbrush will help significantly improve my dental health.I am 1200% recommending this product.

This is only the second electric toothbrush I have ever used. My other one is much more expensive than this one. However, I am very impressed with this Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean Toothbrush 4500 Black HX6820/60. My teeth feel like I just came from the dentist every time I brush. Before I always felt like I was missing spots or that I didn't even brush. This toothbrush will allow you to brush every area for the right amount of time so that you do not miss anywhere. It has a 2-minute timer with a 30-second interval notification. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get an electric toothbrush and don't to break the bank.

This is a fantastic toothbrush.  This unit replaced an oral-b one I have been using for about a year.  I could immediately tell this brush does a better job than the oral-b.  Not only do the bristles move much faster,  but the movement is more effective. While it cleans it foams the toothpaste and pushes it between teeth,  enhancing its cleaning ability.  And it feels great in the hand,  its a very high quality build. The battery lasts a long time,  at least one week at two brushes per day.  Overall I really like the sonicare.

I bought 4 of this brand all different models. Mine was around $150 and is about 1.5 years old and the pin is now loose but it still works. My daughter's doesn't work any more.

Great toothbrush. Cleans well. I like the gum care feature. It really helps keep gums healthy.There's one button to turn it on/off and another button to switch between the normal cleaning and gum care modes. Gum care is a gentler vibration than normal cleaning mode to keep those gums nice and pink.
"
"
Because of the poor design the toothbrush plastic handle keeps hitting my teeth when I turn it in my mouth and it vibrates against my teeth which is very annoying.  I never had this problem with an oral b because of the better design.  I only use it now for the tongue cleaner.  Total waste of money.

I preface this review to say that i have been a long time lover of the oral-b BASIC brush.  I have tried more modern electric brushes here and there made by other brands and I always came back to simple basic oral-b brushes because had found no additional benefit from others.I am going to say that I've finally found a brush system that surpasses the oral-b brush.  This philips soniccare offers a significantly new brushing experience than any other brush i've used.  And here is why:My night time regiment is as follows,1) floss (remove major food gunk)2) brush with oral-b with colgate prevident3) use a rubber dental pic to rub gum line to get the gunk that the brush could not4) listerineAt step 3, when i use the rubber dental pick, i usually find a decent amount of gunk removed despite the fairly thorough brushing from the oral-b.I've used the philips soniccare for a week now to test fully.  At step 3, I HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS gunk build-up at the gumline.  I almost dont need to use the dental  rubber pick anymore.This is clear evidence to me, that this is the first electric brush i have used that is significantly better than oral-b and other brand electronic brushes.compared to any other brushes i've used, the philip soniccare has an extremely high frequency of vibrations.  It is so powerful and fast that it really tickles your lips.  You'll eventually get used to it but the first few brushes you really feel tickled.  The brush that comes with this unit is medium soft which is a good thing because you really do not want a hard brush -- that would tear your gums apart.  great thing is, that it will hold back when it senses excessive pressure --- kind of a good thing for those with a lead  grip.the charge has lasted a whole week so far and will probably go for another week --- i'll write back to check in on how long this lasted me.This 4500 model is a gum care model that comes with a dedicated gum brush head... Differs in shape. The unit has a separate mode button for gum brushing mode. Quite frankly I'm not really convinced .... It honestly just feels gimmicky.  Changes the duration cycle of the warnings in this mode.  If you were to buy into the soniccare system I think you're better off with a 4100 model.  Save your money.Additional  gimmicky features are a timed ""quadrant"" buzz which informs you that youre done brushing a certain quadrant and you should switch to another quadrant of your teeth (~30secs), and a warning to buy a new brush head.  Frankly, those are features i dont need.  I know how long i should brush and when its time to swap heads.I REALLY like the ergonomics of the brush handle because it is LONG.  That lets you reach in there to the back and get a good handle on angles.  I really like the satin rubber feel that washes toothpaste off easily.  The brush itself comes off easy with a tug so you can thoroughly wash the brush after use.So seriously if you havent tried this brush, its time to upgrade. And as I mentioned I think the 4100 is a better buy than this 4500.
"
"
Not worth the money for the extra features. However, read the manual on how to turn features on or off, and how the brush timer works. It has quite a few options which is cool.The extra gum mode isn't a slower mode per say. It's a different brush pattern/amount of time. With that being said the 4100 is cheaper but has the same horsepower, minus the extra mode.I sort of wish the base used a usb cable for charging to make travel easier with other battery gadgets we carry.Otherwise, it is easily the best toothbrush I've used. Takes a few tries to get used to it. Once you got it, bam feels dentist visit clean. Costco has the best deal for heads

The style and look is the same as the older model however the battery doesn't even last the full 2 minutes it is supposed to for brushing. After about a minute, it does this funny sound and the brush mechanism seems to jitter rather than brush as it does when it starts and is fully charged. Very disappointing to us. We usually use appliances for as long as we possibly can, and the previous model had lasted years. So this was a marked decrease in quality from the first time we used it. However, we still prefer it to hand brushing.
"
"
I had the previous version for many years but they stopped making the tips for that model. So I bought this one instead. The tips are better anyways. Nice solid casing for traveling. Don't bother going for a more expansive model. In the end, they are all the same. You don't need all the gadgets and you certainly don't need a phone app to monitor where and how long you brushed you teeth. There are gimmicks that are just going to cost you more for nothing. I can't use a regular toothbrush anymore. I need my electric one.
"
"
Love this toothbrush! Sonicare is the best brand I've found, I could never go back to other electric toothbrush brands after this. My teeth feel so clean all the time. It comes with a case, and the battery life is amazing (I've gone up to 3 months before I had to charge it). My last Sonicare lasted me almost 10 years and this one seems to be just as good quality, making the price absolutely worth it.
"
"
I had a version of this toothbrush before and I bought this to replace it. It works well and it is nice to have the travel case so I can take it when I go away. The only thing that would give it 5 Star is I think for the cost it should also come with one spare replacement head.
"
"
Recommend by my dentist to improve my gum problem.Nicely build. Good battery duration.  Replacement head is expensive.It seems starting to working after a few weeks used.Has to see what my dentist will say at my next visit.
"
"
Great toothbrush, cleans deep and it's gentle with your gums.Comes with a handy travel case, only one head added in the package.Waterproof and charging station is enclosed as well (wireless charging).Let's see how long it lasts, so far it has 5 stars.
"

En ce qui concerne la batterie, c'est avec le temps, qu'on peut évaluer cet aspect.  Pour les têtes de rechange universelles., il y a moins de choix, que pour les Brosse Oral B.
"
"
Awesome brush and love how clean my teeth feel! Not worth buying the more expensive Diamond one.
"
"
This thing is amazing! Best electric toothbrush I’ve had to date. Now, only if I could find the brush head that came with it to buy more of those. Feel like that was better than the replacements found in stores.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush, it cleans really well and after using it for the last 2 weeks notice a difference in my gums (less bleeding when flossing). Highly recommended
"
"
Excellent electronic toothbrush. I have sensitive gums and they work well to keep my teeth clean without hurting my gums.
"

La batterie dure vraiment plus longtemps que dans les précédents model, nettoie bien les dents

You can never go wrong with Phillips !... Great product and price

This is a nice toothbrush and fits the no name tooth brush heads too.

Works great however be careful on purchasing non Phillips replacement heads.

This is a simple pretty no frills electric toothbrush, and is priced accordingly at $70.67 (at the time of this review).It's a little funny that it's black but comes with a white toothbrush attachment, but is obviously not a problem at all.Like most electric toothbrushes, this one has a built-in timer that will briefly vibrate differently to indicate that it's time to move on to another quarter section of your mouth.It also has pressure sensors, that will again vibrate differently to let you know you're pressing to hard, although I have never found this to be an issue. (I guess I never apply too much pressure.)I like that it has a great lithium ion battery in it and with regular use will hold a charge for XXX.(It's nice that I don't have to leave the charging base out cluttering up my bathroom counter.It does come precharged but the instructions say after the first use to charge it for 24 hours. After use the colour of the LED changes to indicate the battery life status. The battery lasts about two weeks, which is actually pretty good for an electric toothbrush. (It has a lithium ion battery, which is pretty standard these days.)Here's my only issue with this toothbrush.  I don't need a lot of extras on an electric toothbrush. (See my comments below about the ""Clean"" & ""Gum Care"" settings.) However I do prefer to have a toothbrush that allows you to adjust the intensity or speed. This unit only has one speed. High. But if you're just starting off with one of these you want one that gives you a slower, less intense option to get used to it. And even if you've used these for years, some days you just don't want the vibration to be quite to ""loud"". LolIt does come with EasyStart, which is a feature that gently increases the power of the first 14 brushings to help you get used to it. But at full power I simply find it too strong.It also has a Clean Mode, which is a 2 minute bode to be used with the supplied C2 Optimal Plaque Control brush head.The ""Gum Care"" mode, is a 3 minute mode, to be used with a G2 Optimal Gum Care brush head. (Not included.)So two things here.- You might want to keep looking for a different toothbrush that allows different speeds, especially if you've never used one before. (I REALLY don't like that this is only High Speed. If you already know that won't bother you, then there really is nothing wrong with this unit.)- And if you only have a limited budget for your dental care, or limited plug and counter space in your bathroom, I'd personally get a water flosser over an electric toothbrush any day. Those things are great! And they really do get way more crud out of your teeth and gums than a regular or electric toothbrush can.  (If I could only have one item, it would definitely be a water flosser over an electric toothbrush.)

I've used electric toothbrushes for years and I've never thought about going back to a regular toothbrush. The electric toothbrush has a ton of advantages, most of which has to do with an even and consistent brushing motion to remove plaque build up. For as long as I can remember, electric toothbrushes all worked the same way via an oscillating motion of the head. The Philips Sonicare toothbrush uses sonic technology to clean your teeth. Sonic technology has been used for years to clean everything from surgical tools to firearms and machine parts. The vibrations loosen and remove dirt from the surfaces of different materials. When I first heard about the toothbrush using this technology, I was very excited. However, when I started to use it, I could never get used to the constant vibrating on the teeth. Philips knows that the sonic vibrations takes time to get used to, and they've programmed the toothbrush to ramp up in power over time for you to get used to it (14 cleanings before you reach full power). Over this ramp up period, I was never able to get used to it, it just felt like a drill in my skill and it went down to the bone. It was not pleasant at all.That said, I do like how it beeps/vibrates every 30 seconds to remind you to switch quadrants in your mouth and then it automatically shuts off after 2 minutes (3 min for gum care mode). I also like how the batter will last up to 2 weeks of cleaning without having to be recharged. You also get a handy travel case to keep your brush safe when you travel.I think it's a great brush and it's effective, as long as you can get used to the sonic vibrations. Something I was never able to get used to.

I had been a die hard oral b fan for years. I went through 3 of their $30 electric tooth brushes with the head that did circles, and brushed up and down. I was perfectly happy with that tooth brush until I used this one! Now I'll never go back! My smile is also noticeably whiter after a week and a half of using this brush!This Phillip's tooth brush is hands down the best brush I've ever used. My teeth have never felt cleaner! I get that ""fresh from the dentist"" feeling every single day! My teeth now stay smooth and clean far longer than they did with my old brush.Here's what I love about this thing.1. The carrying case is awesome. I recently went away for a wedding, and the case was perfect! The brissles stayed perfectly in tact!2. The battery lasts forever! I've been using it for a week and a half and the battery light is still green!3. The 30 second indicator for raging the 4 sections of your mouth works amazing! I'm brushing a lot more evenly now!What I slightly dislike is that the head is smaller. Maybe that's just because I'm used to the big oral b head, but obviously this size is doing a perfect job, so I really can't complain.

 MY “BRUSHING” HISTORYMy last three toothbrushes have been Oral-B rotary powered units. When I switched from manual to the cheap powered brush, my dentist noticed and asked me if I switched. I also tried an ultrasonic brush but returned it after not liking it. I always thought that I much preferred rotary brushes.WHAT’S INCLUDEDThe 4500 handle comes with a single brush head, a travel case (which can hold up to two heads firmly, but doesn’t hold the handle in place), and an inductive charging stand.USABILITYOnce the brush head is on, a single button turns on the unit. There is a second button that can be used to cycle between brushing modes (clean or gums). When the unit is turned off, it remembers the last brushing mode and turns back on in the same mode. If you press too hard on your teeth/gums, the unit notifies you. It also alerts you in 30 second intervals to remind you to move to the next quadrant. The brush head is comfortable to hold, and is sized such that it should fit comfortably into anyone’s hand.PHILIPS BRUSHSYNC “SMART” BRUSH HEADSThe brush heads “talk” to the handle. Apparently this communication allows the handle to run at the appropriate frequency based on brush type. It can also allow the brush to notify the handle when it needs replacement. I hate the idea of this, but from what I’ve read online, a worn head won’t disable the toothbrush.QUALITY OF CLEANMy teeth feel squeaky clean after using this brush. Very good, but probably about the same as my previous rotary brush. I don’t see a need for “gums” mode, and always just use the standard “clean” mode.BATTERY LIFEThe battery life of this unit is excellent. I’ve been using the brush for about 2 weeks now and haven’t had to recharge (I did charge it fully before my first use).PROS & CONSThe good:+ Provides an excellent clean+ Excellent good battery life+ Remembers last brush mode, so no scrolling through modes requiredThe bad:- Travel case requires removing brush and can’t hold charger, and doesn’t hold handle tightly- I found the included brush smaller and softer than I preferOVERALLThis is a solid power toothbrush at a good price, though the 4100 (appears to be identical but without the gum mode) may be the best value.

The first few times I used this brush it was so ticklish I almost couldn't continue using it but within a few days I got used to it and then it was fine.I love that the brush lasts more than a week on a full charge. I also like the built in timer indicator that stops me at 2 minutes of brushing. I realized that I have over brushing my whole life so this was a good feature to have. The official brush head replacements are really pricey, almost $40 for a pack of 2. There is an indicator light on the handle that goes off when the brush head needs to be replaced but the brush continues to function normally if you ignore this light. This brush is definitely a long-term investment. The handle is much longer than a manual brush and takes some getting used to as well if you're coming from a manual brushing experience.Aside from that, I did like the overall performance of this brush. My mouth feels cleaner  and I like that I am not overbrushing anymore.

I've had the opportunity to use philips full range of sonicate tooth brushes. The reality is that between their top and lowest end products, there actually isn't much of a difference. At it's core, the handle pushes out about the same amount of power, and the heads are all interchangeable. The main difference between the low and high end models is the inclusion of a case, and different brushing modes.For this particular model, there's a nice travel case included as well as the additional ""Gum"" brushing mode. The different brushing modes, in all honesty, don't add much to the actual brushing experience. They alternate the frequency and strength of the vibrations to optimize it for protection/cleaning of gums, but I've found the actual benefit of these different brush modes to be quite dubious at best. So what does this leave you with? When you ignore these additional brushing modes, the core brushing experience is the same throughout the whole sonicare line, which is to say it's quite good.The sonicare line as a whole employs incredibly fast (""sonic"") vibrations which help to clear out dirt between and on your teeth with minimal brushing effort. This means less pressure on your teeth needed to achieve the same cleaning effect, and an overall better cleaning. The long handle and brush heads make it easy to get into tough nooks and crannies in the back of the mouth, as well as brushing behind your teeth as well, so you get good coverage. I appreciate the new pressure sensors that come standard on all sonicare models which warns you if you're pushing too hard in real time. In addition, the 4 quadrant timer has become standard in all models, pushing your brushing briefly every 30 seconds to tell you to move onto another area in the mouth. I don't necessarily use it to track my teeth quadrants, but it's helpful as a built in timer to make sure I get my 2 minutes in every time I brush.So if the core sonicare experience is great and consistent across the whole line, from low to high end, then what will be the deciding factor for which model to go with? Really it's a matter of cost and the physical accessories you get. Between this and the lowest end model, the only real difference is the travel case - you get the same charger and that same core experience (with the addition of the gum brushing mode which as mentioned before, really doesn't make a difference). The question really then is, how much is the travel case worth to you, and is it worth whatever price difference you may find between this model and the next model down. Personally I quite like having a travel case with my electric tooth brush. It makes packing for trips that much easier. The case included with this is made of plastic, and not super nice, but it'll get the job done and is fitted perfectly for the tooth brush. So if you can get this particular for not much more than the model down, the case could be a worthwhile addition. Otherwise, I'd recommend simply going with one of the lower end sonicare brushes.

I love this toothbrush. I had previously been using an Oral B Pro 3000. At my most recent dental checkup, I was told I brush too hard, so when I saw that the Sonicare warns when you to lighten up, I had to try it.Aesthetically, it's very pleasing. Sleek, white minimal design. Soft velvety feel to the touch.The head comes with a plastic cap to keep it protected if left on your counter. The charger is small and unobtrusive, which is great because we don't have a permanent-on outlet in our bathroom and have to charge in our bedroom.My model has 2 modes - Clean, and Gum. The difference is 1 minute of brushing time. Clean mode pulses in 30 second intervals until you've reached 2 minutes then it reminds you to stop. Gum mode pulses in 30 seconds intervals until 2 minutes, then allows for an additional minute of gum massage before reminding you to stop at 3 minutes.The head has a magnetic plate with sensors that detect how much pressure is being applied. This works in two ways: 1, it lets you know you're brushing too hard by pulsing until you stop, and 2. It tells you when the best time to replace the head is by detecting how hard you've brushed and for how long. As someone who's known for using a brush head until it's flat, it's great I'll now have a visual reminder to smarten me up. The vibration intensity is strong. It tickles my nose. But so did my Clarisonic Mia 2 when I first got it, and now I hardly notice.
"
"
I'm a bit of a health nut and take care to keep my teeth in good shape, brushing, flossing, rinsing, and going to my dentist at least twice a year for cleanings and checkups.To that end, I've tried many, many manual and electric brushes. My regular brush is an Oral-B electric that oscillates, though I have tried ultrasonic-type brushes before.I'll keep this review short: great cleaning action, controls are just the right level of simple (you do not need 12-modes - the 2 built in are fine).A concern: ""coded"" brush heads, with a feature called ""BrushSync"". (see attached photo)The heads have a microchip in them to ostensibly to let the brush base notify you when the head is due for replacement. The notification feature can even be disabled with a bit of a ""Konami code"" (explained in the manual, along with other codes). My biggest concern is will this brush work with 3rd party heads? That would put it in the ""inkjet model"" territory like printers that won't let you use ink tanks from anyone but the manufacturer. I won't deduct a star for this (yet) but if I try a 3rd party head and the brush refuses to use it, mark my words, this brush is getting no stars.Another gripe: while a nice travel case is included, there's no USB charging option. There are other Philips Sonicare models with a portable USB charger so you can power-up on extended trips without taking the charging base. I feel this should be standard on ALL small appliances now (toothbrushes, portable shavers etc) as they all use the same lithium cells that can be charged with very cheap, off-the-shelf circuits.Still, this brush does a more than adequate job of cleaning, leaving my teeth (especially the spaces between them, and my gum line) squeaky clean. All the usual features are built in like ""brushing too hard"", and ""quadrant done"" indicators using vibration patterns.I feel like this brush should be priced about 30-50% less than it is, given it's not BlueTooth, doesn't have a USB charge option, and is competing with very competent and competitively priced Oral-B oscillating brushes with much lower price tags. As such, I'm knocking off one star.

About 8 years ago I picked up a Philips Sonic Care for my wife. It has held up well. Still maintains a great charge, and other than some wear on the back of the handle looks great. This second-generation model is what I have picked up for my own use finally. Overall, I am very happy with it. My dentist has been suggesting one of these electric toothbrushes for years now. I should have picked one up earlier. I have been blessed and at nearly 50 have only had 1 cavity and a chipped tooth. I do brush often, and usually brush in the shower, one of the reasons I avoided an electric. But after using this for the last few days, even just using it in the morning and before bed I have noticed a difference. One of the things I love is that the chargers are interchangeable. This new one charges on an 8 year old base, and the 8 year old tooth brush charges on the new base, an excellent feature for travel. And speaking of travel, this brush comes with a travel case that will hold the device and 2 separate brushes. Another excellent feature for travel. I am very thankful to now have this and take my oral hygiene to the next level. The only dray back was learning to brush with my mouth closed so I do not get spray all over the place. Love this and look forward to years of use.

I purchased a higher end Sonicare for myself awhile back and I've been completely satisfied with it... and despite the lower price, I have to say that in my daily use, this has been functionally the same in many regards.The cleaning performance is every bit as powerful it's more expensive siblings and personally, the modes this lacks are not really something I used - it's always max power all the way for me. My general issue is that these use proprietary stand chargers that are a pain to bring on vacation and I find the USB travel cases to the way of the future.Compared to the 4100 that I also tried out this week, the only real difference is the gum care mode which changes up the time and you're supposed to plug in a different brush head. Maybe you'll do it... but if you're like me, it's too much hassle. Personally, I find it gimmicky but maybe it's something that you don't mind doing.Outside of niceties like a beautiful glass charging glass and a USB charging case, this is a great brush that is effectively the same as the high end models and I'd definitely be satisfied if I purchased this one.

Terrific brushing experience. The oscillating action works much better than the rotating ones for removing plaque and making my teeth feel smooth. The design in light and easy to hold with lots of power and not much bulkiness in the brushing head. All this makes it easy to reach any part of the mouth without hitting your gums. The solid head deign prevents water from leaking into the brush head and making it's way into the motor (which has killed at-least 2 of my other brushes). I find the pressure sensor to be rather useless as it never went off for me while brushing and the gum mode also seems to make no difference in brushing force. The brush also buzzes ever 30 second to indicate that you should move to another part of the mouth which is rather hard to follow, however this feature can be turned off. At the start the brushing intensity is lower and goes up as you use it more, which is meant to let people get used to the force. In the case you are simply replacing another Philips brush with this one, this feature can also be turned off. All in all I find this to be a great and budget friendly option for keeping your teeth shiny.

I've been using Sonicare toothbrushes for about 8 years and have found them to be vastly superior to other electric toothbrushes.That said, I still haven't figured out what difference any of the additional settings make.  This particular one is pretty basic, yet it works as well as the more advanced ones for two-to-three times the price.I'm not sold on the ""connected"" brush idea that somehow helps the handle tell you when the brush needs changing (hence the reduced one star) -- this feels like it will lead to the old ink/toner cartridge situation where there's still plenty of toner, but you've somehow reached an arbitrary limit so it's shutting down.I haven't used this unit long enough to say how it reacts to ""over"" using a brush head... but just the idea that it will have that electronically concerns me and appears to be a case of creeping featuritits.Long story short: it's a good brush, like all other Sonicare, and a good starting point down the electric toothbrush journey.

I have an Oral-B electric toothbrush that I have used for years.  In comparison, the white Philips Sonicare Protective Clean Toothbrush actually clean a bit better, even though I didn't think it was possible as the Oral-B already did a great job.  However, it definitely gives me a super clean feeling in my mouth and after having used this for the past few weeks, I'm definitely using this as my go to toothbrush over the Oral-B.  It also comes with a handy storage case which will be great for when I travel, as I hate using manual toothbrushes now.  The gum care mode on the toothbrush feels like it's massaging my gums and is quite soothing, so I use it everyday before bed as part of my oral care routine.  Overall, for about $80 MSRP I get everything I want in a toothbrush without wasting money on gimmicks like a rinsing glass, fancy case and fancy charging station.

When I first received the Philips Sonicare 4500, I was a bit skeptical because the glue used to close the box had not done its job properly and one flap was left open. Once I removed the contents, I was relieved to see that everything inside was sealed, and there was no tampering with my product… phew. Now that I know that the toothbrush is in proper condition, I was able to give this product an unbiased review…The Philips Sonicare 4500 is the epitome of toothbrushes. From an aesthetic standpoint, to the operational use. Aesthetically it looks slick. The matte black finish, along with the slim body of the brush gives it that premium look. I have used electric toothbrushes before but this one looks beautiful.I previously had used an Oral B toothbrush, where the head of the brush rotates. After using the Philips Sonicare 4500, I threw the Oral B out. The vibrations give a nice massage, to your gums and clean effectively.I am happy to say that I will continue to purchase Philips Sonicare toothbrushes!

I might just be in love with my new Philips Sonicare 4500 ProtectiveClean Gum Health Toothbrush!What I really like:- compact on the counter - unlike other electric toothbrushes, this one takes up very little counter space.  The charging disk is tiny- The toothbrush holds a charge for around 2 weeks - perfect for a trip where you don't want to take the charger- it comes with a travel case- my teeth felt really clean - just like after visiting the dentist- the pressure sensor is great - i have a tendency to brush too hard and this toothbrush tells me that- it tells me when to replace the brush head- quadpacer and smart timer help ensure that my whole mouth gets brushed...not missing any spots- recharge light- different mode for gums and teethWhat I didn't appreciate:- the package only came with one brushLots of positives...and a brush I will use in my home.
"
"
This toothbrush is simple to use, and is much better than my competitor's electric toothbrush in power and effectiveness.There's an on-off button, and you can choose from 3 different brush heads (whitening, clean, or gum care - but again, only one speed setting.It's gentle on my gums, and has a sensor that lets me know if I'm pressing too hard.There's a light to show when the toothbrush needs to be recharged (about 2 weeks between charging) as well - which means I don't have to have it plugged in all the time.I also like that the charger takes up minimal space on the counter - everything about this toothbrush = efficiencies!It does lack a travel case, so it will have to stay at home vs going back and forth to the cabin with me on weekends.Overall, it's a great basic super sonic toothbrush that does what it's supposed to do, at a reasonable price.

This Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean Toothbrush 4500 Black HX6820/60 does a great job of cleaning my teeth. This is my first Philips sonic electric toothbrush I have used and I am impressed with it.i have been using another brand name electric toothbrush for years that i bought from Amazon because the price was good, cheaper than the Philips and I thought I was getting a good clean until I used this Philips SonicCare.The Philips SonicCare has a smaller diamond shape head that reaches in hard to get places to clean and remove plaque that my other toothbrush could not do.It took a little getting used to as you do not have to press hard down to get a good clean like I was doing with the other brush.I love the case it comes with I can take it with me when I am travelling, very compact and handy.Effectiveness=10Handling=10Appearance=10Price Point=9

Philips keeps knocking it out of the park with the Sonicare line of toothbrushes.  They do have some that have way too many features for a toothbrush but if you bring back a little, they have a great selection like this one that does everything you need for perfect checkup at the dentist.What separates this one is that it has a mode for brushing  your gums.  Generally the normal speed might be a bit much and a little abrasive directly on your gums so this one has a gentler mode specifically for that.  Lightly brushing your gums is important for gum health so this is a welcomed option.The initial cost of one of these might seem a bit high but replacement brush heads are fairly inexpensive.  For the significantly better results that you will get using one of these compared to a conventional toothbrush, it's completely worth the investment.

I totally love this toothbrush. I’ve used the circular head power brushes but this one is better. I find that it cleans better and just feels more comfortable in the hand. The body is sleek and narrow and I like that. The cleaning head is easy to manoeuver and easily reaches all teeth without effort.  The built-in timer is handy and helps you switch to a different quadrant as you brush. There’s plenty of power and the battery lasts a long time between charges. The main issue that I have with these power brushes are the heads themselves. They are too expensive. So what I do is brush with my regular (old fashioned toothbrush) for 3 – 5 days and then for the next couple of days I do a deep cleaning with my powered brush. So I’m saving a ton of money on heads and my teeth are still super clean! In fact, I don’t think anyone needs to use a powered brush EVERY day!

I personally use the Phillips Series 3 which is about $20 cheaper than this model.  We haven't used this model enough to realize the features like the brushhead change reminder.  The pressure sensor seems to work well but overall I'm not sure I'm missing much with my series 3.The series 3 also has three speed settings while this unit only has two.  I generally only use one setting so this probably doesn't matter either way.I do like the black handle though! I think it looks nicer than the series 3 does.  I think overall it's worth the extra $20 for the additional features, but if it needs special brush heads that cost more than the series 3 brush heads, then it's probably not worth it.Overall I'm a fan of the Sonicare brushes, I think they are better than the oral B alternative.

I love this brush. For just a few dollars more than the entry level model, this brush comes with a case and a clean or gum toothbrush setting. The next step is a $50 increase which would include a whitening option as well but this is a great introductory brush to the sonicare line.I am actually pretty impressed by this. I feel like my teeth are much cleaner than after using a regular spin brush. I don't feel like I have as much gunk between my teeth when I floss after brushing. If you floss before the vibrations will help get out even more gunk. It has a battery indicator and a brush head indicator to tell you when to change that as well. It will let you know if you are pushing too hard with specific vibrations. Great investment for your our oral health.

This Philips Sonicare toothbrush is between basic and middle-basic on a chart from basic to fancy.In my opinion this is the basic Sonicare, with a gum feature. The brush pattern is slightly different with this gum feature. And this seems to be the only difference between this and the basic, besides noticeable price increase.Pressure sensitive, so it will let you know if you're pressing too hard.The stand-up charger keeps the brush up and out of the way.I give this 5 stars because it works just as well as the basic, and these brushes have proven to be better and more reliable than crest or oral-b brushes, in my personal experiences.
"

I became a fan of Sonicare from Philips a while ago after trying their electronic toothbrush. Teeth cleaning had never been so pleasant. The vibration cleans teeth and massages gum well but is also gentle enough. After brushing, my teeth definitely feels much cleaner.Good battery life of the rechargeable battery. Love the sleek design of the toothbrush. Definitely push the brushing game to a new level!
"
"
I have had 3 sonicare brushes and they really are great. I enjoy brushing with them a little more  and they leave you with a very clean feeling mouth.no doubt they are worth the price. However I removed 1 star because I don't think the more expensive models really add anything over the base models. I don't notice any difference in the brushing modes besides the time. This one does have a nice travel case though
"
"
I love this toothbrush and the extra gum care feature. The plaque mode definitely cleans plaque well, same with the other sonicare toothbrushes ive used. This is still a somewhat base model of sonicare, just an extra feature which is the gum mode. The real thing that i notice compared to a regular old manual brush is my teeth feel smooth as silk after brushing, just like a dentists visit with a polishing.

I have tried a number of manual tooth brushes and these are in the top 2!The bristles were nice and soft. The fact that the bristles go in different directions really makes my teeth feel cleaner.The handle is large and easy to grip.Nothing is as good as an electric toothbrush, but these are a good alternative.

I would never pay $20 for a single toothbrush in my life. Rip-off

Great toothbrushes. Much less expensive to buy them on Amazon than the grocery store.

After starting off with Soft, Colgate MaxFresh Medium is the only toothbrush I buy.The packaging says Medium on the ones I received, but the brush feels very much like a Soft, strange!

The toothbrush itself is great along the gravel case and the standThat being said, the bluetooth is useless the 2nd day of usage because nobody's gonna take it their phone in the bathroom every morning to follow their brushing habitsAnd all the brushing mode is pretty useless too in my opinionI seriously think that if I would be doing a blind test, I couldn't tell the difference between this one and a less expensive toothbrushIf you want the case and the stand, buy it separately and will save yourself tons of money

My dentist had been nagging me to get an Electric Toothbrush for as long as I can remember because my gums were no longer protecting the root of my teeth - I was putting too much effort brushing up and down.  I finally got this electric toothbrush.  I see now the difference between brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush versus an electric one.  It won't reverse the damage I did to my gums, but at least it is now under control. Good investment.
"
"
I bought this as an upgrade and replacement of my 8 yr old Oral B electric toothbrush. This toothbrush comes with a neat little covered container for 4 brush heads. There's also a battery indicator to indicate when charged for use.The 1st thing I noticed is the speed, 10x faster. This is great for brushing along the gum line and in between teeth to remove plaque. The blue tooth works but I didn't rate it because I don't use it.  I do like the 5 different settings which provides more options to brushing your teeth.  I recently had a wisdom tooth pulled and the sensitive setting was not too harsh on the healing gums.  I also liked the pro setting which can be used to brush each quadrant of your teeth for 45 secs.  Or, you can set it to go off at the 2 min dentist recommended mark.Overall, a great product and value for the money.
"
"
Got the upgrade bug one night and decided to get something new to replace my triumph. 1st, this was a waste of time and I should give my head a shake.. what possible upgrade could a vibrating brush have.. Outside of a slightly longer battery life, zero difference. When buying these, buy the cheapest one.. i'm sure its the same motor in all. You won't use all the modes, you don't need to see which mode it is.. and it is ridiculous oralB charges so much more to have a mode icon on the level above this. They could cut their lineup to 3 brushes.. basic, one that has all features, and the top travel version. And bluetooth is a joke.. whos actually gonna run an app prior to brushing? The exec that came up with this should be fired, but how else would OralB flog an ""upgrade""? And as others have said, the charging light is BRUTAL. First night it was like we had rented a room in a seedy motel next to a flashing neon sign out the window.. closed the door to the bathroom but the door edges would glow on and off.. on and off.. on and off like a scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Really poorly thought out product. You could tell this was just rushed out with no thought at all to any of it. Cash grab. Stick with your old one.
"
"
Bought this toothbrush for my wife's Christmas gift. When she tried it she immediately loved it She said that she could really feel the difference and that she would not go back to her old manual tooth brush. I also bought the 12 pack of additional brushes that magnificently complements the brush.
"
"
My old electric toothbrush, one of the lower end ones from Oral B, died so I decided to upgrade to this one. It really does the job. My teeth feel super clean after I use it. The features are all really nice, I particularly like the pressure sensor because I guess I never knew I was brushing too hard before. The timer is really handy, it goes off every 30 seconds to indicate to move to a different part of your mouth. Before I was just guessing at timing but this toothbrush makes it extremely easy and foolproof to brush your teeth properly. The bluetooth feature is nice, if you're somebody who likes to keep track of your brushing.I also find that this model is much easier to keep clean than my old one. With the brush head stand attached it gives you a place to put them, so that you are cleaning the entire thing every time.The travel case is indeed cheap plastic but it does the job of a travel case just fine, although I find that the brush heads fall out of their slots really easily, so be careful when you're opening it after travel.I would recommend this toothbrush to somebody who is willing to shell out a bit more in terms of cost for some nice extra features. If you're not interested in the bluetooth or different modes or anything like that, it's probably not worth it. But it was exactly what I was looking for.
"
"
I've being using it for a month and I love it. This is my  first electric brush so there is nothing to compare it to, except regular brushes and battery powered ones, but boy, there is such a difference between battery powered one and electric. This one just have way to much more power and I just can't imagine going back to the old way of brushing my tooth. There is iOS app that you can synch with your phone with Bluetooth and get info how you brush, whether you put too much pressure, the leght of your sessions, also there are personal plans with instructions, like if you  have soar or swollen gums it tells you  how to brush and with which mode (as it has 5 modes of brushing) to help your gums.It has Braun motor, German technology, and those Germans rocks.  I will absolutely recommend it.
"
"
Software nags at me to brush my teeth. Different modes for different goals (whiten, daily, etc) Way better than the old basic $50 oral b. Makes me almost enjoy brushing..only thing I don't appreciate are the ads in the software that encourage me to buy more stuff, but at least its related to mouth care.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned. I had an Oral-B electric brush for over 20 years and it worked fine until my daughter dropped it and cracked the battery.I expect this unit to last as long.I love the Bluetooth feature with the iPhone app... although I forget to use it most days and just resort to brushing normally without the phone. Definitely a recommended product.
"

This is a great toothbrush and I am vey pleased with my purchase. I bought this product after I read about it online and how pleased many people were with it. They are right this is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned and will probably ever own. It has a host of features that are great such as Bluetooth compatibility so you can connect to a smart phone and track your progress. I find the app to be useful but I can see any people abandoning it down the road. I have stopped using the app myself because I find it more cumbersome than just putting on the brush head and brushing my teeth. It has a bunch of different brushing modes to help you achieve whatever you want. Me personally I just use the daily clean mode and sometimes the deep clean mode depending on how I feel. The toothbrush works very well and my mouth feel super clean after using it. The brush head allows me to maneuver around my mouth and reach those hard to reach places better than an ordinary brush. The visible pressure sensor is great too because sometimes you might not realize that you’re applying more force when maneuvering around to tight spots.  I like the customization that you can have with the toothbrush by switching modes, brush heads and playing with that to find what works best for you. The battery life is fantastic I can go a full 7 days without charging and using twice daily. Charging is super easy just dock it in the wireless charging dock and leave it alone. I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to have a super clean mouth. The power from this thing is incredible.

Seems to be useful. 5 power modes including Deep Clean to gum massage. The handle lights up if you hold it tightly. The brush will stop if you press too hard on the teeth. The enclosed  manual is easy to read.Took 18 hours to fully charge the battery. Should last for at least two week of brushing twice a day (2 - 3 minutes each session).There is the option of seven different brushes (extra purchase) to clean your teeth. FlossAction, 3D White, Sensitive Gum, Ortho Bush, Deep Sweep, Power Tip.
"
"
Have been using this toothbrush for over one year now. Never had any issue brushing, charging, or connecting with my phone.The product itself is dependable and convenient to use; however, the Oral-B app is not well-designed to match their great products.
"
"
I have used an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years but finally decided to retire my previous brush and am I ever glad I did.  The new brush is easier to hold, has multi-settings and looks much nicer.  Charging stand is a huge improvement over the old one as well and like that it came with a carrying case. Love the black!  Feel like it does a much better job of cleaning than the old brush did.  Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
You can go for the cheaper versions as the Bluetooth/App functions while interesting really are not something the average person has time for.  The tooth brush works great but I can't imagine the avg person using the App and Bluetooth functions regularly.  Very fast delivery
"
"
I mostly use just the regular ""daily clean"" mode and it keeps my teeth white and super clean all day! I always used to use a manual toothbrush and white strips and then I decided to give an electric toothbrush a try because my boyfriend said they were so much better. I can see where he's coming from because the clean feeling after you brush your teeth is like when you come out of the dentist. I love it! And I bought this version for the ""whitening "" mode so that I wouldn't have to buy white strips anymore and I am SO glad I did! Even just the ""daily clean "" mode whitens and then the actual ""whitening"" mode increases that! I would recommend this to everyone!!
"
"
I was disappointed in this toothbrush. It lost its charge after the first 5 days. I wish there was a pressure sensor on the toothbrush itself and a way to tell what mode it is in without using the app. It cleans fine but should have bought one without the Bluetooth features. I don’t really want to bring my phone into the bathroom everytime I brush my teeth.
"
"
So far I love this toothbrush. Didn't think much of the BlueTooth connection at first, but after a week, I have found myself using the app more. I can look at calendar events and weather and news while I'm brushing my teeth.
"
"
The toothbrush works great, but the app is my favourite part. You can add pre set programs to help with your dental hygiene goals. You can also tailor your own program with the assistance of your dental hygienist. It had a built in timer which buzzes when it’s time to change sections of your mouth. I have nothing bad to say about this toothbrush
"
"
This is a toothbrush.I can be used to brush your teeth.The reason I gave this 3/5 is because it's too noisy IMO. My partner has one that only emits a slight humming sound, I plan to get rid of this one and buy one of those instead.
"
"
This toothbrush is awesome. I'm a first time electric toothbrush user. My teeth feels like I just had a cleaning at the dentist. I'm starting to have more staining problem from coffee, cigarette and wine. Seems to stain faster than it used too. Well with this toothbrush it really reduces that.
"
"
Worth every penny! Picked up this badboy during amazon prime day and it has done wonders for my oral hygiene in a matter of weeks. I also bought a waterpik (water flosser) to create a daily routine. Check out my review there! If you’re someone who currently does not have dental coverage, buy both of these items and you’ll be set!
"
"
Great product. Came quickly and in good condition. Various settings allow for a cleaner mouth feel. One thing I would criticized is the fact that the app is not compatible with Android phones, which seems to be an ongoing issue.
"
"
Works perfect giving an excellent brush.  Excellent product.  Most will not use all the feature rich modes but if you are looking for an all around excellent electric tooth brush, this one will do the trick.
"
"
Not that I needed a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush but it was on sale. Problem is I rarely take my phone with me into the bathroom where I brush my teeth and therefore never activate the app. I also generally leave it on the same speed so the other 4 speeds while nice to have are rarely used.
"
"
This Oral B 5000 really does a good job on your teeth.  The bluetooth capabilty is very much dependent on your phones ability to be able to handle Bluetooth 4.0 or higher.  My phone could not handle it and my tablet wasn't capable of being updated to newer software.  I did get in touch with Oral B, explained the problem and they kindly sent me one of their Smartguides.  This works with the bluetooth of the brush and you are able to use it the same way as you would the downloaded app.  Kudos to Oral B and P&G for having super customer service reps.
"
"
Brushes really well but the battery in ours is faulty, it never shows a full charge, usually only 1of3, no good for Travel because it doesn't hold enough charge. We can only use it 3 times per day or the battery dies, even though it says you can use it 10 times between charges.
"
"
Replaced an older oralB which did not hold a charge and slowed down.  I didn't know how much so until this new unit.  A negative would be the almost useless Bluetooth feature and the needlessly bright blue LEDs which unintentionally act as a night light in the bathroom.
"
"
I do not understand the point of adding Bluetooth functionality if the app itself doesn’t write to HealthKit. Such a tragic and grotesque waste for a product with so much potential. I’ll be returning this overpriced toothbrush promptly.
"
"
It was time to replace my 10 year old Oral-B Vitality and I'm amazed how much better this product is. The head oscillates so much faster and makes your teeth feel truly clean. I can't say much about all the gimicks like the bluetooth app, which might be interesting, but not really needed. All I want is a tooth brush that does its job and that it does. Very happy!
"
"
Je regrette le fait qu’il faut allumer l’application Bluetooth, pour voir le minuteur. Si vous n’allumez pas, ça ne prends pas en compte vos « objectifs »L’appli se veut ludique mais je ne m’en sert jamais.Brosse à dent et batterie parfait
"
"
I've had Oral B products before, but this model has a very useful red light indicator that shows when the brush is pushed too hard against the teeth and, what is even more important, the gums. There is a choice of not too overpriced brushes for different needs. However, the claim that one charge last for about a week is not true. It needs to be recharged every every 4 to 5 days.
"
"
Love this toothbrush! It leaves my teeth feeling just-been-to-the-dentist clean, and the app is so much cooler and useful than you might think. I scoffed at it at first, but now I think it's great!
"
"
J'aime vraiment beaucoup, le seul hic est l'application bluetooth que je trouve un peu lourde à utiliser mais pour le brossage des dents c'est vraiment parfait
"
"
Brush does a very nice job,quiet also. The only thing I don't like is that I have to have my phone with me to get the alarm stating that I brushed enough.
"
"
A great electric toothbrush that comes with an upgraded lithium ion battery, a travel case and a charging station. My dentist recommended Oral B as a replacement for my old electric toothbrush. I agree, and highly recommend this model electric brush.
"
"
I figured the bluetooth would be a waste of money, I was right. However I like the toothbrush, wireless charging is nice.  The pressure sensor works well.
"
"
It look the same in the pic with good quality
"
"
This product works well. Does a much better cleaning job than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Great improvement over Oral B Vitality. The app is a total waste of time.
"
"
The product comes as advertised and does the job better than any manual or cheap vibrating toothbrush. The battery life lasts about 2 weeks with twice daily usage.
"
"
This was my first electric toothbrush so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do love it. Just wish it charged faster.
"
"
Love my new Oral-B it’s a must have for your brushing needs there is honestly no better toothbrush out there right now
"
"
love the new toothbrush feels great to use takes a while to charge though and mine came a little dinged up
"
"
Le produit rempli plus que mes attentes. Solide pratique, qualité supérieure et quelle travail il fait pour mes dents. Je le recommande fortement.

Bought one for my wife and other family members as it was the best toothbrush I’ve used.
"
"
very pleased with my electric tooth brush.  I have to turn it down as it is very powerfull.  Also do not push too hard.  Have taken it on 4 day trips without charger and it worked very well.  Bought some more brushes and now my wife is using it.
"
"
My Oral-b pro 5000 only lasted 3 months and when we contacted the company there was no response
"
"
Charger not working and Braun cannot replace it free, you need to buy it from them and pay shipping cost. Not a great warranty.
"
"
Although it discharges sometimes when it shouldn't it seems to work well.
"
"
The product was exactly as advertised. It was reasonably priced and arrived one day earlier than expected.
"
"
Had the older model and still use it, was manually brushing before this brush is a game changer. Dental cleaning time majorly reduced.
"
"
Fabulous for what it’s designed for - cleaning teath
"
"
The product was easy to use and it has 5 modes which helps us brush more effectively. Would definitely recommend
"
"
Really good. I don't think I will use the smart aspect, but the unit works very well.
"
"
Got it on black friday for sale and it's a really good toothbrush.

If you're happy to be nagged by your toothbrush, then buy this one. It connects by bluetooth to an app in your cell phone, so you'll  need to take your phone or tablet into the bathroom with you. I'd hoped it might connect to the timer gizmo of my previous Oral B Smart toothbrush which had finally died after four or five years, but it wasn't able to.The phone app measures the duration of your cleaning, the average time spent cleaning your teeth, the pressure applied and then encourages you to clean your tongue and use a mouthwash. I gave up caring after a few days.However, without the testimony of my dentist I suspect this is an excellent toothbrush. It certainly feels as if it's going a good job and is robust and powerful. My one small quibble is the brightness of the charging light. We have a frosted glass door on our en suite and the charging toothbrush throws a ghostly blue glow into the bedroom!
"
"
Oral B pro 5000 smart series. The first brushing, it may seem loud & feel almost too powerful, but by the 2nd, brushing there is no problem. It will make your teeth feel much cleaner. I like the timer as I brush longer. The pressure sensor does work; there will be a  red light. If the blue lights are on when you feel you have bushed long enough, click on the arrow to turn it off, or the battery will drain.The first 1 we purchased was from a local pharmacy, & cost us  almost $80.00 more than when purchased from Amazon; so do your price comparison. Do buy this toothbrush.... happy smiling.
"
"
First, it is too noisy and second, when using the brush itself you never know what mode is on unless you connect it to your cellphone. When you start the brush, it always starts in the same mode and you need to memorize the five modes if your cellphone is not around. The battery does not last too much when not in the charger ( no more than 2 uses)
"
"
It feels to stiff, and I was disappointed that the kit only comes with one  toothbrush but I have to say it does work, it does a good job
"

So I'm about as skeptical as one can get when it comes to electric toothbrushes. My Dentist is always nagging me about my dislike for them and my love for my good old manual toothbrush. I mean, what can this thing do that my trusty manual can't? My arm has good power. I'm a good brusher. I follow the technique the dentist gave me! But I was so wrong, so very very wrong. The Oral B Smart Series 5000 Toothbrush with bluetooth is AWESOME. First of all, it has power. This is not some wimpy battery operated model. It really feels like a dentist polishing when I use the ""deep clean"" setting. Second, let's talk about those settings. Five. You have five settings to choose from! They all work a little differently, some go for a bit longer than two minutes. There's a whitening setting, deep cleaning and so on. Next,  let's talk about the brush itself. You can get different models but the one that came with it is round, as shown. I think this shape and size is what really helps get into all those crevices and little spots behind your molars. I mean, when I did the tongue swipe, I've never felt my teeth so clean except after a dentist cleaning!Then there's the fact that it comes with a travel case. That's a nice feature because how else are you going to pack it and keep it sanitary? Really glad they thought of that and included it, nice touch. The little case to store your brush heads (for families who share the motor part, I guess?) is nice too. Keeps it clean and fresh for your next use.The Bluetooth feature is where this loses a star for me. It's a great idea but I found the app that goes with it a little picky. If you keep your bluetooth on constantly, this probably won't be an issue for you but it was for me since I turn bluetooth off when I'm not using it. So because I turn it off, I have to ""sync"" the brush when I turn on the bluetooth the next time. The app says how to do it and that does work but I've found it doesn't always catch every brushing that's happened since it's last sync. As of right now, my app told me I've missed 10 brushings which I assure you, I haven't! I also don't like that when you set up the app, it asks for a TON of permissions. It shouldn't need access to my camera or my picture album. The good news is that once you install the app you can go in and turn the access to things like that off and keep it basic if you prefer.Okay so that negative aside (and it's really minor!), this brush really does do a great job. Another feature is that it buzzes when it's time to move from one quadrant to the next while brushing, so you don't lose track of how long to brush! It also has a red light that glows if you're using too much pressure when brushing, which is good because sometimes I get a little enthusiastic. It's important not to go too hard because of your enamel!So overall, 4/5. It delivers on performance and results. Great motor, great charging station and storage. Just a little bit of tweaking is needed in the app and I'm sure that'll come with an update eventually.Please note that I received this product for free for testing through BzzAgent.

I actually bought this item with my own  money. Trust my review and not one from someone who received it for free. This was my first time trying out an electric toothbrush. I had expectations and hopes that my teeth would feel fresh from the dentist clean. This was not the case. It does the same quality of job as a regular toothbrush. It's a great toothbrush but a regular $2 toothbrush does the same job in my opinion.

*Received product for free from Oral-B*I'm coming from the battery operated Oral-B Pulsar Pro-Health Toothbrush to the Oral-B Pro 5000.  I regularly go to my dentist and have not have any significant dental problems.  I thought I was brushing and flossing alright and according to my dentist, I have.  My pulsar was doing its job.  However, moving to the Pro 5000, I think made my teeth cleaner.At first the Pro 5000, made my gums bleed.  I guess the cleaning head I received was too hard but I kept on using it and until my teeth and gums got used to it.  I'm still getting used to the 2 minute timer built in but as I progress, it became a non issue.  Using the Pro 5000 is like having your dental hygienist brushing your teeth for you.  It's where you hate it at first and eventually settling in and loving it.Overall, I would definite recommend the product.  But I wish  I was given the opportunity to try the other cleaning heads to fully see what this product is capable of.Pros:Packing looks nice and clean.Different ModesBluetooth ConnectivityDifferent Brush HeadsTeeth Feels CleanerTeeth look whiterConsThe brush head I received was a little bit too hard to my gums at first.  And I wish I could get the different brush heads to review.Wish it came with the Smart Guide

The toothbrush is great it clean really well and the connection to the app on your phone will make it easy to track your activity. I have this toothbrush for over 9 months now. Fully charging your toothbrush will last you 5-7 days. I didn't have the battery issue other reviews talked about, but because I fully charge the toothbrush and then disconnect the charger and use the battery (I guess that's what keep my battery in shape). I haven't tried the Sonicare though to be able to compare both of them (I know most people are confused between both), but it does the job
"
"
To start, I should mention that I was lucky enough to receive this Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity toothbrush free from Oral-B through a BzzAgent campaign. This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it. If you asked me a few weeks ago if I would have purchased an electric toothbrush, I would have probably said no. But after using this toothbrush for a week now, I have to be honest and say that I don’t think I can ever go back to a manual brush!This toothbrush gives me a dentist clean feeling after each use and is simple to use.  I charged it overnight after taking it out of the box and it was good to go the next morning.  I have used it twice a day for the last week and it still has at least half the charge.After downloading the Oral-B app, I was surprised to find out that I wasn't brushing nearly long enough. The toothbrush vibrates when you are brushing too hard or when it's time to move to another quadrant of teeth to ensure you are brushing all your teeth. The App is easy to set up and easy to select a program to follow.
"

I think I truly like the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth connectivity.I received it free from Oral B to try out and am totally appreciative that I did!When I first used the toothbrush I wasn't convinced that I was going to like it. The vibrations were a bit intense and I don't mind visiting the Dentist for a good cleaning but that only happens twice a year. Having my teeth cleaned with the vibrations everyday took some getting used to. Once I did, I could never go back to a regular toothbrush!Absolute bonus that I can connect to the Oral-B app and time my brushing and collect trophies! Love the trophies! Makes me feel like a kid again!I've always thought I brushed long enough and didn't apply too much pressure. I've learned otherwise and am grateful for the knowledge. Always been a freak about clean teeth and the fact that the toothbrush and app made me aware that I was applying too much pressure at times was a welcome tool. You brush too fast, the toothbrush hesitates until you release pressure.If you want a clean, fresh feeling set of teeth, this tooth brush is the perfect choice!

Thanks to Oral B, I have received this Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series Electric Brush for free to try. What a surprise this is! I was always a manual brush type of person. I have an electric toothbrush when I was a child and did not like it at all. I probably used a couple of times and thought the manual way is better for me. Until I tried this Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series with Bluetooth. This is the most amazing toothbrush ever, it has blown me by surprise how clean my teeth are. It seriously feels like I have just got my teeth cleaned from the dentist after using this toothbrush.I'm also a gadget type of person and this is my new and coolest gadget. It is not only easy to sync to the app on my phone, it literally tells you everything on how you should be brushing. The app also keeps track of your progress, in weeks and months. This is not just any electric toothbrush, I think this is the new generation of of brushing. This is seriously my new obsession  and never thought I would love brushing my teeth so much. The Oral B Smart Series makes it so much fun! I strongly recommend this product and should definitely try it out if you want sparkling clean healthy teeth.

I LOVE how clean my teeth feel. I was previously using a manual toothbrush and I always assumed I was doing a pretty good job, until I got this. The brush connects to an app on your phone which allows you to see how well you are brushing your teeth, makes sure you are brushing for two minutes, shows which quadrant of your mouth you should be brushing and reminds you to floss. The app also can connect to the local news and weather so that you can check it out while you brush. This is pretty amazing, everyone likes to be graded, but the toothbrush is great on it's own. It rumbles every 30 seconds to remind you to switch your brushing area and flashes red when you are pressing too hard. I have learned that I have been pressing way too hard when brushing my teeth and probably not regularly reaching the 2 minute mark. This brush helps me to take my time brushing my teeth and makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist. I can't wait to try some of the other brush heads, although the one that came with the package is excellent. The brush takes a while to charge, but once it is ready, it will stay charged for several days, which is amazing. It comes with a travel case as well which would allow you to go away from home for a few days without lugging along a charger. Perfect for people who travel out of town for business (like me!!!). I received this product for free from Oral-B for my honest review.

I received the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity from Bzz Agent to test and review. This is not my very first electric toothbrush however it has been awhile since I have used one.You're getting 5 brush modes, a vibration and light-flash pattern every 25% into the cycle and the immensely satisfying finish that the brush head provides. While brushing your teeth and spend too much time in one area, the brush wakes you up with bursts of slowing vibrating pulses and a gentle yellowish light to let you know to move on. If you are not gentle enough with the placement of the brush, it will glow red and slow down the pulsations. The toothbrush trains you, to brush properly. I like that you can switch brush heads to share with others that it came with a charger and a case. My teeth are cleaner than they’ve been in a while. This is a multi-functioning toothbrush, but has no indicator for what mode you are in, too bad the app does not indicate this. The app is useless if you plan on sharing the brush with the family will only track one person.Over all I would highly recommend this Oral B brush my dentist sees an improvement which is really what counts.

First off, thank you Oral-B (Braun) forgiving me this awesome Bluetooth toothbrush to trial!! Prior to purchasing one of these Bluetooth connected toothbrushes I would read some reviews, but after trying it.....I'm sold! The Oral-B Pro 5000 with Bluetooth is an amazing product. It holds a charge for almost two weeks brushing twice a day for 3 minutes each time, you can get separate brush heads for everyone in the family, monitor your kids brushing habits, not to mention it really cleans your teeth well.....it gets around behind your back molars with ease and has 5 different brush settings. I will continue to use the Oral-B Pro 5000 from now on, it is truly incredible!! Great product Braun!

I received this product as part of a promotional campaign by the manufacturer. I owned toothbrushes like this before but the fact that it was bluetooth enabled was kinda intriguing.As soon as I used it the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the app on the phone. There was no need to connect the brush with bluetooth first. The Oral-B app found it right away and I was ready within minutes. The app also shows the progress of your brushing as well as if you are brushing too hard. I was very pleased to see that after I was done, it reminded me to brush my tongue, floss and use mouthwash. At each step, you have to acknowledge it is completed. If you put the app on an iPad, it also displays news information to keep you distracted which is a bonus.Overall, I found the whole experience very pleasant. It keeps me in check and sends me reminders that I need to brush with app notifications. I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially to technology driven individuals that like the thrill of a smart toothbrush.

I recently received an Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries toothbrush. I generally brush my teeth twice a day and use a mouthwash as well to help kill additional germs. I always figured my manual brushing was doing a decent job until I tried this electric toothbrush. I was surprised at truly how well it gets into the spaces between your teeth and how clean your mouth feels by the time you are done. There is a significant difference in how my teeth feel. It's not often you find a product that lives up to the hype of providing a superior cleaning. The only downfall I have with the toothbrush and it's an issue with me, I still have all 4 wisdom teeth so the motor does have to work a bit when I try to get to the very back due to the lack of space, where I can force a manual toothbrush back there and not think twice.Charging the toothbrush does take a while for the first time. We live in an older house that is lacking a plug in the bathroom so I tend to use the toothbrush for multiple sessions before charging again and I can get over a week on a single charge. I have connected the bluetooth up on a Samsung core phone without any problem but I tend not to use it. The toothbrush sends a pulse through the brushing head and flashes a light when it's time to move on to the next section. The app does remind you to floss and use mouthwash but I just don't see myself using it in the long run.I would definitely recommend this product for everyone.This product was received from Oral-B for testing and review.

I recieved the oral b smart series 5000 power toothbrush from OralB to try for free.I have to say that this tooth brush is amazing .Itcleans like going to the dental hygienist every day.You can choose different brush setting for different goals from whitening to braces care to gum health.My teeth felt so clean from the first use .It was so much better than my manual or my battery power toothbrush in terms of cleaning.I choose a whitening program to test the brush and I feel there is a visible difference and the give the tools on your phone to measure the difference in the whitening of your teeth.The instructions state let the brush do the work and it is true all you have to do is move it from tooth to tooth.The blue tooth was fun and was helpful to keep track of when you brush but the timer and vibrations to switch areas were useful as well.

I received the Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series Electric Power Toothbrush With Bluetooth to use and review from Oral B.  I have to say I was a little skeptical at first.  I was a manual kind of toothbrush person.  Now converted.  The app was easy to install on my phone and the setup process was super quick.  Just a few clicks and it was done.  It has several oral care journeys.  I chose the whitening one.  Who doesn't want a dazzling smile?  After a couple of weeks of using the whitening mode, I have to say to my surprise it actually worked!  my teeth are noticeably whiter!! The screen shows you which quadrant of your mouth your should be brushing in, then vibrates when you need to switch areas.  The handle of the toothbrush will flash red when you are brushing too hard.  It was easy to reach my back teeth as well.  It truly does give you the smooth fresh from the dentist feel.  With the app you also lock different brushing achievements. I thought that this would be fun so I let my 3 year old try the toothbrush too.  He hates brushing his teeth but thought this was great fun and loved watching the timer and all the bells and whistles that come with the app.  I had to get his his own brush head so he would stop using mine.  I really do like the app and the toothbrush but I just can't figure out how to set an oral care journey for each person.  I also wish it would give you second to two between each quadrant of brushing to have time to spit.  All in a great toothbrush.  Fun app with achievements to unlock.  Kiddo approved. Really does give you smooth clean fresh from the dentist feel.

2 weeks ago I Oral B sent me this toothbrush for free.  I am absolutely love it,  thank you thank you.  I tenderly call it my new addiction.  I am addicted to the ""clean feeling"" my teeth feel each and every time i brush.  I love how the head glows red and stops when press the brush hard against my teeth. but what does the green mean?  incredible.  But wait there is more.  The very first time I used it it made crunching sounds.  when i was finished i realized that it had removed plaque that was built up between my teeth.  WOW!!!! Holy Clean Oral B.  I only thought my teeth would be this clean leaving the dentist office.  Nope, this clean at home.  I am loving the portability of it too.  I recently went away over night and the head and handle fit very neatly in the travel case provided by Oral B.  Oral B thought of every thing.  An app to track the brushing progress, sadly i am a blackberry user so can not access the app. :( , a charger, free head, free travel case and a storage compartment for the extra heads.  I strongly recommend this toothbrush, and I bet that once you try it you will say "" I am NEVER using a manual brush again"" just like I did yesterday.

I would like to thank Oral-B for giving me the opportunity to try their product for free.I have been using this product for 3 days now and i fell in love with it , with its 5 brushing modes,  you can choose whatever mode suits you , it feels like i just came out in the dentist office, feels like i had an oral prophylaxis at home ,the bristles are soft and does the work really well,you dont have to sweat as you do with your  manual toothbrush, feels good with just one click of the button , another thing that impresses me is that it has a bluetooth connectivity and apps which is so user friendly , not only that i am sure i am doing it the proper way it also tells you how to do it the right way,with the guide on your Oral-B app, the timer, the pressure sensor as it changes colors .Not to mention you can also read the news updates and the weather while brushing ,what a fun way to brush your teeth , now i am sure i won't get bored while brushing with this feature. I will surely buy extra brush heads for the entire family as it comes with the brush head compartment. My teens can't wait to try it .I will proudly recommend this product to my friends and family .

I had actually been researching various brands of electric toothbrushes and trying to decide which one to purchase for my family, so I was thrilled when I received an invitation to review the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity. I received this product for free from Oral-B in exchange for an honest review.At first glance, it appears to be simple enough to use, there's an obvious power button and then another button with a ""V"" that you press to change to the different modes. I've read that there are 5 different modes (daily clean, gum care, sensitive, whitening, and deep clean), but to be honest, I have a hard time differentiating which mode I'm in after pressing the button a few times, because there is nothing to indicate which is which. I know that the toothbrush head spins more furiously and in different directions for certain modes, but I know that as soon as I turn the brush on, it's at the daily clean mode and that is generally fine for my needs. If you are really particular about being on a particular setting, then this might be a sticking point for you, but this doesn't really change anything for me.I also had some difficulty pairing my phone (and I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge) to the toothbrush at first because the bluetooth pairing kept asking for a pincode.  There was no pincode to enter, so I guessed 0000 and 1111, the usual standards.  Nothing worked. When I was getting out of the app, thinking that it wasn't working, the app somehow indicated that my phone was successfully paired to the toothbrush. Even with a bit of a bumpy start with the set up, don't get me wrong--I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush. I don't bring my phone into the bathroom with me every time I brush my teeth because I think it's too much of a hassle (and I don't want to get my phone wet by accident), but I have brought it in to use the app and like that the app really helps to keep track of which section of your teeth you should be brushing and helps time you. You can also keep track of whether you've brushed your tongue, flossed, used mouthwash, etc. so it's very thorough.Something that I wish someone had told me from the start was to NEVER turn on the toothbrush (when you have toothpaste on it) before you put it in your mouth! I did that the first time and got toothpaste literally everywhere! Haha! I guess you live and learn! So always have the toothpaste on the brush and in your mouth before you start it.I absolutely love, love, love how clean my teeth feel--it's like that ""just been to the dentist"" kind of clean, and I never felt this way after using my manual toothbrush. In fact, I loved this toothbrush so much after using it a few times that I went out an bought additional toothbrush heads for the whole family (my hubby and two kids).  It's super easy to switch out the toothbrush heads that are colour-coded, and I just make sure they rinse out the toothbrush head before putting it in the little slots on the toothbrush holder. So simple that even my four-year old can use it, and there's a red indicator light that comes on the toothbrush handle when you're brushing too hard! They all love this toothbrush as much as I do! I honestly don't know how we lived without this toothbrush!

First off I would like to thank Oral B for the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotion.I think if you asked me a few weeks ago if I would purchase an electric toothbrush. It was at best a maybe. One with BLUETOOTH. I would have laughed at you... but after only using it 3 days. Hands down it would be YES!!I am surprised to discover I have been brushing my teeth wrong all these years and not nearly long enough. I cannot get over how I have that just left the dentist feeling with this brush.I love the Bluetooth feature that coaches me. I discovered I have been brushing WAY too hard. The App is easy to set up and it is easy to select a program to follow. I am following Gum Health.I have only one small hick up and that was pairing it with my cell. It took a few tries to be successful but I think that was the user. OoopsI will never give this up even though my son was eyeing it the other night.

I was given the chance to try the Oral B Smart Series 5000 electric brush last week as part of a promotion from the brand and so far so good. I am amazed by the clean feeling it gives me after each time I use it. My teeth feel as clean as if I just stepped out of the dentist.I've also installed the app on my phone that connect to the Bluetooth of the brush itself allowing me to track my brushing stats and telling me if I have brushed too hard or not long enough. I believe that it will definitely have a big impact on my next dentist's appointment. I would definitely recommend it.
"

I bought this for my husband during Prime Day and he absolutely loves it! He doesn't play with the app all that much, but he loves how clean his teeth feel. He says that it feels like he just came from the hygienist!

Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth was the best way to protect your teeth and gums... I have had major bleeding with my gumsthen after trying My Oral-B Pro my bleeding was gone... I really liked the pressure sensor and it had polished feeling of my teeth after brushing.I will give five stars because it does work great and my teeth feels really good after brushing!The bluetooth thing is amazing because you can keep track of your progress and see how good you brush your teeth..Everyone should have this very smart brush! Worth buying!

I was given this brush from Oral B as part of a promotion. I have never used an electric tooth brush before. Boy have I been missing out! I love this brush! It cleans my teeth so well, it feels like I just came from the dentist. It has a nice small head so it's easy to reach the back teeth. I like that it has Bluetooth, the app is very easy to use. I can set up to make sure I brush parts that the dentist says I've been missing.I don't think I'll ever go back to a manual brush again! Thanks Oral B!
"

The toothbrush can save a lot of session before syncing, which is useful. Very powerful yet doesnt hurt. Charger is slow but doesnt bother me.The app is OK.
"
"
The battery were dead after using it for three years. I was trying to replace the battery by learning from YouTube, and it's impossible as I don't have those tools to 'glue' the new battery nor to know where to buy the new battery.
"
"
18 months of daily use by two of us, and this thing is still a beast.  Charges fast, solid feel, all the lights still work including the warning red that I'm brushing too hard.  Love this brush.
"
"
Came as expected. sealed new box. product is a gift. But I do know from experience that oral b electric toothbrushes are a great product. Ive had my oral b 9000 for about 10 years now. Never had a problem with it. The battery was full charged 3 days ago and ive been using it at least twice a day, It still has 50% left for a charge.
"
"
excellent product
"
"
La fonction bluetooth est vraiment gadget on s'en sert 5/6 fois au debut puis elle passe vite a la trappe.Pour le reste les fonctions intégrés à la brosse à dents sont vraiment pas mal et pousse à respecter le temps de brossage.
"
"
So in love with this product, love the fact that there are so many different brushes that can go on it, as well as the fact that it keeps track of my brushing , so happy that bzzagent sent me a sample to try and everyone should get one

The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries rechargeable toothbrush did deliver an ultimate clean, as promised.  There are 5 modes to chose from: Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening, and Deep Clean. I received the product for free from Oral-B for review, and have been using the toothbrush for around 3 weeks on the""whitening"" setting. Here's what I found....-there is an in handle timer that pulses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch brushing areas (clean each quadrant for 30 seconds). love that i know how long i have been brushing.-if you brush with too much pressure the handle of the toothbrush will indicate so by lighting up red. Also very helpful.-There is an Oral B app to download on your smartphone and through bluetooth connectivity you are given real time feedback: visuals to show you which quadrant to brush and an indication of when you use too much pressure. To me this seemed redundant as the toothbrush gives you this information anyway. Also, I only remembered to bring the phone with me to the bathroom a couple of times.- A number of brushing sessions are recorded even if you do not have your phone with you. The next time you connect with Bluetooth the data is transferred in case you are interested in looking back at your brushing habits. I was not very interested in my brushing history.- The app will  reward you  for good brushing habits by presenting little ""trophies"". Im not sure if others enjoy this infantilization or needs incentive to maintain good oral hygiene, but I don't.  I find it weird.Overall, I love the clean that this toothbrush delivered. My mouth feels cleaner and healthier compared to when I used a manual toothbrush.I think the Bluetooth connectivity is a useless extra that is used just to sell another new product. This wasn't  invented out of need and I would not pay more for this feature.
"
"
Love my NEW Oral - B Pro 5000 bluetooth toothbrush. Glad I purchased on Amazon Prime day.
"
"
received this item as a tester from BZZAgent to try out. Great packaging, Great brand name, Great offer. Oral B has made this toothbrush with me in mind. It does reach a few areas that are difficult with an ordinary toothbrush. Very compact and an attractive unit. My only complaint is the bluetooth. Unless you have a habit of taking your cellphone to the bathroom I found this feature useless.
"
"
I was very excited to receive this product to test as a BzzAgent representative.  I couldn't wait to get it fully charged and into my mouth! I found that the toothbrush took a great deal of time to charge the first time and the runway of lights on the handle was distracting and annoying in the nighttime (especially when I wake up in the middle of the night and make my way to the restroom). The first time I used the Oral B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity I was was very disappointed! It felt like a jackhammer going off in my mouth! I tried to adjust the settings but had no success in changing how the toothbrush felt in my mouth. And for my efforts, I got toothpaste all over the place as it is very difficult to change settings while it is in your mouth! I thought that I must have been doing something wrong so I read the manual (when all else fails, read the instructions...lol) however; it turned out that I was not doing anything wrong. I tried the brush again the following day with the same results. I haven't tried to master the Bluetooth Connectivity as I was so unhappy with the toothbrush, I haven't used it again. The toothbrush cleaned my teeth well the two times that I used it which is why I have given this a two star rating. There is a possibility that the Oral B Pro 5000 that I received is defective but I have no way of knowing that. I do know that I cannot stand the jackhammer effect in my mouth when I used the toothbrush so I will not be using it again, unfortunately. Given my experience, I cannot recommend this product to my family and friends.

received the product for free from Oral-BIt's a great tooth brush works perfectly but i find that the blue tooth is something that i don't use
"

A good buy if bought for less than $90 on sale. Bluetooth is a USELESS battery drain but can be turned off. This model is MODESTLY better than the Professional 1000 I bought 10 YEARS AGO. My understanding is that any model below the Pro 5000 has a DOWNSIZED BATTERY (only 2/3 the size of my old Pro 1000) resulting in the need to recharge 1.5 times more often and a lifespan only 2/3 as long, and the need to buy a new brush if you are unwilling to perform the necessary ""brain surgery"" needed to replace the battery. IT IS A HUGE MISTAKE to buy any model with the downsized battery, so astute shopping dictates the need to buy a Pro 5000 or higher, if it can be bought a a BIG DISCOUNT. This model is a BAD BUY if bought at the REGULAR PRICE.
"
"
Works just fine, but honestly can't tell the difference from other models for half the price. The Bluetooth feature is pretty much a gimmick. IF you want your usage recorded, you have to pretty much have your phone out each time you brush. It'll store sessions from the past, but honestly how often are you brushing your teeth with your phone out in the bathroom?
"

This model was a replacement for an older Oral-B brush with a failing battery (the battery cannot be replaced). The package consists of the brush, charger/brush head holder, travel case, a regular brush head and instruction manual; the manual lists four models of this brush so it has to be read to determine which features apply to this model : PRO 5000, in my case. The set up was straightforward and it does take the full 24 hours mentioned in the manual to charge the brush. The travel case holds the brush and two brush heads but not the charger. I use a sensitive brush head and it is easy to replace. It is supposed to remember which brushing mode you use (there are five of them), however, I was never able to get it to remember the Sensitive mode. The brush will warn you if you put excessive pressure on your gums. There are very good written and illustrated instructions on using the brush properly; in many years of using these power brushes, I have learned that letting the brush doing the work and just guiding it according to the recommended techniques is the best method. The specifications state a 10-day charge before recharging; with using it about 5 minutes total per day, it lasted one week before needing recharging. This model pairs with the Oral-B Bluetooth app (Android, in my case). Pairing was quick and a full range of features and customization is available to track brushing time, performance, etc., temperature, weather forecast, as well as a news feed that can be customized to 'watch while you brush'. However, from time to time, connectivity with the app was lost and the tracking was skewed as a result. When I signed up for an 8-week gum health program, the app changed my temperature settings to Fahrenheit and stopped recording the full range of dental hygiene I follow - strange. For full functionality, sign up for an Oral-B account. You can choose to have the app record your hygiene program or back it up to your Oral-B account. All in all, this is a very good brush with lots of versatility to adjust to your personal dental hygiene.
"
"
To begin with, I want to acknowledge that I've been using the Oral B products for many years.  My dentist highly recommends it and I believe that it's a very good, useful and necessary product.Having said that, I am not convinced that the extra features of the 5000 model warrants it's extra price.  The reason I chose this model is that it features a special deep clean mode and it has artificial intelligence to tell you how your brushing is doing.  Since I've had problems with plaque build up for years despite using the Oral B products, I was looking forward to both features.I thought that the deep clean mode meant that it would pulsate deeper or something scientific like that.  In reality, all it does is time for 3 minutes (45 second intervals) instead of 2 minutes (30 second intervals).Regarding the AI, I was looking forward to something like, ""hold your brush more horizontal"" or ""brush your gums more.""  Instead, I got ""You pressed too hard for 1.2 seconds.""The product comes with a two month no questions asked return policy.  I haven't decided yet whether it's worth the shipping costs and hassle to return it and buy a lower model.
"
"
Much stronger than my old cheaper electric brush. I got this one when it was on sale on the site for a really great price. If I had paid full price, this rating would be lower, because ultimately, the frills don't seem like they're worth the full list price. The Bluetooth/app connection is interesting, but at the end of the day is just a way to track if you're brushing your teeth properly and for the right amount of time- something you can do yourself every morning and night. I've tried a few of the brushing programs, and I can't really tell much of a difference.The brush itself is well built and holds a charge for a very long time. The stand looks nice too.

My teenage son is terrible at brushing his teeth especially with braces; at his last dentist appointment he got a really bad review and they now want to see him every three months instead of 6. Out of desperation we purchased this toothbrush, downloaded the app, and he’s been using it for the past 2 or 3 weeks, and the results are amazing! I’m so impressed that he using the app, and we’re not seeing a ton of plaque build up in the upper brackets! This tooth brush should be included with their treatment plan. The only downside I have about this toothbrush, is that we had to buy the braces brush separately, it would amazing to see a braces specific packaging.
"
"
I was anxious about switching to a powered toothbrush as I have extremely sensitive gums that recede if too much pressure is applied in brushing.  This toothbrush is perfect, as there is a sensitivity speed and if you are pressing down to hard a red indication light comes on to tell you.  My teeth feel like they are getting a deeper clean then manual brushing but without the receding gums.  I also like that it buzzes every 30 seconds to tell you when to switch to a new quadrant of the mouth.  Overall very impressed and happy with this product.  Definitely a worthwhile investment!
"
"
This rechargeable electric toothbrush is a very well made and robust product.  I used it on the Sensitive #3 setting, and was very careful to read all the instructions as to the correct angle to deploy it, and at the correct pressure (very little!).  And it does clean my teeth beautifully.  However, I do have large root canals in my back teeth, and I feel the vibration has affected them.  And since losing and replacing them is not a prospect I would look forward to, I have reluctantly decided to forego using this appliance...
"
"
I have the Oral-B 7000 series and I really like it. So, I decided to buy the 5000 for my mom for mother's day and she loves it. I also bought the 5000 for my boyfriend for his birthday. I feel that this electric toothbrush cleans better than the normal toothbrush and really helps into those hard to reach spots. The battery life is pretty good. You can use it several days without charging it. Although there are different modes, none of us use any other modes besides the default one. I used to track my brushing habits by linking the toothbrush to a smartphone app, but I quickly realized that I actually didn't gain much from the information and stopped. The good thing about this model is that it comes with a pressure sensor that turns red if it detects too much pressure. This functionality is very important because my friend's mom who has a lower model without the pressure sensor said it made her teeth sensitive, which I assume is due to pressing too hard. With these electric brushes, you really don't need to put a lot of pressure as a normal toothbrush. However, if you don't want to spend money on the aesthetics and pressure sensor, I would recommend a lower version with less functionality. If you live in the same household, you can actually just buy one toothbrush and use different toothbrush heads, which are detachable.
"
"
Great rechargeable toothbrush. If you have any gum recession your dentist will recommend using an Oral B. This will make bi-annual cleanings less painful too. Minus one star because I never use the smart phone integration -- it's a bit silly if you're a grown-ass woman who has been brushing her teeth since she first got teeth.
"
"
I bought the Oral-B Pro 5000 after trying a Sonicare for a bit after my old Oral-B died after 12years. Sonicare worked ok however my teeth and gums felt better after getting back using an Oral-B again. My choice is Oral-B and I highly recommend this brand.  Oral-B brushes are all good, just depends what all you want in a brush and what extras.
"
"
teeth feel just as clean as when the hygienist cleans them.  I think this was a smart and sensible purchase although the newest one is in Costco for the same price.  Not sure if it would do as good a job????
"
"
After searching and comparing Philips Sonicare tooth brushes to Oral-B...I've realised that either one will work fine and it's just personal preference.I purchased this Pro 5000 unit and it's been great, albeit short battery life compared to the Sonicare, but that's about the only con. I've been satisfied with the purchase so far.This model (Pro 5000) comes WITH the travel case also.  It's not even worth purchasing the black Pro-7000 model as that one is advertised as having a tongue cleaning action and a travel case.  That's not a concern as I got a travel case with mine and I can brush my tongue with my Pro-5000 manually.  Not a deal breaker.
"
"
Im replacing a 10 year old basic Oral B rechargable toothbrush.  This one is so much better.  The only thing that could be improved is the mode settings.  There is no visual indication of which mode it is set to.  However I discovered that you can go to the app and just disable the modes you dont want.  I found that I only wanted 2 of the modes anyway
"
"
Product works well and battery life is great.3 stars for value. I wish I had opted for the lower priced model since I’m never going to change the speed from the fastest or use the blue tooth.
"
"
I like this brush a lot, but constantly am dealing with app syncing and connection issues when brushing. Furthermore, the app doesn't tell you what mode the brush is in. While the Bluetooth is a novelty feature, I was hoping for it to work more consistently.
"
"
I contemplated purchasing a Sonicare brush but as a previous Oral-B owner, I couldn't give this brush up.  It cleans my teeth well, the feels great, love the 5 different settings and the replacement brushes are reasonably prices (relative to the Sonicare brushes).  You can't go wrong with this brush.
"
"
Wow je l'adore , ça décape les dents elle me plaît beaucoup surtout que avant je fesais ça a la main. La connectivité Bluetooth marche super bien
"
"
love the timer that buzzes the brush every 30 seconds, made by brushing habits better. you can save 100$ by not getting the bluetooth version. battery is like 10 days but i charge every night.
"
"
So far so good!  Its an electric toothbrush with lots of features.  It seems a bit overkill to have Bluetooth, but whatever, its a toothbrush!  If you can get it on sale, its a great toothbrush.
"
"
Great brush. Love the pressure semsor, apparently I was brushing waaaayyy too hard!
"
"
For the dd with the perfect teeth who wants to keep them that way.  She loves it!
"
"
This was a replacement for a Oral B that I had for 12 years.  While this one does a good job, the pulsing every 30 seconds and the double pulse to identify 2 minutes are good, but I miss the display in the handle.
"
"
J'utilise les brosses à dents électrique Oral B depuis fort longtemps et celles-ci sont très performantes. Donc celles-ci ne fait pas exception et je vous la suggère fortement.
"
"
It's exactly what I was wanting in a toothbrush. It connects to an app to show you how well you are brushing or if you need to make changes to your brushing habits.
"
"
Surprisingly light. The app is fun the two first time and then useless. We’ll see if the battery last longer than the previous one..
"
"
This is a terrific product to help me do as good a cleaning job on my teeth at home as I possibly can so ,I can spend less time and money at the dentist !!!
"
"
Excellent produit de qualité.  Rend le nettoyage des dents facile et j'aime bien les différents programmes de brossage qu'elle offre.  De plus il est facile de suivre notre utilisation via l'application mobile car cette brosse possède une fonction bluetooth
"
"
Leaves the old pearlies feeling clean and polished cant complain!
"
"
Excellent product, might feel a bit harsh and strong the first time but you'll get used to it right away, does a great job, leaves your mouth feeling super clean.
"
"
Good quality
"
"
great product. use it regularly
"
"
It replaced my old Braun Oral B after many years and I like the faster speed and additional timing sequences. Quite enjoyable to use
"
"
my wife likes it very much
"
"
The battery life is pitiful for a product this expensive. But when it works, it works.
"
"
good product, can connect with mobile app but not convenient enough for use the clock on mobile. Clean and whitening teeth efficiently. Good battery for 3 weeks use. But need 24 hr to charge every time.
"
"
I had an older Oral B power toothbrush (for several years) and noticed that the power had decreased considerably. I was pleasantly surprised by the new brush's power and the app that accompanys it.
"
"
Best value of oral-B electronic toothbrush! I had 1000, 2000 and 3000 over the years, was thinking about jumping to 7000 but 5000's function is really good enough and is much cheaper than 7000!
"
"
Used for a couple days and now went connect to phone... Wont allow for multiple users either.
"
"
Bought four for grandchildren way less cavities now
"
"
Does a MUCH better job than using a manual toothbrush!
"

Returned after 1 monthHandle started showing signs of rust in 1 MONTH!!!
"

Everything you would expect from an Oral B (Braun) Pro toothbrush
"
"
Believable great piece of equipment
"
"
Works great. You do get 1 brush head with the package
"
"
Takes a long time to charge with a very bright blue flashing light. Battery doesn't last as long and there is no warning that it is getting low. I liked my old Sonicare better.
"
"
The tooth brush is light, if fits nicely in  your hand and is very powerful
"

As expected

I received this product free from Oral-B. I'm about half way through the trial now, and let me tell you, it's not just the brush, but the app too. The brush is great, I've stuck with the stock head for now, but will pick up a couple of the other options too.  The toothbrush itself is a standard rechargeable brush, and the battery is rather long lived, I've taken it away without the charging base and it's lasted the entire week. I do find it takes a long time to charge and the blue flashing light is rather bright, it's sort of like a dance party in your powder room. The brush has lights on the back to indicate different phases of brushing, as well as when you're brushing too hard it will display a red light. Great visual reminder.The real incentive for me however is the app. The geek factor of a bluetooth enabled toothbrush just speaks to me. Your brush can sync to the app as you go, or it will store your brushing history. You can select the brushing program (sensitive, whitening, plaque fighter etc). I'm running with the plaque fighter, and have set up extended brushing times to target trouble areas. Additionally the app will prompt you to floss, rinse and brush your tongue, tracking these activities as well if you sync while brushing.  And even cooler, the timer starts and stops based on the sound of your toothbrush!You can also sync a second brush to the app.My dentist has been after me for years to get an electric toothbrush, now I see what all the fuss is about!
"
"
I had always wondered if I would like an electric toothbrush but had never purchased one. I love the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries toothbrush!  My teeth only feel this clean after a visit to the dentist and that usually only lasts about a day. Now I have that reallllyyyy clean feeling at home every day and I think they are even getting whiter (even on the daily clean setting, as I often forget to switch to the whitening setting).It took a couple of days to get used to as I'd never used this type of toothbrush before (pressed a little too hard a few times and had to work at holding it, turning it in my mouth and generally not getting toothpaste everywhere when I inadvertently turned it on OUTSIDE of my mouth. lol), but I'd never go back to a ""manual"" toothbrush now. It vibrates in 30 second intervals to let you know if you are on track for having each quarter of your teeth complete.  I'm hooked!I had to get hubby to give me a hand getting the bluetooth to sync with the app on my phone.  I was turning on the whole toothbrush and not just the WIFI. This can be turned on by pressing the down arrow. I felt that wasn't clearly explained and I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure this piece out. I didn't miss the app though as the toothbrush itself gives you similar feedback, the app is more for the ongoing results I feel. For me, I probably wouldn't pay extra for the bluetooth connectivity.But overall, I love it! Won't be going back to a manual toothbrush anytime soon!I did receive this product for free from Oral-B to test and I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity!

I love the Oral B Smart Series 5000 more than any toothbrush I have ever used! It makes you WANT to brush your teeth over and over again! There is a timer you follow so it's fool proof in making sure you cover all areas of your mouth. It even reminds you to clean your tongue and floss! The only down side is that it has so many features , I'm not sure what all of them are for or if I ever will, but it's a fun toothbrush to use. If you remember to bring it to the washroom; it monitors your use, gives you encouraging messages and reward badges for doing things right. You can also watch a news feed or use other apps at the same time; not sure if I am co-ordinated enough for this but it's cool anyway. There has even been mornings where I am so tired while brushing and the toothbrush itself vibrates like a video game controller so you know its time to switch the section you are brushing! There is a diagram you can look at to actually SEE which area to move to! There is prompts for what to do next, it's like an app or video game for your teeth! Can't say enough good things about this toothbrush , it even feels like a massage for your teeth and tells you when you brush too hard! I'm not really one for bringing my phone in the bathroom ( RULE against it in my house) BUT that doesn't change the fact that with or without your phone; it's the best toothbrush I have ever used! I did receive this free to try from Oral B, but we are now buying them for the whole family!

I received Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries brush from Oral-B free to try.  I'm using it for about 2 months and I'm able to give it full review. Before Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I only used manual tooth brush. The most important qualities I was expecting from Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries were: excellent plaque removal, do not hurt my gums and easy to reach all areas. All smartness and blue tooth technology was an additional bonus. First I installed an Oral-B app, where I typed in my upcoming dental hygienist appointment- yes, it has the calendar build in! I synched Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries to my phone, watched all instructional videos and started using it. The brush was spinning gentle brushing my teeth and cleaning near my gums, where most plague and tartar reside. It went very easy to the very back of my mouth, to clean those never reachable before areas. Brush has a vibration+light indicator-timer splitting time of programmed brushing into 4 eaqual  parts. I was also watching the app, showing the timer as well. Brush also has high pressure indicator. If you press too hard it'll buzz and flash red light. After I finished brushing, the feeling I had in my mouth was like I just had hygienist appointment. Smooth!  App asked me to complete tongue cleaning, flossing and rinsing.The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries has a removable head, storage and travel container. We bought additional head for my husband. The only disadvantage we noticed blue tooth synchronized all mine sessions to his phone. Basically if you don't use the app during brushing, toothbrush will store sessions itself and will synchronize it to the first phone. Since we don't always have our phone while brushing teeth, statistics was a bit  messed up. But it was a minor thing for me. The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries cleans teeth with amazing result, my dental hygienist was very impressed, as I shared my excitement about this new brush.  It was very gentle. Plaque and tartar was removed from the places near my gums. Head is so small, I was able to maneuver it behind my teeth at the back. It will remind to floss, rinse and clean tongue.  The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries has several programs for deep cleaning, massage and polishing your teeth. Training, motivating and improving my brushing habits and technique.Absolutely great brush, 5 stars. I would 100% recommend the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries to anyone.

I was a little hesitant to start using the Oral-B Pro 5000 at first - as I have really sensitive teeth.  My fears were totally unfounded!  I used the gentle setting and the massage setting with no problems!  My teeth feel totally clean and gums too.  I think after a couple of weeks I will be able to use a tougher setting as well.  Love the Bluetooth Connectivity and it is great for keeping tracking of brushing habits - especially for the kids.  Easy to use controls and great battery life.  My Dentist is gonna be wowed on my next Check Up! #GotItFree from #OralB!

I received this Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity toothbrush free from Oral-B through a BzzAgent campaign for my unbiased opinion. This is my first rechargeable toothbrush and I love it.  It gives me a dentist clean feeling after each use! It is easy to set up right out of the box and takes about 12 hours to fully charge. I have used it twice a day for the last week and it still has 3/4 charge. I downloaded the Oral-B app to my phone to try it out and I find it useful - I realized after using it that I wasn't brushing nearly long enough. It also has good reminders to brush your tongue, floss and use mouthwash. The toothbrush vibrates when you are brushing too hard or when it's time to move to another quadrant of teeth to ensure you are brushing all your teeth. I'm definitely a convert and will never go back to my manual brush.

I received this toothbrush as a free trial from oral b.  It makes my teeth feel great! Like I've just been to the dentist.  I do find the bluetooth connectivity a bit odd since I don't bring my phone to the bathroom.  Full strength is a bit brain rattling but you can turn that down and use the sensitive setting. If you do use the app to keep track it's kind of a neat feature.  I've always been a manual brush user but this definitely gets the job done better.
"
"
Recieved the product from BzzAgent.  Fantastic Product.  The app options are endless.  It will send you reminders and challenge for your oral care.  I may take a bit of getting used to if you haven't used a electric toothbrush before, but it makes you feel like you just came back from the dentist, each and every time!!  Fantastic.  Thank you Oral B

I received the Orab-B pro 5000 smart series toothbrush from Oral B so that I could try it and give my opinion.Up until now I’ve only ever used a manual toothbrush and didn’t know why anyone would want an electric one. The fact that this one came with an app not only peaked my curiousity but awoke my inner skeptic as well. Do we really need an app for our tooth brush?The answer is YES! The Oral-B pro 5000 leaves your teeth so clean it actually gives you added confidence in your smile and the fact that your breath is clean and fresh.In a time when we’re all too busy and cut corners everywhere, the Oral-B pro 5000 toohbrush and app is a perfect reminder that we need to slow down and take our oral hygiene seriously.The app is a perfect companion and is almost like having your dental professional with you the whole time. It’s important to note however that the app only tracks one person’s progress.The app contains a bunch of instructional videos which are straight forward and easy to watch. Once you’re ready, launch the app and commence the process.The 1st part is the brushing. A timer comes on and you’ll see a 3D model of set of teeth appear on the screen. One section will be highlighted which is the section you should start with. Depending on the setting and length of time you’ve choose, the handle of the tooth brush will vibrate and flash at the proper intervals so that you know it’s time to move on to the next highlighted section. You keep going until all the brushing is done you’ll get a signal letting you know that you’ve completed the 1st step.Step two is the tongue brushing and step 3 is flossing.  You’ll also have a reminder to use a fluoride rinse. You can skip these steps if you want but the app will track how many times you complete or skip each step.You can also keep track of your dental appointments, add your dentist info and get other tips and tricks.The brush head itself is versatile and pulsates and rotates. You can just hold the brush against your teeth and gums and the work is done for you!For me the bristles are too soft. I prefer a harder brush so I pressed hard when holding it against my gums causing the red light to flash and the app to tell me I was brushing too hard.The size of the brush is small enough that I can easily manoeuvre it to hard to reach places but big enough that I feel it’s actually doing a good job.It’s recommended to change the heads every 3-6months but it’s ok as replacement heads are readily available and not that expensive.The brush itself comes with a price tag but it’s worth it once you realize that your mouth is much fresher and cleaner than it use to be and your dental appointments could end up being shorter and less expensive!I would absolutely recommend the Oral B Pro 5000. It leaves teeth clean and fresh giving you one less things to worry about.There should be an app for everything we do so we’re forced to really examine how we do things! It has forced me to slow down and really look at the way I brush my teeth which has resulted in better oral health for me.

NiMH non replaceable battery.Crap travel case made of cheap plastic.Useless bluetooth function.Not better than the 20$ basic model.Got a Philips instead, with li-ion, nice case, uv cleaning for the same price.
"
"
Awesome.  Thanks!
"
"
The toothbrush itself is great along the gravel case and the standThat being said, the bluetooth is useless the 2nd day of usage because nobody's gonna take it their phone in the bathroom every morning to follow their brushing habitsAnd all the brushing mode is pretty useless too in my opinionI seriously think that if I would be doing a blind test, I couldn't tell the difference between this one and a less expensive toothbrushIf you want the case and the stand, buy it separately and will save yourself tons of money
"
"
My dentist had been nagging me to get an Electric Toothbrush for as long as I can remember because my gums were no longer protecting the root of my teeth - I was putting too much effort brushing up and down.  I finally got this electric toothbrush.  I see now the difference between brushing my teeth with a regular toothbrush versus an electric one.  It won't reverse the damage I did to my gums, but at least it is now under control. Good investment.
"
"
I bought this as an upgrade and replacement of my 8 yr old Oral B electric toothbrush. This toothbrush comes with a neat little covered container for 4 brush heads. There's also a battery indicator to indicate when charged for use.The 1st thing I noticed is the speed, 10x faster. This is great for brushing along the gum line and in between teeth to remove plaque. The blue tooth works but I didn't rate it because I don't use it.  I do like the 5 different settings which provides more options to brushing your teeth.  I recently had a wisdom tooth pulled and the sensitive setting was not too harsh on the healing gums.  I also liked the pro setting which can be used to brush each quadrant of your teeth for 45 secs.  Or, you can set it to go off at the 2 min dentist recommended mark.Overall, a great product and value for the money.

Got the upgrade bug one night and decided to get something new to replace my triumph. 1st, this was a waste of time and I should give my head a shake.. what possible upgrade could a vibrating brush have.. Outside of a slightly longer battery life, zero difference. When buying these, buy the cheapest one.. i'm sure its the same motor in all. You won't use all the modes, you don't need to see which mode it is.. and it is ridiculous oralB charges so much more to have a mode icon on the level above this. They could cut their lineup to 3 brushes.. basic, one that has all features, and the top travel version. And bluetooth is a joke.. whos actually gonna run an app prior to brushing? The exec that came up with this should be fired, but how else would OralB flog an ""upgrade""? And as others have said, the charging light is BRUTAL. First night it was like we had rented a room in a seedy motel next to a flashing neon sign out the window.. closed the door to the bathroom but the door edges would glow on and off.. on and off.. on and off like a scene from Close Encounters of the Third Kind.  Really poorly thought out product. You could tell this was just rushed out with no thought at all to any of it. Cash grab. Stick with your old one.
"
"
Bought this toothbrush for my wife's Christmas gift. When she tried it she immediately loved it She said that she could really feel the difference and that she would not go back to her old manual tooth brush. I also bought the 12 pack of additional brushes that magnificently complements the brush.
"
"
My old electric toothbrush, one of the lower end ones from Oral B, died so I decided to upgrade to this one. It really does the job. My teeth feel super clean after I use it. The features are all really nice, I particularly like the pressure sensor because I guess I never knew I was brushing too hard before. The timer is really handy, it goes off every 30 seconds to indicate to move to a different part of your mouth. Before I was just guessing at timing but this toothbrush makes it extremely easy and foolproof to brush your teeth properly. The bluetooth feature is nice, if you're somebody who likes to keep track of your brushing.I also find that this model is much easier to keep clean than my old one. With the brush head stand attached it gives you a place to put them, so that you are cleaning the entire thing every time.The travel case is indeed cheap plastic but it does the job of a travel case just fine, although I find that the brush heads fall out of their slots really easily, so be careful when you're opening it after travel.I would recommend this toothbrush to somebody who is willing to shell out a bit more in terms of cost for some nice extra features. If you're not interested in the bluetooth or different modes or anything like that, it's probably not worth it. But it was exactly what I was looking for.
"
"
I've being using it for a month and I love it. This is my  first electric brush so there is nothing to compare it to, except regular brushes and battery powered ones, but boy, there is such a difference between battery powered one and electric. This one just have way to much more power and I just can't imagine going back to the old way of brushing my tooth. There is iOS app that you can synch with your phone with Bluetooth and get info how you brush, whether you put too much pressure, the leght of your sessions, also there are personal plans with instructions, like if you  have soar or swollen gums it tells you  how to brush and with which mode (as it has 5 modes of brushing) to help your gums.It has Braun motor, German technology, and those Germans rocks.  I will absolutely recommend it.
"
"
Software nags at me to brush my teeth. Different modes for different goals (whiten, daily, etc) Way better than the old basic $50 oral b. Makes me almost enjoy brushing..only thing I don't appreciate are the ads in the software that encourage me to buy more stuff, but at least its related to mouth care.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned. I had an Oral-B electric brush for over 20 years and it worked fine until my daughter dropped it and cracked the battery.I expect this unit to last as long.I love the Bluetooth feature with the iPhone app... although I forget to use it most days and just resort to brushing normally without the phone. Definitely a recommended product.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush and I am vey pleased with my purchase. I bought this product after I read about it online and how pleased many people were with it. They are right this is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever owned and will probably ever own. It has a host of features that are great such as Bluetooth compatibility so you can connect to a smart phone and track your progress. I find the app to be useful but I can see any people abandoning it down the road. I have stopped using the app myself because I find it more cumbersome than just putting on the brush head and brushing my teeth. It has a bunch of different brushing modes to help you achieve whatever you want. Me personally I just use the daily clean mode and sometimes the deep clean mode depending on how I feel. The toothbrush works very well and my mouth feel super clean after using it. The brush head allows me to maneuver around my mouth and reach those hard to reach places better than an ordinary brush. The visible pressure sensor is great too because sometimes you might not realize that you’re applying more force when maneuvering around to tight spots.  I like the customization that you can have with the toothbrush by switching modes, brush heads and playing with that to find what works best for you. The battery life is fantastic I can go a full 7 days without charging and using twice daily. Charging is super easy just dock it in the wireless charging dock and leave it alone. I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone who wants to have a super clean mouth. The power from this thing is incredible.

Seems to be useful. 5 power modes including Deep Clean to gum massage. The handle lights up if you hold it tightly. The brush will stop if you press too hard on the teeth. The enclosed  manual is easy to read.Took 18 hours to fully charge the battery. Should last for at least two week of brushing twice a day (2 - 3 minutes each session).There is the option of seven different brushes (extra purchase) to clean your teeth. FlossAction, 3D White, Sensitive Gum, Ortho Bush, Deep Sweep, Power Tip.
"
"
Have been using this toothbrush for over one year now. Never had any issue brushing, charging, or connecting with my phone.The product itself is dependable and convenient to use; however, the Oral-B app is not well-designed to match their great products.
"
"
I have used an Oral B electric toothbrush for many years but finally decided to retire my previous brush and am I ever glad I did.  The new brush is easier to hold, has multi-settings and looks much nicer.  Charging stand is a huge improvement over the old one as well and like that it came with a carrying case. Love the black!  Feel like it does a much better job of cleaning than the old brush did.  Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
You can go for the cheaper versions as the Bluetooth/App functions while interesting really are not something the average person has time for.  The tooth brush works great but I can't imagine the avg person using the App and Bluetooth functions regularly.  Very fast delivery
"
"
I mostly use just the regular ""daily clean"" mode and it keeps my teeth white and super clean all day! I always used to use a manual toothbrush and white strips and then I decided to give an electric toothbrush a try because my boyfriend said they were so much better. I can see where he's coming from because the clean feeling after you brush your teeth is like when you come out of the dentist. I love it! And I bought this version for the ""whitening "" mode so that I wouldn't have to buy white strips anymore and I am SO glad I did! Even just the ""daily clean "" mode whitens and then the actual ""whitening"" mode increases that! I would recommend this to everyone!!
"
"
I was disappointed in this toothbrush. It lost its charge after the first 5 days. I wish there was a pressure sensor on the toothbrush itself and a way to tell what mode it is in without using the app. It cleans fine but should have bought one without the Bluetooth features. I don’t really want to bring my phone into the bathroom everytime I brush my teeth.
"
"
So far I love this toothbrush. Didn't think much of the BlueTooth connection at first, but after a week, I have found myself using the app more. I can look at calendar events and weather and news while I'm brushing my teeth.
"
"
The toothbrush works great, but the app is my favourite part. You can add pre set programs to help with your dental hygiene goals. You can also tailor your own program with the assistance of your dental hygienist. It had a built in timer which buzzes when it’s time to change sections of your mouth. I have nothing bad to say about this toothbrush
"
"
This is a toothbrush.I can be used to brush your teeth.The reason I gave this 3/5 is because it's too noisy IMO. My partner has one that only emits a slight humming sound, I plan to get rid of this one and buy one of those instead.
"
"
This toothbrush is awesome. I'm a first time electric toothbrush user. My teeth feels like I just had a cleaning at the dentist. I'm starting to have more staining problem from coffee, cigarette and wine. Seems to stain faster than it used too. Well with this toothbrush it really reduces that.
"
"
Worth every penny! Picked up this badboy during amazon prime day and it has done wonders for my oral hygiene in a matter of weeks. I also bought a waterpik (water flosser) to create a daily routine. Check out my review there! If you’re someone who currently does not have dental coverage, buy both of these items and you’ll be set!
"
"
Great product. Came quickly and in good condition. Various settings allow for a cleaner mouth feel. One thing I would criticized is the fact that the app is not compatible with Android phones, which seems to be an ongoing issue.
"
"
Works perfect giving an excellent brush.  Excellent product.  Most will not use all the feature rich modes but if you are looking for an all around excellent electric tooth brush, this one will do the trick.
"
"
Not that I needed a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush but it was on sale. Problem is I rarely take my phone with me into the bathroom where I brush my teeth and therefore never activate the app. I also generally leave it on the same speed so the other 4 speeds while nice to have are rarely used.
"
"
This Oral B 5000 really does a good job on your teeth.  The bluetooth capabilty is very much dependent on your phones ability to be able to handle Bluetooth 4.0 or higher.  My phone could not handle it and my tablet wasn't capable of being updated to newer software.  I did get in touch with Oral B, explained the problem and they kindly sent me one of their Smartguides.  This works with the bluetooth of the brush and you are able to use it the same way as you would the downloaded app.  Kudos to Oral B and P&G for having super customer service reps.
"
"
Brushes really well but the battery in ours is faulty, it never shows a full charge, usually only 1of3, no good for Travel because it doesn't hold enough charge. We can only use it 3 times per day or the battery dies, even though it says you can use it 10 times between charges.
"
"
Replaced an older oralB which did not hold a charge and slowed down.  I didn't know how much so until this new unit.  A negative would be the almost useless Bluetooth feature and the needlessly bright blue LEDs which unintentionally act as a night light in the bathroom.
"
"
I do not understand the point of adding Bluetooth functionality if the app itself doesn’t write to HealthKit. Such a tragic and grotesque waste for a product with so much potential. I’ll be returning this overpriced toothbrush promptly.
"
"
It was time to replace my 10 year old Oral-B Vitality and I'm amazed how much better this product is. The head oscillates so much faster and makes your teeth feel truly clean. I can't say much about all the gimicks like the bluetooth app, which might be interesting, but not really needed. All I want is a tooth brush that does its job and that it does. Very happy!
"
"
Je regrette le fait qu’il faut allumer l’application Bluetooth, pour voir le minuteur. Si vous n’allumez pas, ça ne prends pas en compte vos « objectifs »L’appli se veut ludique mais je ne m’en sert jamais.Brosse à dent et batterie parfait
"
"
I've had Oral B products before, but this model has a very useful red light indicator that shows when the brush is pushed too hard against the teeth and, what is even more important, the gums. There is a choice of not too overpriced brushes for different needs. However, the claim that one charge last for about a week is not true. It needs to be recharged every every 4 to 5 days.
"
"
Love this toothbrush! It leaves my teeth feeling just-been-to-the-dentist clean, and the app is so much cooler and useful than you might think. I scoffed at it at first, but now I think it's great!
"
"
J'aime vraiment beaucoup, le seul hic est l'application bluetooth que je trouve un peu lourde à utiliser mais pour le brossage des dents c'est vraiment parfait
"
"
Brush does a very nice job,quiet also. The only thing I don't like is that I have to have my phone with me to get the alarm stating that I brushed enough.
"
"
A great electric toothbrush that comes with an upgraded lithium ion battery, a travel case and a charging station. My dentist recommended Oral B as a replacement for my old electric toothbrush. I agree, and highly recommend this model electric brush.
"
"
I figured the bluetooth would be a waste of money, I was right. However I like the toothbrush, wireless charging is nice.  The pressure sensor works well.
"
"
It look the same in the pic with good quality
"
"
This product works well. Does a much better cleaning job than a regular toothbrush.
"
"
Great improvement over Oral B Vitality. The app is a total waste of time.
"
"
The product comes as advertised and does the job better than any manual or cheap vibrating toothbrush. The battery life lasts about 2 weeks with twice daily usage.
"
"
This was my first electric toothbrush so I have nothing to compare it to, but I do love it. Just wish it charged faster.
"
"
Love my new Oral-B it’s a must have for your brushing needs there is honestly no better toothbrush out there right now
"
"
love the new toothbrush feels great to use takes a while to charge though and mine came a little dinged up
"
"
Le produit rempli plus que mes attentes. Solide pratique, qualité supérieure et quelle travail il fait pour mes dents. Je le recommande fortement.
"
"

"
"
Bought one for my wife and other family members as it was the best toothbrush I’ve used.
"
"
very pleased with my electric tooth brush.  I have to turn it down as it is very powerfull.  Also do not push too hard.  Have taken it on 4 day trips without charger and it worked very well.  Bought some more brushes and now my wife is using it.
"
"
My Oral-b pro 5000 only lasted 3 months and when we contacted the company there was no response
"
"
Charger not working and Braun cannot replace it free, you need to buy it from them and pay shipping cost. Not a great warranty.
"
"
Although it discharges sometimes when it shouldn't it seems to work well.
"
"
The product was exactly as advertised. It was reasonably priced and arrived one day earlier than expected.
"
"
Had the older model and still use it, was manually brushing before this brush is a game changer. Dental cleaning time majorly reduced.
"
"
Fabulous for what it’s designed for - cleaning teath
"
"
The product was easy to use and it has 5 modes which helps us brush more effectively. Would definitely recommend
"
"
Really good. I don't think I will use the smart aspect, but the unit works very well.
"
"
Got it on black friday for sale and it's a really good toothbrush.
"
"
Va très  bien
"
"
I've been using same one but it was broken...However, I bought it again because of a great electric tooth brush!
"
"
Love it. Great price!
"
"
Very simple, easy to use toothbrush. Better yet than the previous model which I have had for 10 years.
"
"
Super
"
"
Works good

If you're happy to be nagged by your toothbrush, then buy this one. It connects by bluetooth to an app in your cell phone, so you'll  need to take your phone or tablet into the bathroom with you. I'd hoped it might connect to the timer gizmo of my previous Oral B Smart toothbrush which had finally died after four or five years, but it wasn't able to.The phone app measures the duration of your cleaning, the average time spent cleaning your teeth, the pressure applied and then encourages you to clean your tongue and use a mouthwash. I gave up caring after a few days.However, without the testimony of my dentist I suspect this is an excellent toothbrush. It certainly feels as if it's going a good job and is robust and powerful. My one small quibble is the brightness of the charging light. We have a frosted glass door on our en suite and the charging toothbrush throws a ghostly blue glow into the bedroom!
"

Oral B pro 5000 smart series. The first brushing, it may seem loud & feel almost too powerful, but by the 2nd, brushing there is no problem. It will make your teeth feel much cleaner. I like the timer as I brush longer. The pressure sensor does work; there will be a  red light. If the blue lights are on when you feel you have bushed long enough, click on the arrow to turn it off, or the battery will drain.The first 1 we purchased was from a local pharmacy, & cost us  almost $80.00 more than when purchased from Amazon; so do your price comparison. Do buy this toothbrush.... happy smiling.
"
"
First, it is too noisy and second, when using the brush itself you never know what mode is on unless you connect it to your cellphone. When you start the brush, it always starts in the same mode and you need to memorize the five modes if your cellphone is not around. The battery does not last too much when not in the charger ( no more than 2 uses)
"
"
It feels to stiff, and I was disappointed that the kit only comes with one  toothbrush but I have to say it does work, it does a good job
"

So I'm about as skeptical as one can get when it comes to electric toothbrushes. My Dentist is always nagging me about my dislike for them and my love for my good old manual toothbrush. I mean, what can this thing do that my trusty manual can't? My arm has good power. I'm a good brusher. I follow the technique the dentist gave me! But I was so wrong, so very very wrong. The Oral B Smart Series 5000 Toothbrush with bluetooth is AWESOME. First of all, it has power. This is not some wimpy battery operated model. It really feels like a dentist polishing when I use the ""deep clean"" setting. Second, let's talk about those settings. Five. You have five settings to choose from! They all work a little differently, some go for a bit longer than two minutes. There's a whitening setting, deep cleaning and so on. Next,  let's talk about the brush itself. You can get different models but the one that came with it is round, as shown. I think this shape and size is what really helps get into all those crevices and little spots behind your molars. I mean, when I did the tongue swipe, I've never felt my teeth so clean except after a dentist cleaning!Then there's the fact that it comes with a travel case. That's a nice feature because how else are you going to pack it and keep it sanitary? Really glad they thought of that and included it, nice touch. The little case to store your brush heads (for families who share the motor part, I guess?) is nice too. Keeps it clean and fresh for your next use.The Bluetooth feature is where this loses a star for me. It's a great idea but I found the app that goes with it a little picky. If you keep your bluetooth on constantly, this probably won't be an issue for you but it was for me since I turn bluetooth off when I'm not using it. So because I turn it off, I have to ""sync"" the brush when I turn on the bluetooth the next time. The app says how to do it and that does work but I've found it doesn't always catch every brushing that's happened since it's last sync. As of right now, my app told me I've missed 10 brushings which I assure you, I haven't! I also don't like that when you set up the app, it asks for a TON of permissions. It shouldn't need access to my camera or my picture album. The good news is that once you install the app you can go in and turn the access to things like that off and keep it basic if you prefer.Okay so that negative aside (and it's really minor!), this brush really does do a great job. Another feature is that it buzzes when it's time to move from one quadrant to the next while brushing, so you don't lose track of how long to brush! It also has a red light that glows if you're using too much pressure when brushing, which is good because sometimes I get a little enthusiastic. It's important not to go too hard because of your enamel!So overall, 4/5. It delivers on performance and results. Great motor, great charging station and storage. Just a little bit of tweaking is needed in the app and I'm sure that'll come with an update eventually.Please note that I received this product for free for testing through BzzAgent.

I actually bought this item with my own  money. Trust my review and not one from someone who received it for free. This was my first time trying out an electric toothbrush. I had expectations and hopes that my teeth would feel fresh from the dentist clean. This was not the case. It does the same quality of job as a regular toothbrush. It's a great toothbrush but a regular $2 toothbrush does the same job in my opinion.

*Received product for free from Oral-B*I'm coming from the battery operated Oral-B Pulsar Pro-Health Toothbrush to the Oral-B Pro 5000.  I regularly go to my dentist and have not have any significant dental problems.  I thought I was brushing and flossing alright and according to my dentist, I have.  My pulsar was doing its job.  However, moving to the Pro 5000, I think made my teeth cleaner.At first the Pro 5000, made my gums bleed.  I guess the cleaning head I received was too hard but I kept on using it and until my teeth and gums got used to it.  I'm still getting used to the 2 minute timer built in but as I progress, it became a non issue.  Using the Pro 5000 is like having your dental hygienist brushing your teeth for you.  It's where you hate it at first and eventually settling in and loving it.Overall, I would definite recommend the product.  But I wish  I was given the opportunity to try the other cleaning heads to fully see what this product is capable of.Pros:Packing looks nice and clean.Different ModesBluetooth ConnectivityDifferent Brush HeadsTeeth Feels CleanerTeeth look whiterConsThe brush head I received was a little bit too hard to my gums at first.  And I wish I could get the different brush heads to review.Wish it came with the Smart Guide

The toothbrush is great it clean really well and the connection to the app on your phone will make it easy to track your activity. I have this toothbrush for over 9 months now. Fully charging your toothbrush will last you 5-7 days. I didn't have the battery issue other reviews talked about, but because I fully charge the toothbrush and then disconnect the charger and use the battery (I guess that's what keep my battery in shape). I haven't tried the Sonicare though to be able to compare both of them (I know most people are confused between both), but it does the job
"
"
To start, I should mention that I was lucky enough to receive this Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity toothbrush free from Oral-B through a BzzAgent campaign. This is my first electric toothbrush and I love it. If you asked me a few weeks ago if I would have purchased an electric toothbrush, I would have probably said no. But after using this toothbrush for a week now, I have to be honest and say that I don’t think I can ever go back to a manual brush!This toothbrush gives me a dentist clean feeling after each use and is simple to use.  I charged it overnight after taking it out of the box and it was good to go the next morning.  I have used it twice a day for the last week and it still has at least half the charge.After downloading the Oral-B app, I was surprised to find out that I wasn't brushing nearly long enough. The toothbrush vibrates when you are brushing too hard or when it's time to move to another quadrant of teeth to ensure you are brushing all your teeth. The App is easy to set up and easy to select a program to follow.
"
"
I think I truly like the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth connectivity.I received it free from Oral B to try out and am totally appreciative that I did!When I first used the toothbrush I wasn't convinced that I was going to like it. The vibrations were a bit intense and I don't mind visiting the Dentist for a good cleaning but that only happens twice a year. Having my teeth cleaned with the vibrations everyday took some getting used to. Once I did, I could never go back to a regular toothbrush!Absolute bonus that I can connect to the Oral-B app and time my brushing and collect trophies! Love the trophies! Makes me feel like a kid again!I've always thought I brushed long enough and didn't apply too much pressure. I've learned otherwise and am grateful for the knowledge. Always been a freak about clean teeth and the fact that the toothbrush and app made me aware that I was applying too much pressure at times was a welcome tool. You brush too fast, the toothbrush hesitates until you release pressure.If you want a clean, fresh feeling set of teeth, this tooth brush is the perfect choice!

Thanks to Oral B, I have received this Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series Electric Brush for free to try. What a surprise this is! I was always a manual brush type of person. I have an electric toothbrush when I was a child and did not like it at all. I probably used a couple of times and thought the manual way is better for me. Until I tried this Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series with Bluetooth. This is the most amazing toothbrush ever, it has blown me by surprise how clean my teeth are. It seriously feels like I have just got my teeth cleaned from the dentist after using this toothbrush.I'm also a gadget type of person and this is my new and coolest gadget. It is not only easy to sync to the app on my phone, it literally tells you everything on how you should be brushing. The app also keeps track of your progress, in weeks and months. This is not just any electric toothbrush, I think this is the new generation of of brushing. This is seriously my new obsession  and never thought I would love brushing my teeth so much. The Oral B Smart Series makes it so much fun! I strongly recommend this product and should definitely try it out if you want sparkling clean healthy teeth.

I LOVE how clean my teeth feel. I was previously using a manual toothbrush and I always assumed I was doing a pretty good job, until I got this. The brush connects to an app on your phone which allows you to see how well you are brushing your teeth, makes sure you are brushing for two minutes, shows which quadrant of your mouth you should be brushing and reminds you to floss. The app also can connect to the local news and weather so that you can check it out while you brush. This is pretty amazing, everyone likes to be graded, but the toothbrush is great on it's own. It rumbles every 30 seconds to remind you to switch your brushing area and flashes red when you are pressing too hard. I have learned that I have been pressing way too hard when brushing my teeth and probably not regularly reaching the 2 minute mark. This brush helps me to take my time brushing my teeth and makes my teeth feel like I just left the dentist. I can't wait to try some of the other brush heads, although the one that came with the package is excellent. The brush takes a while to charge, but once it is ready, it will stay charged for several days, which is amazing. It comes with a travel case as well which would allow you to go away from home for a few days without lugging along a charger. Perfect for people who travel out of town for business (like me!!!). I received this product for free from Oral-B for my honest review.

I received the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity from Bzz Agent to test and review. This is not my very first electric toothbrush however it has been awhile since I have used one.You're getting 5 brush modes, a vibration and light-flash pattern every 25% into the cycle and the immensely satisfying finish that the brush head provides. While brushing your teeth and spend too much time in one area, the brush wakes you up with bursts of slowing vibrating pulses and a gentle yellowish light to let you know to move on. If you are not gentle enough with the placement of the brush, it will glow red and slow down the pulsations. The toothbrush trains you, to brush properly. I like that you can switch brush heads to share with others that it came with a charger and a case. My teeth are cleaner than they’ve been in a while. This is a multi-functioning toothbrush, but has no indicator for what mode you are in, too bad the app does not indicate this. The app is useless if you plan on sharing the brush with the family will only track one person.Over all I would highly recommend this Oral B brush my dentist sees an improvement which is really what counts.

First off, thank you Oral-B (Braun) forgiving me this awesome Bluetooth toothbrush to trial!! Prior to purchasing one of these Bluetooth connected toothbrushes I would read some reviews, but after trying it.....I'm sold! The Oral-B Pro 5000 with Bluetooth is an amazing product. It holds a charge for almost two weeks brushing twice a day for 3 minutes each time, you can get separate brush heads for everyone in the family, monitor your kids brushing habits, not to mention it really cleans your teeth well.....it gets around behind your back molars with ease and has 5 different brush settings. I will continue to use the Oral-B Pro 5000 from now on, it is truly incredible!! Great product Braun!

I received this product as part of a promotional campaign by the manufacturer. I owned toothbrushes like this before but the fact that it was bluetooth enabled was kinda intriguing.As soon as I used it the first time, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use the app on the phone. There was no need to connect the brush with bluetooth first. The Oral-B app found it right away and I was ready within minutes. The app also shows the progress of your brushing as well as if you are brushing too hard. I was very pleased to see that after I was done, it reminded me to brush my tongue, floss and use mouthwash. At each step, you have to acknowledge it is completed. If you put the app on an iPad, it also displays news information to keep you distracted which is a bonus.Overall, I found the whole experience very pleasant. It keeps me in check and sends me reminders that I need to brush with app notifications. I highly recommend this product to anyone, especially to technology driven individuals that like the thrill of a smart toothbrush.

I recently received an Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries toothbrush. I generally brush my teeth twice a day and use a mouthwash as well to help kill additional germs. I always figured my manual brushing was doing a decent job until I tried this electric toothbrush. I was surprised at truly how well it gets into the spaces between your teeth and how clean your mouth feels by the time you are done. There is a significant difference in how my teeth feel. It's not often you find a product that lives up to the hype of providing a superior cleaning. The only downfall I have with the toothbrush and it's an issue with me, I still have all 4 wisdom teeth so the motor does have to work a bit when I try to get to the very back due to the lack of space, where I can force a manual toothbrush back there and not think twice.Charging the toothbrush does take a while for the first time. We live in an older house that is lacking a plug in the bathroom so I tend to use the toothbrush for multiple sessions before charging again and I can get over a week on a single charge. I have connected the bluetooth up on a Samsung core phone without any problem but I tend not to use it. The toothbrush sends a pulse through the brushing head and flashes a light when it's time to move on to the next section. The app does remind you to floss and use mouthwash but I just don't see myself using it in the long run.I would definitely recommend this product for everyone.This product was received from Oral-B for testing and review.

I recieved the oral b smart series 5000 power toothbrush from OralB to try for free.I have to say that this tooth brush is amazing .Itcleans like going to the dental hygienist every day.You can choose different brush setting for different goals from whitening to braces care to gum health.My teeth felt so clean from the first use .It was so much better than my manual or my battery power toothbrush in terms of cleaning.I choose a whitening program to test the brush and I feel there is a visible difference and the give the tools on your phone to measure the difference in the whitening of your teeth.The instructions state let the brush do the work and it is true all you have to do is move it from tooth to tooth.The blue tooth was fun and was helpful to keep track of when you brush but the timer and vibrations to switch areas were useful as well.

I received the Oral B Pro 5000 Smart Series Electric Power Toothbrush With Bluetooth to use and review from Oral B.  I have to say I was a little skeptical at first.  I was a manual kind of toothbrush person.  Now converted.  The app was easy to install on my phone and the setup process was super quick.  Just a few clicks and it was done.  It has several oral care journeys.  I chose the whitening one.  Who doesn't want a dazzling smile?  After a couple of weeks of using the whitening mode, I have to say to my surprise it actually worked!  my teeth are noticeably whiter!! The screen shows you which quadrant of your mouth your should be brushing in, then vibrates when you need to switch areas.  The handle of the toothbrush will flash red when you are brushing too hard.  It was easy to reach my back teeth as well.  It truly does give you the smooth fresh from the dentist feel.  With the app you also lock different brushing achievements. I thought that this would be fun so I let my 3 year old try the toothbrush too.  He hates brushing his teeth but thought this was great fun and loved watching the timer and all the bells and whistles that come with the app.  I had to get his his own brush head so he would stop using mine.  I really do like the app and the toothbrush but I just can't figure out how to set an oral care journey for each person.  I also wish it would give you second to two between each quadrant of brushing to have time to spit.  All in a great toothbrush.  Fun app with achievements to unlock.  Kiddo approved. Really does give you smooth clean fresh from the dentist feel.

2 weeks ago I Oral B sent me this toothbrush for free.  I am absolutely love it,  thank you thank you.  I tenderly call it my new addiction.  I am addicted to the ""clean feeling"" my teeth feel each and every time i brush.  I love how the head glows red and stops when press the brush hard against my teeth. but what does the green mean?  incredible.  But wait there is more.  The very first time I used it it made crunching sounds.  when i was finished i realized that it had removed plaque that was built up between my teeth.  WOW!!!! Holy Clean Oral B.  I only thought my teeth would be this clean leaving the dentist office.  Nope, this clean at home.  I am loving the portability of it too.  I recently went away over night and the head and handle fit very neatly in the travel case provided by Oral B.  Oral B thought of every thing.  An app to track the brushing progress, sadly i am a blackberry user so can not access the app. :( , a charger, free head, free travel case and a storage compartment for the extra heads.  I strongly recommend this toothbrush, and I bet that once you try it you will say "" I am NEVER using a manual brush again"" just like I did yesterday.

I would like to thank Oral-B for giving me the opportunity to try their product for free.I have been using this product for 3 days now and i fell in love with it , with its 5 brushing modes,  you can choose whatever mode suits you , it feels like i just came out in the dentist office, feels like i had an oral prophylaxis at home ,the bristles are soft and does the work really well,you dont have to sweat as you do with your  manual toothbrush, feels good with just one click of the button , another thing that impresses me is that it has a bluetooth connectivity and apps which is so user friendly , not only that i am sure i am doing it the proper way it also tells you how to do it the right way,with the guide on your Oral-B app, the timer, the pressure sensor as it changes colors .Not to mention you can also read the news updates and the weather while brushing ,what a fun way to brush your teeth , now i am sure i won't get bored while brushing with this feature. I will surely buy extra brush heads for the entire family as it comes with the brush head compartment. My teens can't wait to try it .I will proudly recommend this product to my friends and family .

I had actually been researching various brands of electric toothbrushes and trying to decide which one to purchase for my family, so I was thrilled when I received an invitation to review the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity. I received this product for free from Oral-B in exchange for an honest review.At first glance, it appears to be simple enough to use, there's an obvious power button and then another button with a ""V"" that you press to change to the different modes. I've read that there are 5 different modes (daily clean, gum care, sensitive, whitening, and deep clean), but to be honest, I have a hard time differentiating which mode I'm in after pressing the button a few times, because there is nothing to indicate which is which. I know that the toothbrush head spins more furiously and in different directions for certain modes, but I know that as soon as I turn the brush on, it's at the daily clean mode and that is generally fine for my needs. If you are really particular about being on a particular setting, then this might be a sticking point for you, but this doesn't really change anything for me.I also had some difficulty pairing my phone (and I have a Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge) to the toothbrush at first because the bluetooth pairing kept asking for a pincode.  There was no pincode to enter, so I guessed 0000 and 1111, the usual standards.  Nothing worked. When I was getting out of the app, thinking that it wasn't working, the app somehow indicated that my phone was successfully paired to the toothbrush. Even with a bit of a bumpy start with the set up, don't get me wrong--I absolutely LOVE this toothbrush. I don't bring my phone into the bathroom with me every time I brush my teeth because I think it's too much of a hassle (and I don't want to get my phone wet by accident), but I have brought it in to use the app and like that the app really helps to keep track of which section of your teeth you should be brushing and helps time you. You can also keep track of whether you've brushed your tongue, flossed, used mouthwash, etc. so it's very thorough.Something that I wish someone had told me from the start was to NEVER turn on the toothbrush (when you have toothpaste on it) before you put it in your mouth! I did that the first time and got toothpaste literally everywhere! Haha! I guess you live and learn! So always have the toothpaste on the brush and in your mouth before you start it.I absolutely love, love, love how clean my teeth feel--it's like that ""just been to the dentist"" kind of clean, and I never felt this way after using my manual toothbrush. In fact, I loved this toothbrush so much after using it a few times that I went out an bought additional toothbrush heads for the whole family (my hubby and two kids).  It's super easy to switch out the toothbrush heads that are colour-coded, and I just make sure they rinse out the toothbrush head before putting it in the little slots on the toothbrush holder. So simple that even my four-year old can use it, and there's a red indicator light that comes on the toothbrush handle when you're brushing too hard! They all love this toothbrush as much as I do! I honestly don't know how we lived without this toothbrush!

First off I would like to thank Oral B for the opportunity to try this product as part of a promotion.I think if you asked me a few weeks ago if I would purchase an electric toothbrush. It was at best a maybe. One with BLUETOOTH. I would have laughed at you... but after only using it 3 days. Hands down it would be YES!!I am surprised to discover I have been brushing my teeth wrong all these years and not nearly long enough. I cannot get over how I have that just left the dentist feeling with this brush.I love the Bluetooth feature that coaches me. I discovered I have been brushing WAY too hard. The App is easy to set up and it is easy to select a program to follow. I am following Gum Health.I have only one small hick up and that was pairing it with my cell. It took a few tries to be successful but I think that was the user. OoopsI will never give this up even though my son was eyeing it the other night.

I was given the chance to try the Oral B Smart Series 5000 electric brush last week as part of a promotion from the brand and so far so good. I am amazed by the clean feeling it gives me after each time I use it. My teeth feel as clean as if I just stepped out of the dentist.I've also installed the app on my phone that connect to the Bluetooth of the brush itself allowing me to track my brushing stats and telling me if I have brushed too hard or not long enough. I believe that it will definitely have a big impact on my next dentist's appointment. I would definitely recommend it.
"

I bought this for my husband during Prime Day and he absolutely loves it! He doesn't play with the app all that much, but he loves how clean his teeth feel. He says that it feels like he just came from the hygienist!

Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth was the best way to protect your teeth and gums... I have had major bleeding with my gumsthen after trying My Oral-B Pro my bleeding was gone... I really liked the pressure sensor and it had polished feeling of my teeth after brushing.I will give five stars because it does work great and my teeth feels really good after brushing!The bluetooth thing is amazing because you can keep track of your progress and see how good you brush your teeth..Everyone should have this very smart brush! Worth buying!

I was given this brush from Oral B as part of a promotion. I have never used an electric tooth brush before. Boy have I been missing out! I love this brush! It cleans my teeth so well, it feels like I just came from the dentist. It has a nice small head so it's easy to reach the back teeth. I like that it has Bluetooth, the app is very easy to use. I can set up to make sure I brush parts that the dentist says I've been missing.I don't think I'll ever go back to a manual brush again! Thanks Oral B!

The toothbrush can save a lot of session before syncing, which is useful. Very powerful yet doesnt hurt. Charger is slow but doesnt bother me.The app is OK.

The battery were dead after using it for three years. I was trying to replace the battery by learning from YouTube, and it's impossible as I don't have those tools to 'glue' the new battery nor to know where to buy the new battery.
"

18 months of daily use by two of us, and this thing is still a beast.  Charges fast, solid feel, all the lights still work including the warning red that I'm brushing too hard.  Love this brush.
"

Came as expected. sealed new box. product is a gift. But I do know from experience that oral b electric toothbrushes are a great product. Ive had my oral b 9000 for about 10 years now. Never had a problem with it. The battery was full charged 3 days ago and ive been using it at least twice a day, It still has 50% left for a charge.

excellent product

La fonction bluetooth est vraiment gadget on s'en sert 5/6 fois au debut puis elle passe vite a la trappe.Pour le reste les fonctions intégrés à la brosse à dents sont vraiment pas mal et pousse à respecter le temps de brossage.

So in love with this product, love the fact that there are so many different brushes that can go on it, as well as the fact that it keeps track of my brushing , so happy that bzzagent sent me a sample to try and everyone should get one

The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries rechargeable toothbrush did deliver an ultimate clean, as promised.  There are 5 modes to chose from: Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening, and Deep Clean. I received the product for free from Oral-B for review, and have been using the toothbrush for around 3 weeks on the""whitening"" setting. Here's what I found....-there is an in handle timer that pulses every 30 seconds to let you know when to switch brushing areas (clean each quadrant for 30 seconds). love that i know how long i have been brushing.-if you brush with too much pressure the handle of the toothbrush will indicate so by lighting up red. Also very helpful.-There is an Oral B app to download on your smartphone and through bluetooth connectivity you are given real time feedback: visuals to show you which quadrant to brush and an indication of when you use too much pressure. To me this seemed redundant as the toothbrush gives you this information anyway. Also, I only remembered to bring the phone with me to the bathroom a couple of times.- A number of brushing sessions are recorded even if you do not have your phone with you. The next time you connect with Bluetooth the data is transferred in case you are interested in looking back at your brushing habits. I was not very interested in my brushing history.- The app will  reward you  for good brushing habits by presenting little ""trophies"". Im not sure if others enjoy this infantilization or needs incentive to maintain good oral hygiene, but I don't.  I find it weird.Overall, I love the clean that this toothbrush delivered. My mouth feels cleaner and healthier compared to when I used a manual toothbrush.I think the Bluetooth connectivity is a useless extra that is used just to sell another new product. This wasn't  invented out of need and I would not pay more for this feature.

Love my NEW Oral - B Pro 5000 bluetooth toothbrush. Glad I purchased on Amazon Prime day.
"
"
received this item as a tester from BZZAgent to try out. Great packaging, Great brand name, Great offer. Oral B has made this toothbrush with me in mind. It does reach a few areas that are difficult with an ordinary toothbrush. Very compact and an attractive unit. My only complaint is the bluetooth. Unless you have a habit of taking your cellphone to the bathroom I found this feature useless.
"
"
I was very excited to receive this product to test as a BzzAgent representative.  I couldn't wait to get it fully charged and into my mouth! I found that the toothbrush took a great deal of time to charge the first time and the runway of lights on the handle was distracting and annoying in the nighttime (especially when I wake up in the middle of the night and make my way to the restroom). The first time I used the Oral B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity I was was very disappointed! It felt like a jackhammer going off in my mouth! I tried to adjust the settings but had no success in changing how the toothbrush felt in my mouth. And for my efforts, I got toothpaste all over the place as it is very difficult to change settings while it is in your mouth! I thought that I must have been doing something wrong so I read the manual (when all else fails, read the instructions...lol) however; it turned out that I was not doing anything wrong. I tried the brush again the following day with the same results. I haven't tried to master the Bluetooth Connectivity as I was so unhappy with the toothbrush, I haven't used it again. The toothbrush cleaned my teeth well the two times that I used it which is why I have given this a two star rating. There is a possibility that the Oral B Pro 5000 that I received is defective but I have no way of knowing that. I do know that I cannot stand the jackhammer effect in my mouth when I used the toothbrush so I will not be using it again, unfortunately. Given my experience, I cannot recommend this product to my family and friends.

received the product for free from Oral-BIt's a great tooth brush works perfectly but i find that the blue tooth is something that i don't use

A good buy if bought for less than $90 on sale. Bluetooth is a USELESS battery drain but can be turned off. This model is MODESTLY better than the Professional 1000 I bought 10 YEARS AGO. My understanding is that any model below the Pro 5000 has a DOWNSIZED BATTERY (only 2/3 the size of my old Pro 1000) resulting in the need to recharge 1.5 times more often and a lifespan only 2/3 as long, and the need to buy a new brush if you are unwilling to perform the necessary ""brain surgery"" needed to replace the battery. IT IS A HUGE MISTAKE to buy any model with the downsized battery, so astute shopping dictates the need to buy a Pro 5000 or higher, if it can be bought a a BIG DISCOUNT. This model is a BAD BUY if bought at the REGULAR PRICE.
"
"
Works just fine, but honestly can't tell the difference from other models for half the price. The Bluetooth feature is pretty much a gimmick. IF you want your usage recorded, you have to pretty much have your phone out each time you brush. It'll store sessions from the past, but honestly how often are you brushing your teeth with your phone out in the bathroom?

This model was a replacement for an older Oral-B brush with a failing battery (the battery cannot be replaced). The package consists of the brush, charger/brush head holder, travel case, a regular brush head and instruction manual; the manual lists four models of this brush so it has to be read to determine which features apply to this model : PRO 5000, in my case. The set up was straightforward and it does take the full 24 hours mentioned in the manual to charge the brush. The travel case holds the brush and two brush heads but not the charger. I use a sensitive brush head and it is easy to replace. It is supposed to remember which brushing mode you use (there are five of them), however, I was never able to get it to remember the Sensitive mode. The brush will warn you if you put excessive pressure on your gums. There are very good written and illustrated instructions on using the brush properly; in many years of using these power brushes, I have learned that letting the brush doing the work and just guiding it according to the recommended techniques is the best method. The specifications state a 10-day charge before recharging; with using it about 5 minutes total per day, it lasted one week before needing recharging. This model pairs with the Oral-B Bluetooth app (Android, in my case). Pairing was quick and a full range of features and customization is available to track brushing time, performance, etc., temperature, weather forecast, as well as a news feed that can be customized to 'watch while you brush'. However, from time to time, connectivity with the app was lost and the tracking was skewed as a result. When I signed up for an 8-week gum health program, the app changed my temperature settings to Fahrenheit and stopped recording the full range of dental hygiene I follow - strange. For full functionality, sign up for an Oral-B account. You can choose to have the app record your hygiene program or back it up to your Oral-B account. All in all, this is a very good brush with lots of versatility to adjust to your personal dental hygiene.
"
"
To begin with, I want to acknowledge that I've been using the Oral B products for many years.  My dentist highly recommends it and I believe that it's a very good, useful and necessary product.Having said that, I am not convinced that the extra features of the 5000 model warrants it's extra price.  The reason I chose this model is that it features a special deep clean mode and it has artificial intelligence to tell you how your brushing is doing.  Since I've had problems with plaque build up for years despite using the Oral B products, I was looking forward to both features.I thought that the deep clean mode meant that it would pulsate deeper or something scientific like that.  In reality, all it does is time for 3 minutes (45 second intervals) instead of 2 minutes (30 second intervals).Regarding the AI, I was looking forward to something like, ""hold your brush more horizontal"" or ""brush your gums more.""  Instead, I got ""You pressed too hard for 1.2 seconds.""The product comes with a two month no questions asked return policy.  I haven't decided yet whether it's worth the shipping costs and hassle to return it and buy a lower model.

Much stronger than my old cheaper electric brush. I got this one when it was on sale on the site for a really great price. If I had paid full price, this rating would be lower, because ultimately, the frills don't seem like they're worth the full list price. The Bluetooth/app connection is interesting, but at the end of the day is just a way to track if you're brushing your teeth properly and for the right amount of time- something you can do yourself every morning and night. I've tried a few of the brushing programs, and I can't really tell much of a difference.The brush itself is well built and holds a charge for a very long time. The stand looks nice too.

My teenage son is terrible at brushing his teeth especially with braces; at his last dentist appointment he got a really bad review and they now want to see him every three months instead of 6. Out of desperation we purchased this toothbrush, downloaded the app, and he’s been using it for the past 2 or 3 weeks, and the results are amazing! I’m so impressed that he using the app, and we’re not seeing a ton of plaque build up in the upper brackets! This tooth brush should be included with their treatment plan. The only downside I have about this toothbrush, is that we had to buy the braces brush separately, it would amazing to see a braces specific packaging.
"
"
I was anxious about switching to a powered toothbrush as I have extremely sensitive gums that recede if too much pressure is applied in brushing.  This toothbrush is perfect, as there is a sensitivity speed and if you are pressing down to hard a red indication light comes on to tell you.  My teeth feel like they are getting a deeper clean then manual brushing but without the receding gums.  I also like that it buzzes every 30 seconds to tell you when to switch to a new quadrant of the mouth.  Overall very impressed and happy with this product.  Definitely a worthwhile investment!
"
"
This rechargeable electric toothbrush is a very well made and robust product.  I used it on the Sensitive #3 setting, and was very careful to read all the instructions as to the correct angle to deploy it, and at the correct pressure (very little!).  And it does clean my teeth beautifully.  However, I do have large root canals in my back teeth, and I feel the vibration has affected them.  And since losing and replacing them is not a prospect I would look forward to, I have reluctantly decided to forego using this appliance...
"
"
I have the Oral-B 7000 series and I really like it. So, I decided to buy the 5000 for my mom for mother's day and she loves it. I also bought the 5000 for my boyfriend for his birthday. I feel that this electric toothbrush cleans better than the normal toothbrush and really helps into those hard to reach spots. The battery life is pretty good. You can use it several days without charging it. Although there are different modes, none of us use any other modes besides the default one. I used to track my brushing habits by linking the toothbrush to a smartphone app, but I quickly realized that I actually didn't gain much from the information and stopped. The good thing about this model is that it comes with a pressure sensor that turns red if it detects too much pressure. This functionality is very important because my friend's mom who has a lower model without the pressure sensor said it made her teeth sensitive, which I assume is due to pressing too hard. With these electric brushes, you really don't need to put a lot of pressure as a normal toothbrush. However, if you don't want to spend money on the aesthetics and pressure sensor, I would recommend a lower version with less functionality. If you live in the same household, you can actually just buy one toothbrush and use different toothbrush heads, which are detachable.
"
"
Great rechargeable toothbrush. If you have any gum recession your dentist will recommend using an Oral B. This will make bi-annual cleanings less painful too. Minus one star because I never use the smart phone integration -- it's a bit silly if you're a grown-ass woman who has been brushing her teeth since she first got teeth.
"
"
I bought the Oral-B Pro 5000 after trying a Sonicare for a bit after my old Oral-B died after 12years. Sonicare worked ok however my teeth and gums felt better after getting back using an Oral-B again. My choice is Oral-B and I highly recommend this brand.  Oral-B brushes are all good, just depends what all you want in a brush and what extras.
"
"
teeth feel just as clean as when the hygienist cleans them.  I think this was a smart and sensible purchase although the newest one is in Costco for the same price.  Not sure if it would do as good a job????
"
"
After searching and comparing Philips Sonicare tooth brushes to Oral-B...I've realised that either one will work fine and it's just personal preference.I purchased this Pro 5000 unit and it's been great, albeit short battery life compared to the Sonicare, but that's about the only con. I've been satisfied with the purchase so far.This model (Pro 5000) comes WITH the travel case also.  It's not even worth purchasing the black Pro-7000 model as that one is advertised as having a tongue cleaning action and a travel case.  That's not a concern as I got a travel case with mine and I can brush my tongue with my Pro-5000 manually.  Not a deal breaker.
"
"
Im replacing a 10 year old basic Oral B rechargable toothbrush.  This one is so much better.  The only thing that could be improved is the mode settings.  There is no visual indication of which mode it is set to.  However I discovered that you can go to the app and just disable the modes you dont want.  I found that I only wanted 2 of the modes anyway
"
"
Product works well and battery life is great.3 stars for value. I wish I had opted for the lower priced model since I’m never going to change the speed from the fastest or use the blue tooth.
"
"
I like this brush a lot, but constantly am dealing with app syncing and connection issues when brushing. Furthermore, the app doesn't tell you what mode the brush is in. While the Bluetooth is a novelty feature, I was hoping for it to work more consistently.
"
"
I contemplated purchasing a Sonicare brush but as a previous Oral-B owner, I couldn't give this brush up.  It cleans my teeth well, the feels great, love the 5 different settings and the replacement brushes are reasonably prices (relative to the Sonicare brushes).  You can't go wrong with this brush.
"
"
Wow je l'adore , ça décape les dents elle me plaît beaucoup surtout que avant je fesais ça a la main. La connectivité Bluetooth marche super bien
"
"
love the timer that buzzes the brush every 30 seconds, made by brushing habits better. you can save 100$ by not getting the bluetooth version. battery is like 10 days but i charge every night.
"
"
So far so good!  Its an electric toothbrush with lots of features.  It seems a bit overkill to have Bluetooth, but whatever, its a toothbrush!  If you can get it on sale, its a great toothbrush.
"
"
Great brush. Love the pressure semsor, apparently I was brushing waaaayyy too hard!
"
"
For the dd with the perfect teeth who wants to keep them that way.  She loves it!
"
"
This was a replacement for a Oral B that I had for 12 years.  While this one does a good job, the pulsing every 30 seconds and the double pulse to identify 2 minutes are good, but I miss the display in the handle.
"
"
J'utilise les brosses à dents électrique Oral B depuis fort longtemps et celles-ci sont très performantes. Donc celles-ci ne fait pas exception et je vous la suggère fortement.
"
"
It's exactly what I was wanting in a toothbrush. It connects to an app to show you how well you are brushing or if you need to make changes to your brushing habits.
"
"
Surprisingly light. The app is fun the two first time and then useless. We’ll see if the battery last longer than the previous one..
"
"
This is a terrific product to help me do as good a cleaning job on my teeth at home as I possibly can so ,I can spend less time and money at the dentist !!!
"
"
Excellent produit de qualité.  Rend le nettoyage des dents facile et j'aime bien les différents programmes de brossage qu'elle offre.  De plus il est facile de suivre notre utilisation via l'application mobile car cette brosse possède une fonction bluetooth
"
"
Leaves the old pearlies feeling clean and polished cant complain!
"
"
Excellent product, might feel a bit harsh and strong the first time but you'll get used to it right away, does a great job, leaves your mouth feeling super clean.
"
"
Good quality
"
"
great product. use it regularly
"
"
It replaced my old Braun Oral B after many years and I like the faster speed and additional timing sequences. Quite enjoyable to use
"
"
my wife likes it very much
"
"
The battery life is pitiful for a product this expensive. But when it works, it works.
"
"
good product, can connect with mobile app but not convenient enough for use the clock on mobile. Clean and whitening teeth efficiently. Good battery for 3 weeks use. But need 24 hr to charge every time.
"
"
I had an older Oral B power toothbrush (for several years) and noticed that the power had decreased considerably. I was pleasantly surprised by the new brush's power and the app that accompanys it.
"
"
Best value of oral-B electronic toothbrush! I had 1000, 2000 and 3000 over the years, was thinking about jumping to 7000 but 5000's function is really good enough and is much cheaper than 7000!
"
"
Used for a couple days and now went connect to phone... Wont allow for multiple users either.
"
"
Bought four for grandchildren way less cavities now
"
"
Does a MUCH better job than using a manual toothbrush!

Returned after 1 monthHandle started showing signs of rust in 1 MONTH!!!

Everything you would expect from an Oral B (Braun) Pro toothbrush
"
"
Believable great piece of equipment
"
"
Works great. You do get 1 brush head with the package
"
"
Takes a long time to charge with a very bright blue flashing light. Battery doesn't last as long and there is no warning that it is getting low. I liked my old Sonicare better.
"
"
The tooth brush is light, if fits nicely in  your hand and is very powerful

I received this product free from Oral-B. I'm about half way through the trial now, and let me tell you, it's not just the brush, but the app too. The brush is great, I've stuck with the stock head for now, but will pick up a couple of the other options too.  The toothbrush itself is a standard rechargeable brush, and the battery is rather long lived, I've taken it away without the charging base and it's lasted the entire week. I do find it takes a long time to charge and the blue flashing light is rather bright, it's sort of like a dance party in your powder room. The brush has lights on the back to indicate different phases of brushing, as well as when you're brushing too hard it will display a red light. Great visual reminder.The real incentive for me however is the app. The geek factor of a bluetooth enabled toothbrush just speaks to me. Your brush can sync to the app as you go, or it will store your brushing history. You can select the brushing program (sensitive, whitening, plaque fighter etc). I'm running with the plaque fighter, and have set up extended brushing times to target trouble areas. Additionally the app will prompt you to floss, rinse and brush your tongue, tracking these activities as well if you sync while brushing.  And even cooler, the timer starts and stops based on the sound of your toothbrush!You can also sync a second brush to the app.My dentist has been after me for years to get an electric toothbrush, now I see what all the fuss is about!
"
"
I had always wondered if I would like an electric toothbrush but had never purchased one. I love the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries toothbrush!  My teeth only feel this clean after a visit to the dentist and that usually only lasts about a day. Now I have that reallllyyyy clean feeling at home every day and I think they are even getting whiter (even on the daily clean setting, as I often forget to switch to the whitening setting).It took a couple of days to get used to as I'd never used this type of toothbrush before (pressed a little too hard a few times and had to work at holding it, turning it in my mouth and generally not getting toothpaste everywhere when I inadvertently turned it on OUTSIDE of my mouth. lol), but I'd never go back to a ""manual"" toothbrush now. It vibrates in 30 second intervals to let you know if you are on track for having each quarter of your teeth complete.  I'm hooked!I had to get hubby to give me a hand getting the bluetooth to sync with the app on my phone.  I was turning on the whole toothbrush and not just the WIFI. This can be turned on by pressing the down arrow. I felt that wasn't clearly explained and I wasted quite a bit of time trying to figure this piece out. I didn't miss the app though as the toothbrush itself gives you similar feedback, the app is more for the ongoing results I feel. For me, I probably wouldn't pay extra for the bluetooth connectivity.But overall, I love it! Won't be going back to a manual toothbrush anytime soon!I did receive this product for free from Oral-B to test and I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity!

I love the Oral B Smart Series 5000 more than any toothbrush I have ever used! It makes you WANT to brush your teeth over and over again! There is a timer you follow so it's fool proof in making sure you cover all areas of your mouth. It even reminds you to clean your tongue and floss! The only down side is that it has so many features , I'm not sure what all of them are for or if I ever will, but it's a fun toothbrush to use. If you remember to bring it to the washroom; it monitors your use, gives you encouraging messages and reward badges for doing things right. You can also watch a news feed or use other apps at the same time; not sure if I am co-ordinated enough for this but it's cool anyway. There has even been mornings where I am so tired while brushing and the toothbrush itself vibrates like a video game controller so you know its time to switch the section you are brushing! There is a diagram you can look at to actually SEE which area to move to! There is prompts for what to do next, it's like an app or video game for your teeth! Can't say enough good things about this toothbrush , it even feels like a massage for your teeth and tells you when you brush too hard! I'm not really one for bringing my phone in the bathroom ( RULE against it in my house) BUT that doesn't change the fact that with or without your phone; it's the best toothbrush I have ever used! I did receive this free to try from Oral B, but we are now buying them for the whole family!

I received Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries brush from Oral-B free to try.  I'm using it for about 2 months and I'm able to give it full review. Before Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I only used manual tooth brush. The most important qualities I was expecting from Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries were: excellent plaque removal, do not hurt my gums and easy to reach all areas. All smartness and blue tooth technology was an additional bonus. First I installed an Oral-B app, where I typed in my upcoming dental hygienist appointment- yes, it has the calendar build in! I synched Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries to my phone, watched all instructional videos and started using it. The brush was spinning gentle brushing my teeth and cleaning near my gums, where most plague and tartar reside. It went very easy to the very back of my mouth, to clean those never reachable before areas. Brush has a vibration+light indicator-timer splitting time of programmed brushing into 4 eaqual  parts. I was also watching the app, showing the timer as well. Brush also has high pressure indicator. If you press too hard it'll buzz and flash red light. After I finished brushing, the feeling I had in my mouth was like I just had hygienist appointment. Smooth!  App asked me to complete tongue cleaning, flossing and rinsing.The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries has a removable head, storage and travel container. We bought additional head for my husband. The only disadvantage we noticed blue tooth synchronized all mine sessions to his phone. Basically if you don't use the app during brushing, toothbrush will store sessions itself and will synchronize it to the first phone. Since we don't always have our phone while brushing teeth, statistics was a bit  messed up. But it was a minor thing for me. The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries cleans teeth with amazing result, my dental hygienist was very impressed, as I shared my excitement about this new brush.  It was very gentle. Plaque and tartar was removed from the places near my gums. Head is so small, I was able to maneuver it behind my teeth at the back. It will remind to floss, rinse and clean tongue.  The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries has several programs for deep cleaning, massage and polishing your teeth. Training, motivating and improving my brushing habits and technique.Absolutely great brush, 5 stars. I would 100% recommend the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries to anyone.
"

I was a little hesitant to start using the Oral-B Pro 5000 at first - as I have really sensitive teeth.  My fears were totally unfounded!  I used the gentle setting and the massage setting with no problems!  My teeth feel totally clean and gums too.  I think after a couple of weeks I will be able to use a tougher setting as well.  Love the Bluetooth Connectivity and it is great for keeping tracking of brushing habits - especially for the kids.  Easy to use controls and great battery life.  My Dentist is gonna be wowed on my next Check Up! #GotItFree from #OralB!

This is my first ever electronic tooth brush.This Oral B Pro 5000 with Bluetooth connectivity tooth brush is Amazing.I'll definitely get replacement head for my husband .It cleans your teeth so well. Gets into every crease. Tells you how many minutes you should brush each side . Love the indicator if u r pressing too hard on your teeth as well.It's quiet enough.I'm very impressed with it.Love it.  Got it got free from  Oral-B.  Thanks.'''''

I received this Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth Connectivity toothbrush free from Oral-B through a BzzAgent campaign for my unbiased opinion. This is my first rechargeable toothbrush and I love it.  It gives me a dentist clean feeling after each use! It is easy to set up right out of the box and takes about 12 hours to fully charge. I have used it twice a day for the last week and it still has 3/4 charge. I downloaded the Oral-B app to my phone to try it out and I find it useful - I realized after using it that I wasn't brushing nearly long enough. It also has good reminders to brush your tongue, floss and use mouthwash. The toothbrush vibrates when you are brushing too hard or when it's time to move to another quadrant of teeth to ensure you are brushing all your teeth. I'm definitely a convert and will never go back to my manual brush.

I received this toothbrush as a free trial from oral b.  It makes my teeth feel great! Like I've just been to the dentist.  I do find the bluetooth connectivity a bit odd since I don't bring my phone to the bathroom.  Full strength is a bit brain rattling but you can turn that down and use the sensitive setting. If you do use the app to keep track it's kind of a neat feature.  I've always been a manual brush user but this definitely gets the job done better.

Recieved the product from BzzAgent.  Fantastic Product.  The app options are endless.  It will send you reminders and challenge for your oral care.  I may take a bit of getting used to if you haven't used a electric toothbrush before, but it makes you feel like you just came back from the dentist, each and every time!!  Fantastic.  Thank you Oral B

I received the Orab-B pro 5000 smart series toothbrush from Oral B so that I could try it and give my opinion.Up until now I’ve only ever used a manual toothbrush and didn’t know why anyone would want an electric one. The fact that this one came with an app not only peaked my curiousity but awoke my inner skeptic as well. Do we really need an app for our tooth brush?The answer is YES! The Oral-B pro 5000 leaves your teeth so clean it actually gives you added confidence in your smile and the fact that your breath is clean and fresh.In a time when we’re all too busy and cut corners everywhere, the Oral-B pro 5000 toohbrush and app is a perfect reminder that we need to slow down and take our oral hygiene seriously.The app is a perfect companion and is almost like having your dental professional with you the whole time. It’s important to note however that the app only tracks one person’s progress.The app contains a bunch of instructional videos which are straight forward and easy to watch. Once you’re ready, launch the app and commence the process.The 1st part is the brushing. A timer comes on and you’ll see a 3D model of set of teeth appear on the screen. One section will be highlighted which is the section you should start with. Depending on the setting and length of time you’ve choose, the handle of the tooth brush will vibrate and flash at the proper intervals so that you know it’s time to move on to the next highlighted section. You keep going until all the brushing is done you’ll get a signal letting you know that you’ve completed the 1st step.Step two is the tongue brushing and step 3 is flossing.  You’ll also have a reminder to use a fluoride rinse. You can skip these steps if you want but the app will track how many times you complete or skip each step.You can also keep track of your dental appointments, add your dentist info and get other tips and tricks.The brush head itself is versatile and pulsates and rotates. You can just hold the brush against your teeth and gums and the work is done for you!For me the bristles are too soft. I prefer a harder brush so I pressed hard when holding it against my gums causing the red light to flash and the app to tell me I was brushing too hard.The size of the brush is small enough that I can easily manoeuvre it to hard to reach places but big enough that I feel it’s actually doing a good job.It’s recommended to change the heads every 3-6months but it’s ok as replacement heads are readily available and not that expensive.The brush itself comes with a price tag but it’s worth it once you realize that your mouth is much fresher and cleaner than it use to be and your dental appointments could end up being shorter and less expensive!I would absolutely recommend the Oral B Pro 5000. It leaves teeth clean and fresh giving you one less things to worry about.There should be an app for everything we do so we’re forced to really examine how we do things! It has forced me to slow down and really look at the way I brush my teeth which has resulted in better oral health for me.

NiMH non replaceable battery.Crap travel case made of cheap plastic.Useless bluetooth function.Not better than the 20$ basic model.Got a Philips instead, with li-ion, nice case, uv cleaning for the same price.

I love this brush and how gentle and soft it is on my teeth.. wood handle is something to get used to but better than plastics..Great value as well with 10 brushes..If you enjoy the ultra soft brushes then this is the one to get... Soft but firm enough to clean..
"
"
My first experience with a wooden toothbrush. The bristles are a bit long though my mouth is smaller so maybe not a problem for the average mouth. They feel pretty good though they may deteriorate a bit faster than the average plastic toothbrush. I've only been using it for almost 2 weeks and it is showing signs of degradation. The handle is also splintering from constant use. Not sure if other wooden toothbrushes have the same issue. Overall seems to be working well enough for the price.
"
"
This product is great for environmental reasons, which is why I so badly wanted to be on board. Unfortunately, and it could just be personal preference, I hate the feeling of the wood rubbing on my teeth as I brush. Due to sensitivity, it literally gives me chills, and so I had to go back to regular plastic toothbrushes since they glide much better.My wife still likes the bamboo toothbrush and uses them, but I can't stand them, which is unfortunate.
"
"
perfect size, very soft and feel nice against my teeth but also firm enough to sweep away bacteria and plaque around each tooth. Pack of 10 is great so I can change brushes every 3 weeks. Even the packaging is biodegradable.
"
"
I really like theses toothbrushes. The bristles are soft but not flimsy at all, the handle is easy to hold and presentation is great.Will definitely buy again.
"
"
Great reusable brushes. Solid and durable. Easy to brush with. Great value!
"

The bristles are silky soft and they feel great on the teeth and gums. Great value and packaging. Will definitely buy again.

Great presentation, no surprises. Just pure bamboo toothbrushes!10/10, will buy again!

I really like these and I've gone through 3, but for the first few uses, a bunch of bristles come out into my mouth. Will buy from another brand next time.

The only real downsides here are that it is loud, and you can't choose the color. I chose the listing with the blue toothbrush in hopes that I would get a blue one, but they sent me a pink one. I live alone so I don't really mind. But others might. Other than that, seems pretty good for the price. Just make sure not to push on your teeth too hard while its on. You only need light pressure. If you want a better brush, you gotta pay more. I got this one on sale so I am pretty happy. If you've got a smaller mouth, you should note that this brush head is pretty large.
"
"
There was no choice given for colour and they sent him bright pink. As mentioned by others, this toothbrush is loud. We can hear it from the first floor even with the second floor bathroom door closed and the fan is running. It does the job though.Update: I bought myself one and I hate it. It is not only loud, it feels like it is going to shatter my teeth! I can only use it if I leave it off.
"
"
I have tried all 3 brands that are available for under $10. All work equally as well. The only difference - and it does really matter -  is 2 are very difficult to turn on and off. Why? I was going to buy a set for my senior parents but thought""they won't be able to turn it on!"" This is one of the 2 brands. The 3rd has a much more comfortable and convenient push button.
"
"
VERY POWERFUL! Maybe even to powerful but does a wonder in cleaning your teeth. I paired mine with the crest gum detoxify toothpaste and it keeps my breath and teeth feeling fresh and clean!! (When used 2+ times a day, as suggested)
"
"
Bought 2 of them. Amazing product which I have been buying every year (keep changing them for hygiene not cause they break down). Excellent quality for the price.
"
"
I used to love this brand of electric brush years ago and decided to buy it again recently. They are total duds do not waste your $10! I brushed once, put the brushnoff to the side standing up and the next day it was dead because all the water popped into the motor and batteries. When I opened the battery compartment all the water poured out along with battery gunk.$10 and only got one brushing out of it.Do better Arm and Hammer. The quality of your products have plummeted.
"
"
It was on sale when I bought it.. I bought them for my husband and mom they are so happy with the product and now Iam jealous I will buy again once they will be on sale again ❤️
"
"
The first few uses the battery had the tooth brush on turbo! It was almost tooth much. After a 3 weeks using the toothbrush The battery needs replaced. Other then the issue with the battery the tooth brush is great.
"

I like this brush, reaches back teeth well! Wish batteries lasted longer.
"
"
Why buy a electric toothbrush when you an buy a operated spinbrush for under $10Great value , I'm enjoying this :)I will buy replacement heads in a few months
"
"
The Toothbrush ceased working within 2 days.  I inspected the batteries to find one had leaked and had corroded.There is damage to the terminals inside the case and it will not work even with new batteries. I would like a replacement for the defective one that is unusable.
"
"
Awesome brush for an awesome price! Love it,  bought another for my husband.  Can't beat that
"
"
Works great
"
"
J'ai bien reçu ces brosses à dents et elle fonctionne très bien.  Et c'est bien meilleur marcher qu'à la pharmacie.
"
"
Great looking item
"
"
A1 thx
"
"
It works fine , but because water drains under the brush and go inside, I am giving it only 4 stars.
"
"
Repeat purchase
"
"
This product works well to clean your teeth but what's disappointing is the noise level. It sounds as loud of drilling a nail into a wall. Extremely loud, so much so that it can wake up your roommate.
"
"
Doing same work as the expensive toothbrush does.
"
"
The vibration is too strong. Very difficult to get in between the teeth
"
"
JUST AS I EXPECTED GOOD PRODUCT
"
"
Best tooth brush on the market and the best price
"
"
After a week it no longer spun. Not worth the money.
"
"
Battery was basically dead the first time I used it, hog waste of money
"
"
Nice product.
"
"
Loud and feels a bit cheap, but for the price (~$9) is a great buy.
"
"
Great product fast shipping
"
"
merci

excellent!

We bought these brushes after our dentist suggested our kids should try a power brush to get a better clean. So far I am pretty happy.I really like that these brushes have replaceable heads. A lot of the other battery powered brushes are all one piece, and throwing away a whole brush every three months seems incredibly wasteful (and expensive).  I also like that the batteries seem easy to replace. And my kids like the different colours so they can easily tell which one is theirs.The only thing I don't like is that the on/off switch slides up and down to work. This can be a little difficult if the handle is wet. A push button would be much easier. But that is the only real issue and I am curious to see how their next dental visits go after using these.
"
"
WARNING!! Likely 90% of reviews here didn't use the product for even a few week or month before posting review.I have bought multiple of these over time. The 1st easily leaked water into the battery area causing leaking battery acid. The 2nd did the same and eventually also leaked inside causing damage to the electronics & it stopped working. The 3rd I just got a couple weeks ago had it's battery die after 1 use, then after replacing batteries with quality Energizer batteries it lasted 1 use and come the next morning it won't even turn on no matter what new batteries I put in it and I was even careful to not get much water on it.After closer inspection opening it I can see that the units are not even sealed properly to even be water-resistant let alone water proof IP67 (1meter).The 2nd unit over time also started cracking and the plastic breaking apart as it became brittle. Likely they use very low-quality plastic.
"
"
A little bit loud but who cares as long as it works but they send random colors so fingers crossed that u get a decent color.
"
"
Never buy this toothbrush! The AA batheries are were stuck in and I had to cut the case to take the batteries! Just pissed me off!!!
"
"
Haven't opened yet as there for stocking stuffers.  Order three because of the great price.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Works and cleans great. I thought oh what a bunch of whiners when I was reading the reviews on this about the noise. But yeah, it's so super loud. My husband asked me if the toothbrush hurt my teeth.. I was like huh why would it hurt?He said because it sounds painfully loud. I have 2 kids I don't really hear loud anymore but seriously like the engineer here could of put a little piece of foam around the motor or something.  But still 4 stars for the price and performance it's great.
"
"
We absolutely love these. Our whole family uses them. These toothbrushes for under $10 is a steal of a deal and a great stocking stuffer.
"
"
Good little toothbrush - my son has been using in since Christmas - doesn't eat batteries, and is easy to keep clean....plus it has survived being used by an 11 year old twice a day for over 6 months....not too shabby.
"
"
Kind of upset it came in pink because I was going to gift this to a male, so I guess I'll keep it for myself. Its a great spinbrush that is very affordable and gets rid of all plaque!
"
"
Bad toothbrush, the battery won't hold its charge amd die every 2 days. The brush isn't strong enough to brush your teeth.
"
"
I gave these to my 11 and 8 year olds. They enjoy the “brushing faster”, more sturdy than the cartoon versions with replacement heads available on line
"
"
Cleans good but wayyy tooo noisy  it’s like a lawn mower!
"
"
Got on sale so it did the job until I got myudualy toothbrush
"
"
Not impressed, struggled with the switch, battery life not great
"
"
Kind of bulky but cleaned my teeth better than my other toothbrushes !
"
"
Work as described
"
"
better than previous models
"
"
Very good and not expensive
"
"
Très bon
"
"
Exactly as shown and great for the kids to use
"
"
First time with a spinbrush, wow this is great, it feels good during and after the brushing. Must try! Some said it is loud, i personaly don’t find it loud at all, even wife and son do not think that it is loud.  J’adore ce produit, je recommande, c’est la première fois que j’ai une spinbrush, je trouve que ça fait comme un massage sur les dents. Je ne trouve pas qu’elle est bruyante.
"

yay clean teeth!

I have tried all 3 brands that are available for under $10. All work equally as well. The only difference - and it does really matter -  is 2 are very difficult to turn on and off. Why? I was going to buy a set for my senior parents but thought""they won't be able to turn it on!"" This is one of the 2 brands. The 3rd has a much more comfortable and convenient push button.
"
"
VERY POWERFUL! Maybe even to powerful but does a wonder in cleaning your teeth. I paired mine with the crest gum detoxify toothpaste and it keeps my breath and teeth feeling fresh and clean!! (When used 2+ times a day, as suggested)
"
"
Bought 2 of them. Amazing product which I have been buying every year (keep changing them for hygiene not cause they break down). Excellent quality for the price.
"
"
I used to love this brand of electric brush years ago and decided to buy it again recently. They are total duds do not waste your $10! I brushed once, put the brushnoff to the side standing up and the next day it was dead because all the water popped into the motor and batteries. When I opened the battery compartment all the water poured out along with battery gunk.$10 and only got one brushing out of it.Do better Arm and Hammer. The quality of your products have plummeted.
"
"
It was on sale when I bought it.. I bought them for my husband and mom they are so happy with the product and now Iam jealous I will buy again once they will be on sale again ❤️
"
"
The first few uses the battery had the tooth brush on turbo! It was almost tooth much. After a 3 weeks using the toothbrush The battery needs replaced. Other then the issue with the battery the tooth brush is great.
"
"
perfect better than most mechanical tooth brushes. it is loud but who cares as long as it cleans your teeth
"
"
The bristles and harder than I would have expected for medium bristles
"
"
Great value. Works well. Easy to clean. A little bit noise.
"
"
I like this brush, reaches back teeth well! Wish batteries lasted longer.
"
"
Why buy a electric toothbrush when you an buy a operated spinbrush for under $10Great value , I'm enjoying this :)I will buy replacement heads in a few months
"
"
The Toothbrush ceased working within 2 days.  I inspected the batteries to find one had leaked and had corroded.There is damage to the terminals inside the case and it will not work even with new batteries. I would like a replacement for the defective one that is unusable.
"
"
Awesome brush for an awesome price! Love it,  bought another for my husband.  Can't beat that
"
"
Works great
"
"
J'ai bien reçu ces brosses à dents et elle fonctionne très bien.  Et c'est bien meilleur marcher qu'à la pharmacie.
"
"
Great looking item
"
"
A1 thx
"
"
It works fine , but because water drains under the brush and go inside, I am giving it only 4 stars.
"
"
Repeat purchase
"
"
This product works well to clean your teeth but what's disappointing is the noise level. It sounds as loud of drilling a nail into a wall. Extremely loud, so much so that it can wake up your roommate.
"
"
Doing same work as the expensive toothbrush does.
"
"
The vibration is too strong. Very difficult to get in between the teeth
"
"
JUST AS I EXPECTED GOOD PRODUCT
"
"
Best tooth brush on the market and the best price
"
"
After a week it no longer spun. Not worth the money.
"
"
Battery was basically dead the first time I used it, hog waste of money
"
"
Nice product.
"
"
Loud and feels a bit cheap, but for the price (~$9) is a great buy.
"
"
Great product fast shipping
"
"
merci
"
"
excellent!
"
"
Works great for the price!

We bought these brushes after our dentist suggested our kids should try a power brush to get a better clean. So far I am pretty happy.I really like that these brushes have replaceable heads. A lot of the other battery powered brushes are all one piece, and throwing away a whole brush every three months seems incredibly wasteful (and expensive).  I also like that the batteries seem easy to replace. And my kids like the different colours so they can easily tell which one is theirs.The only thing I don't like is that the on/off switch slides up and down to work. This can be a little difficult if the handle is wet. A push button would be much easier. But that is the only real issue and I am curious to see how their next dental visits go after using these.
"
"
WARNING!! Likely 90% of reviews here didn't use the product for even a few week or month before posting review.I have bought multiple of these over time. The 1st easily leaked water into the battery area causing leaking battery acid. The 2nd did the same and eventually also leaked inside causing damage to the electronics & it stopped working. The 3rd I just got a couple weeks ago had it's battery die after 1 use, then after replacing batteries with quality Energizer batteries it lasted 1 use and come the next morning it won't even turn on no matter what new batteries I put in it and I was even careful to not get much water on it.After closer inspection opening it I can see that the units are not even sealed properly to even be water-resistant let alone water proof IP67 (1meter).The 2nd unit over time also started cracking and the plastic breaking apart as it became brittle. Likely they use very low-quality plastic.
"
"
A little bit loud but who cares as long as it works but they send random colors so fingers crossed that u get a decent color.
"
"
Never buy this toothbrush! The AA batheries are were stuck in and I had to cut the case to take the batteries! Just pissed me off!!!
"
"
Haven't opened yet as there for stocking stuffers.  Order three because of the great price.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Works and cleans great. I thought oh what a bunch of whiners when I was reading the reviews on this about the noise. But yeah, it's so super loud. My husband asked me if the toothbrush hurt my teeth.. I was like huh why would it hurt?He said because it sounds painfully loud. I have 2 kids I don't really hear loud anymore but seriously like the engineer here could of put a little piece of foam around the motor or something.  But still 4 stars for the price and performance it's great.
"
"
We absolutely love these. Our whole family uses them. These toothbrushes for under $10 is a steal of a deal and a great stocking stuffer.
"
"
Good little toothbrush - my son has been using in since Christmas - doesn't eat batteries, and is easy to keep clean....plus it has survived being used by an 11 year old twice a day for over 6 months....not too shabby.
"
"
Kind of upset it came in pink because I was going to gift this to a male, so I guess I'll keep it for myself. Its a great spinbrush that is very affordable and gets rid of all plaque!
"
"
Bad toothbrush, the battery won't hold its charge amd die every 2 days. The brush isn't strong enough to brush your teeth.
"
"
I gave these to my 11 and 8 year olds. They enjoy the “brushing faster”, more sturdy than the cartoon versions with replacement heads available on line
"
"
Cleans good but wayyy tooo noisy  it’s like a lawn mower!
"
"
Got on sale so it did the job until I got myudualy toothbrush
"
"
Not impressed, struggled with the switch, battery life not great
"
"
Kind of bulky but cleaned my teeth better than my other toothbrushes !
"
"
Work as described
"
"
better than previous models
"
"
Very good and not expensive
"
"
Très bon
"
"
Exactly as shown and great for the kids to use
"
"
First time with a spinbrush, wow this is great, it feels good during and after the brushing. Must try! Some said it is loud, i personaly don’t find it loud at all, even wife and son do not think that it is loud.  J’adore ce produit, je recommande, c’est la première fois que j’ai une spinbrush, je trouve que ça fait comme un massage sur les dents. Je ne trouve pas qu’elle est bruyante.
"
"
yay clean teeth!
"
"
This is only used by me, one person.  So it's not from over-use.  I only charge the toothbrush when the battery indicator is low and I charge for a day or overnight, just like most devices should be done.  I don't leave it on for longer than 8 hours.  After less than a year of use, it no longer charges.  I place it on the charging base and the charging light does not go on, nor does it charge. I regret not buying the warranty.
"
"
Product is seriously flawed, had the toothbrush replaced twice because it would either not charge or not hold the charge.  The third one just gave out as well, it won't charge either while it's only four months old.  Obviously thisis not a one off issue.  As Amazon doesn't except a return after four months I now have a $ 150 manual toothbrush......Update: Amazon just offered to have me ship the item back for a refund, as apparently I'm not the only one that has had problems.  So 1 star for Oral-B for selling a flawed product and 4 stars for Amazon as they offered a proper solution.
"
"
I’ve had this toothbrush for well over 2 years now. It. Is. AMAZING! Worth every 5 cent coin. The cleaning action has saved me from whitening my teeth as much as I used to.The brush warning is great at letting me know I’m being too aggressive by flashing red and has helped with my gum recession. My dentist has seen a difference and I haven’t had a cavity in over 2 years.It’s very durable and has traveled the world with me. The battery is still in good shape.I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone interested in improving their oral health routine.
"
"
This is a Christmas gift so I can’t comment yet on how it works or opinions of the actual product, but when I opened the amazon box the Oral-B box inside was already open and had a small tear. Not something you really like to see when you’re gifting something and it’s such a personal item. Was it returned? Did someone else already have it opened and changed their mind?  If so did they actually handle the toothbrush?  The box should have been closed and sealed. The next time I see it in store I will be looking to see if they are sealed.
"
"
I have had the 5000 series and wanted to upgrade to the 7000. While I don't see a significant difference in the two especially for the money spent, it is still a very good brush. I do like the fact it works with their APP to keep track but the OralB app needs a significant amount of work for this product to actually be worthwhile to have bluetooth.  However if you are debating between the 5000 or 7000 just buy the 5000 you won't see any difference for the price you pay for this one. Sure it has a nicer case for taking it with you but outside of that there just is no differential between them in terms of what an average person would use it for - unless you really need the 7 different cleaning modes.
"
"
This is my first electric toothbrush, after considering one for a few years. I’ve been using it for a week now, and I can honestly say that my teeth have never felt so squeaky clean. The brush is easy to use and I’m extremely pleased. I purchased a few extra brush heads to use, in addition to the 3 basic brushes that came with the set. I’m overall impressed by how well the brush reach the gumline and also clean around my crown. I don’t use the Bluetooth connection to the app. While some people might find it useful to understand the amount of time to brush each quadrant and the amount of pressure applied to each tooth. I find this as big-time overkill. I don’t need this amount of info. Some might but in retrospect, I could have purchased the unit without the Bluetooth feature.Overall, I am extremely satisfied. This is one of the absolute best hygiene purchases I’ve ever made. I’m so happy I took the dive into an advanced level of dental care that is so easy too! My future dental appointment are already thanking me in advance!
"
"
I have always been skeptical about electric toothbrushes. ""Why should I need one, as long as I have a good pair of hands?"" was my argument. Then, one day I bought this toothbrush quite by impulse, and that changed my entrenched notion for good.I simply love this toothbrush! First, it is like having your own dental hygienist right in your washroom. Second, the brush is well built; six months on, it  works as good as it did the day I purchased it! I complement my brushing with flossing, and use mouth wash. That is as good as it gets!
"
"
What can I say that hasn't already been said about this fantastic set?You get what you pay for, and with the exception of the portable carrying case, the included products are made in Germany, which, is a premier manufacturer of quality goods.To claim that Braun went all out with their most expensive electric toothbrush package would be an understatement in my opinion.  Much of the included goodies weren't necessary, but absolutely welcomed and appreciated!Furthermore, I realize the Bluetooth feature which allows for the connection and synchronization of this fabulous toothbrush with a free smartphone app (available for iOS and Android operating systems) is not something most owners consider essential, but I would beg to differ, because as someone who ""suffers"" from 'Gadget Fever,' and, someone who likes to adhere to a punctual daily schedule, I absolutely LOVE this feature!Overall, I'd have to consider this product to be tied for numero uno with the obvious contender from Philips, which, I also happen to own (but have worn out, hence, the purchase of its main competitor's flagship offering).TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read): a solid 5/5 and highly recommended!Have yourselves a wonderful day, and be sure to treat your teeth like royalty, because if there's one thing above all which our elders seem to regret with respect to their lifestyle choices (or lack there of), I swear that the topic of inadequate dental hygiene has reigned supreme in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).
"
"
I bought this a year ago around Christmas and after using the brush every day for 365 days we can say I truly love it.This system does help to get your teeth feeling really clean and well taken care of. We only charge it when the light flashes on the base to remind us to and so it holds a charge very well. On average we charge it only 1x every 7-10 days or so depending.The little clock that syncs to the brush - the batteries died about 11 months after we bought it, but that's an easy fix.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush. I have been using the deep clean setting and can notice a difference in the way my teeth feel. Almost like when you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Everyday they feel great. I think there is lots of things in the box that I won’t use, it comes with 2 cases which will be nice when I travel. The 3 different brush heads and nice too, you can see which one you like best and order those. It comes with a little battery powered timer thing that I believe tells you how your brushing is going, I have not used that. The charging takes 24 hours but I think you can go a few weeks on a charge so that is no problem.

Cette brosse va beaucoup mieux que ma oral-b à 40$. Elle vibre plus. La pile dure au moins 1 semaines, sans que la qualité du brossage diminue. J’aime la minuterie incluse qui affiche le temps de brossage(en autre temps, l’heure). J’aime aussi l’option qui permet de faire une vibration aux 30 secondes afin de changer de zone. Et le limiteur de pression fonctionne très bien, si on pèse trop fort, la brosse ralenti, une lumière allume et un vibration se fait.
"
"
[I bought it July 2018 and the bluetooth stopped working December 23 2019. I'm going to see if I can find my warranty to get it repaired.]EDIT: actually, I did figured out what was wrong. My toothbrush had the bluetooth function turned off by accident and I didn't even know you could do that. I just had to hold both buttons down for 2 seconds and it was fixed. It missed a few days of recording my brush times because of this.
"
"
I really like the job this toothbrush does, but I'm not happy with the battery life (roughly a week). The charger is not convenient to keep in our bathroom, so I have to charge it in another room. And the case does not charge it, so if I travel (and I travel frequently) I have to bring the charger too.If you have room to leave it in the charger all the time, and never (rarely) travel, it does a fantastic job on your teeth, and has multiple modes to ensure you get a great job done.
"
"
Great brush I dont use the app but have had it for almost 4 years and it's still going strong no issues at all . I buy the large replacement brushhead pack from costco and it last be about a year or more.My dentist has noticed a difference too also love the traveling case. Have gone on vacations for 2 weeks and works on a single charge would definitely reccomend . I share it with my fiancee the brushes have a color coding system so you wont be confused about who's is who.Would definitely get 100 percent great product
"
"
It is just OK. But I had used the diamond clean and it both, so it is so easy for me to compare them, I chose diamond clean over it, because somehow this product is not strong enough to make my teeth clean enough as the other product did. There is advantage however, it has clock to make you aware your timing of brushing, and their replacement heads are cheaper
"
"
This is one of my favourite things I bought and it has the amazing app for your phone which helps just track all the details of your of your brushing it it’s it’s Gary did it so it’s really really good and it makes brushing teeth kind of fun so someone who used to hate manually brushing his teeth and now brushing their teeth all the time because of this little vanity thing that does the super efficient job and when I go the dentist my dentist tells me there are no problems and I really attribute most of that to the Oral-B
"
"
Decided to buy oral-b instead of Philips sonicare, I regret it. After 1 year of purchase, my toothbrush is completely dead, won't charge nor start up no matter how hard I try to get it to work. Before this point, the toothbrush was already giving me a few issues such as turning itself off constantly. It would turn itself off at least 5 times in 2 minutes of brushing my teeth, extremely frustrating. Don't bother with this toothbrush unless you're eager to replace your electric toothbrush every year.
"
"
I have been looking for a great toothbrush in a long time. This works perfectly and really does an incredible job. I never felt my teeth so clean in my life, honestly. It has great power, battery lasts for a while, even on vacation without charger, it holds charges for twice a day 2 weeks brushing.It is powerful, well built and durable !I have been very pleased with this product wince I bought it last year. It worked so great, I had to buy one for my wife !! :) We both love them !I highly recommend, especially at deal price I saw last week, I paid around 180$ CAD for each of ours and it is REALLY worth every penny I invested !PLUS: MADE IN GERMANYVery good pick ! You won't regret it !
"
"
Best to use before this before your neighbors’ bedtime hours as they will most definitely hear you and think you’re brushing your teeth with a jackhammer.Don’t think this is an ultrasonic brush as this is basically a power tool for your teeth.Battery doesn’t last as long and you’ll have to charge it at least 2X a week.Overall a very Meh purchase.
"
"
I love it. Mine came with 3 heads. So me and my daughter uses it. Teeth feel a lot more cleaner. I don't understand the timer they provided with it and haven't connected it to any bluetooth. I've had for a few months now. I travel with it a lot. So far the longest ive had it without charge has been 5 days. It didn't die on me so I'm sure i could have used it a another 2 days
"

Upgraded my old Oral B toothbrush. Love this thing. I thought it was pretty silly with bluetooth and that screen but at the time it was on a crazy sale so I got it (hey I'm an early adopter:) If you already have had an Oral B electric toothbrush you know what to expect. I've been using these for years, never had a cavity.I really haven't used the bluetooth connectivity with my phone because, come on. But I'll give it a shot sometime. The display with the happy face I also thought was gimmicky, but you know what? It immediately made me conscious of how short my typical tooth brushing session is and more often than not successfully incentivizes me to go the full two minutes. My teeth are happy as is my dentist.The carrying case is also great for travelling, though it's a bit bulkier than it really needs to be and sadly doesn't hold the charger. That said, I've gotten away with being on the road a week or two without charging the thing (and the case keeps it from turning on and draining in my luggage).
"
"
This brush provides a professional level of cleaning at home and I'm glad I decided to buy it. I hadn't noticed that my previous electric toothbrush wasn't holding a charge as well, and wasn't as powerful as it had seemed, until I decided to order this one. Not only does it have various settings, such as deep clean and tongue clean, it comes with three different brush heads, a sturdy travel case, and the clock/timer which helps you keep track of your brushing time. It apparently lets you know if you're applying too much pressure but I haven't encountered this yet. I have found it much easier to track my brushing time as sometimes the standard intermittent change in vibration is easy to ignore if you're not focusing on it. The smiley face and stars when you've brushed enough are a nice touch, even if you're an adult. Overall, I'm happy with this item. It does seem to need more frequent charging than I expected, but I'm not sure if I'm just brushing longer, or if I may need to contact Oral B. I've only been using it a couple of weeks, and have to determine if the battery is functioning as it should, and will need to update my review.

I never would have thought I would spend over $100 on a tooth brush, however my dentist recommended that I get a real electric toothbrush not the $12 spin brushes I was using. I was keeping my eye out for a sale and I finally picked this up on Amazon's black friday sale for $120, (over $100 off). I have been using it for a few weeks now. Both my wife and I share the brush and we have our colour coded brush heads that we can keep in the handy stand, and we even made use of the traveling case for a recent weekend getaway.As for the toothbrush itself, I like the timer it indicates the different modes you are in and the time for each brushing zone. I especially like the pressure sensor, while the brush itself does flash a red light when you brush too hard, you are able to see the pressure sensor warning (i.e the frowning face) on the timer display unit more easily. My only con so far, is the brush itself does not indicate which mode it's in, so you must rely on the timer display, which could be problematic if you are traveling and don't want to carry the extra device. I've only tried the floss action head so far, not the whitening head.Overall I am happy with the results, although I don't have experience with other high end toothbrushes. The real results will be when I go for my next cleaning at the dentists office.--------------*UPDATE*Visited the dentist office for a regular cleaning after a few months of use with this and a few months of use with my old brush. They said they noticed a big improvment in my teeth and asked me what I was doing differently. All i've done was switch from a Crest spin brush to this. Also I notice that when I floss my teeth after using this toothbrush I dont have to remove much buildup from between the teeth. i.e the brush gets most of the 'in between' ..

Cette brosse à dent avec tête remplaçable et support convient à toute la famille puisque chaque membre peut avoir sa brossette. La fonction Bluetooth ne m’est pas très utile mais la brosse est tout de meme excellent et contient de nombreux programmes.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It makes my teeth feel very clean. I like that it comes with three different brush heads to try out with one you like best. I've seen it one sale at $125 on amazon a month or two ago, so I recommend waiting to buy it instead of buying it full price. I haven't used the app because I don't feel like I need it. This is my first electric toothbrush, and I'm never going back to a manual one!
"
"
It's a great unit overall, it cleans very well. I have only two issues with it, which are the following:- You cannot know which option you are own, basically you have to always carry that small LCD with you- You cannot charge with the travel case, that means you have to bring the stand with you.
"
"
I bought this because I have had quite a lot of treatment on my teeth recently and my friends and family who have got an electric toothbrush have said they feel it's contributed to improvements in their dental health. The price initially put me off but I thought buying an expensive toothbrush would encourage me to use all it's features and, although I've only had it 3 weeks, it has. It's really easy to set up, although takes about 24 hours to fully charge for the first time and the features are helpful. It comes with 3 different brushes, a regular brush, whitening and tongue cleaner. The timer feature is really helpful for me. I like that it vibrates when 30 seconds has passed so you know when to brush a different quadrant of your mouth, and if you apply to much pressure a red light comes on. At 2 minutes the brush pulses again to let you know when you're done. To be able to monitor my progress on the App is super helpful and hopefully it means I'm getting better habits. It has cute features personalized for you too like it displays, news, weather etc., I assume to distract you from over concentrating on brushing. It also has a smart travel case which looks good. As I said, I've only had it for a few weeks so time will tell but, so far so good!

A great purchase - worth every penny paid! I used battery operated Oral B toothbrushes previously. Can't believe the difference now with this electric Oral B. Like comparing a machine gun to a toy pistol. Easy to get used to from the outset.Beneficial having a personal timer matched to it - ensures proper usage time-wise. It performs as advertised - with no problems at all so far. Quality seems to be good!

I used the brush 4 times since I bought it and I have to admit I'm extremely impressed; I'm noticing my teeth getting whiter, the plaques are slowly ""melting"" away, I can see their colour as I clean. The feel of cleaning my teeth is as if I'm at the destinst getting my teeth professionally done. I recommend 10 min daily, play a YouTube video as you're cleaning as s good way of timing yourself.

This is a great toothbrush. Comes with a handy travel case which is awesome and easily washed. The pressure sensor is great. Never realized I was pushing too hard!The little screen it comes with it ok. It counts down a 2 minute timer and shows you what part of your mouth to brush. But once it ran out of batteries we never replaced them and haven't missed it.I never did setup bluetooth on it... Probably should.Overall a decent toothbrush, but definitely on the expensive side.

I have been looking for a great toothbrush in a long time. This works perfectly and really does an incredible job. I never felt my teeth so clean in my life, honestly. It has great power, battery lasts for a while, even on vacation without charger, it holds charges for twice a day 2 weeks brushing.I have been very pleased with this product wince I bought it last year. It worked so great, I had to buy one for my wife !! :) We both love them !I highly recommend, especially at deal price I saw last week, I paid around 180$ CAD for each of ours and it is REALLY worth every penny I invested !Very good pick ! You won't regret it !
"
"
Came quickly and packaged well.  The case is a little awkward not really a good fit for the brush.  the brush itself is amazing. I love the different modes and the app.  I would recommend this product.  My hygienist recommended this brush, I can’t wait for my next check up !!
"
"
This was a replacement for another, roughly 15 year old, Oral electric brush, that was still working fine mechanically, but some plastic was cracking around the drive shaft area, causing the brush to wiggle. For what it's worth, the batteries in the old brush were still good, with no signs of ""memory effect"", which in any case is a near myth.This brush is definitely better than my old brush, and yes, after brushing my teeth feel like I've just seen my dental hygienist. It's a couple of months until I see her, and get her opinion! My old brush only had a 2-minute timer, and this one's every 3- seconds timer does make me more aware of giving equal attention to all quadrants of my mouth. The added wireless display is ok, but in my opinion more of a gimmick than a real tool. Plus, in order to see it while brushing, it has to be mounted at eye-level near behind your sink, and that makes it near enough that with my poor eyesight I have to be wearing glasses while brushing, splashing toothpaste on them. So it is more a digital clock for my bathroom than an actual improvement on tooth-brushing.One criticism; the packaging could be a lot simpler, and less wasteful. Most of the content is air.

I have been using the oral B 7000 for about a month and I have to say I couldn't be more happy with the results. The different brush heads allow you to be your own little at home dentist and really hit all the problem areas. The gum massager is amazing and my teeth are noticeably whiter since using this brush.The timer helps give you great feed back on how you are doing while brushing and ensuring you are giving your teeth the proper time. I have never felt so strongly about a tooth brush, but this is one that every one must own. Our dental health should always be a top concern and this brush really does address every issue. It is well worth the money and will out perform any other toothbrush I guarantee you that.
"
"
We got this one to replace an older model that had the same Bluetooth time counter but it’s more expensive now. We could have paid less for the one that only uses the app but we don’t want to be data-mined as the privacy policy states would happen. I despise their business practices, but their toothbrush does a good job and lasts 4-5 years with 4 uses per day.

Good well made electric tooth brush, operates as described.Not sure of the pricing but since I purchased it from Amazon, it was $80 cheaper than buying itin a retail store here in Canada. I would also consider the Oral-B 5000 or even the Oral-B 4000,they have pretty much the same mechanics including battery life but less modes and cheaper travel cases.I would consider Amazon's price excellent from that perspective.Being that this is my third purchase of Oral-B electric tooth brushes, I can honestly saythat at the price quoted by Amazon is proportionately fair given the upgraded components.The reason why the 7000 costs more is because of such things as the quality travel case that is somuch better than the 5000  .... etc.Points I'm very happy with the 7000 .... 1 Great price compared to retail stores 2 Delivered to my door in two days 3 Great product 4 The wireless Smart Guide can be useful for timing your brushing  or it can be used as a clock alone for the bathroom 5 Quality travel case for both the handle and the chargerI would also like to say even though it is great electric brush my previous Oral-B brush had awall mountable charger which was great for not taking up space on the bathroom counter.Some other reviews of this brush noticed that as well.I don't know why that design was stopped but it was much appreciated by many purchasers of the Oral-B line.
"
"
First off, how important is your smile? Second, how often do you brush your teeth? Spending money on a tool that you should be using at least twice a day, for a physical attribute that typically defines you, seems like a worth while investment The Oral-B 7000 is worth it. I've come to realize that I've been brushing my teeth wrong up until this purchase. This tooth brush tells you whether you are brushing too hard and ensures you are brushing your teeth long enough. It does not get more convenient than that. I read all the reviews for multiple brushes prior to this purchase and with the exorbitant amount of positive reviews on the Oral-B, I had to give it a shot. I can genuinely say my teeth feel cleaner than they ever did. It feels like I just got cleaning done at the dentist every time I finish brushing my teeth now. It is a sturdy built brush versus some of the other competitors. Its longevity is to be seen but it feels and runs immaculately. It comes with a timer/clock that you attach to your mirror; if you share a bathroom this could be inconvenient but you do not have to mount it. It has an app that gives you feed back and a history of your brushing habits via bluetooth - some say overkill but I always enjoy seeing the data. I read reviews regarding the placement of the buttons being inopportune but I have had no issues. It comes with a chic travelling case as an added benefit. The brush itself is aesthetically pleasing and in the very least gives you some style points.(Oral-B needs some all black brush heads to complete the all black look) Performance, build, and look are all A+. Purchase this brush my friend, you can thank me afterwards.
"
"
Item is perfect.  Works like a charm. Minute module is giving you a nice follow-up of your brushing stage and bluetooth was a charm to synchronizeI tried the Phillips Sonicare and I much prefer this 7000.  I was not sure between the 8000 model and the 7000 model but I think I made the right choice in choosing the 7000 series with the  Smart Guide combine with the bluetooth app.
"
"
Our Oral B Triumph Professional Care Rechargeable stopped charging when placed back on the charging post unless you turned it around to force it to better connect.  So we looked for a replacement.  The reviews on the 7000 were very good and it appeared to have everything we had with the Triumph including one of my favorites - the Bluetooth Smartguide.  It will apparently hold a charge for much longer thus making it easier to take on vacation (although so far we have only taken it on a 3 day trip).  The hard cover travel case is nice and carries 2 brushes and the Power Brush (not the charging post however).  It has 7 different levels of brushing you can choose from.  After about 1 month of use, we are very happy with it.
"
"
The toothbrush works ok, however like the older models the performance is less than stellar unless you leave it constantly on the charger - which is bad for the battery. Oral-B should have long ago moved to a newer battery technology such as lithum ion or similar to address this problem. As a result, the toothbrush now works great when fully charged, but noticely slows down and performs not nearly as well once you've used it one or two times. This leaves your mouth feeling ""less clean"". For the price it should have a much better battery and I would not buy it again.
"
"
It does an amazing job of brushing your teeth. Your mouth has that “I just left the dentist "" feel. I like the timer it comes with. Plus the brushing options are very handy. I bought it on sale but I would gladly pay the actual price for it.
"
"
Excellente brosse a dent. J'utilise une brosse électrique depuis plus de 20 ans et j'ai d'excellente dents. Le seule point faible de cette brosse, est quelle est bruyante et j'aime pas les 'bip bip"" a chaque 30 sec. pour vous avisez de changer de côté. Je vais possiblement essayer la Philips la prochaine fois car elle a aussi de bons commentaires. Excellent brush tooth. I use an electric brush for over 20 years and have excellent teeth. The only weak point of this brush is what is noisy and I do not like the ""beep beep"" at every 30 sec. To notify you to change sides. I will possibly try Philips next time because it was also good comments.
"
"
Good toothbrush, works like is supposed to.  Battery life isn't that great but if you leave it in the cheaper than it is fine.  Charging takes a while but if you leave it over night it will be fine.  It comes with case, extra heads,  pouch, charger, holder for heads,  timer, and the brush.  This brush is great, much better than a manual toothbrush. The Bluetooth works fine just press one button and all the information goes to your phone. On the phone it gives alot of details.  I like how we can customize which mode comes next. I just wish it was cheaper.
"
"
Oral-B 7000 arrived well packaged. The unit is sleek in design and includes a separate timer. The timer is convenient and helpful to ensure you brush your mouth for a minimum prescribed two minutes. Staring directly at the timer isn't required because the unit will automatically change speeds once you've achieved two minutes. But a nice feature to have. Also included are easy to follow instructions, plus three starter brushing heads. If inclined, this unit is also Bluetooth compatible so you can track your dental hygiene regime. Love this unit. Pricey yes, but an excellent investment and well worth the cost. Your teeth feel super clean after each brushing.
"
"
This toothbrush is truly amazing. I find the app to be slightly laggy, however all-in-all, I am ecstatic as to how well this tooth brush works, especially the way it is constantly reminding me to floss (via the app), how it allows me to add my dentist appointments so it reminds me about them to the app, and also how I have it remind me to pay extra attention to trouble spots after my last cleaning at the dentist.If it weren't for the app being a bit laggy, I'd rate this product 5 stars.All-in-all though, I'd definitely buy it again.
"
"
This is one of the best buys for me in 2019. It's like discovering a car when you're used to a horse-carriage. I used to use a normal toothbrush and now I will never go back to using a normal one.The modes are great, I love the deep clean and tongue cleaner modes also the app is neat and simple to use.If you're thinking of upgrading this is not a bad place to begin. 5 stars
"
"
This is a fantastic toothbrush. As a new mom, brushing my teeth became a very rushed chore! Haha. Honestly this toothbrush has saved my gums because I was brushing too hard all the time. It has a sensor to tell you if you're brushing too hard. I wish I purchased sooner! Try to snag one on sale because it is so expensive. I also had an Amazon gift certificate. :) Enjoy!!
"
"
Bought this on PRIME day at about 35% off. Well worth the price I paid. Wished they had shipped it with more than 3 brush heads. Product works as advertised and no complaints. Got the family brushing more too!
"
"
Yes it's a pricy brush but it's worth it, especially if you have somewhat bad brushing habits, as I do. The reminders for when to change brush heads are very appreciated. I love the customized brushing and couldn't ask for more. Very cute travel case and bag that come with it too.

Pro:1. Fast twisting brush head has been proven to be the only effective cleaning brush.  With the tips showing on the LCD further helps improving its performance. 2. The 6 degree slanting makes the brush stronger when the consumer is taught to keep the brushes always ""kissing"" distance from the surface.  3.The quality other than the charger is 5 star grade.Con: 1. The length of the body can be shorter regardless the physical build of the consumer.  This brush is supposed to be a gift to my daughter and she hesitated to accept all because of its tallness. It is taller than the 2 Pxxxxxxxxx brands.  2. The consolidated cage for the brushes and the charger need a better design.  One brush will be shared by adult members of the family.  The brush heads after use are wet and should be kept standing so that they will become dry within minimal time.  Less chance for bacteria to find home there.  3. Should be more generous with the inexpensive color coding plastic rings.  Provide the set of 4 colors to even 3 pcs replacement set for identity.  4. The charger is not globally friendly.  It accepts only 110 and may be 120v.  This device is so luxuriously priced that leads to the assumption that consumers use it in 5 or 6 star hotels that provides dual voltage in their washrooms as standard.  Otherwise get oneself a voltage converter handy when travelling to 220 - 240v countries.  The designer mush bear in mind appreciating consumers will not fall back to hand held plastic brushes for any reason.  5. If the battery is not lithium, please have it updated as well.

Good electric toothbrush, cleans my teeth better than my old Braun one because the vibration is faster. Hope it lasts 13+ years like the old Braun. The timer divides the 2 minute brushing into 4 parts which is convenient and effective. The phone app is a bit infantile but I guess young kids would like it and adding incentive to brushing their teeth is more important than my already a habit brushing of my old teeth.
"
"
This is the second one I purchased, first one was for my husband and I was so jealous of how good it was I wanted one too. I purchased his a year ago so I can honestly say it has passed the test of time. I didn't think it would make much of a difference from my 5 year Oral B brush but I when I finish brushing it feels the same as when you have had your teeth cleaned at the dentist office.
"
"
Looks great, comes with a high quality travel case, has every brushing setting you could need. Bluetooth is a gimmick, but the clock/timer it's connected to is awesome! The battery last for around a week which is great, but it takes a long time to charge... Also the blue light is crazy bright.I feel like the price is a bit steep for what it is though... In comparison to the cheaper models it doesn't really make sense to pay this much for a toothbrush. If it goes on sale, it's a solid option.
"
"
Ça nettoie en profondeur comme si on allait chez le dentiste à chaque jour. Il y a moins de dépôt de tartre. La durée de la charge de la batterie dure environ 8 à 9 jours pour 3 brossages par jour de 2 minutes.It deep cleans like going to the dentist every day. There is less tartar deposit. The duration of the charge of the battery lasts approximately 8 to 9 days for 3 brushings per day of 2 minutes.
"
"
I've got really​ clean teeth with this amazing toothbrush. Removes plaque does an amazing job! definitely get your money's worth with it.
"
"
Just got the package on Wednesday (shipped out on Monday).  So far, it is everything as described and one of the best prices I have seen anywhere (retail or online).  I have been a fan of Oral B electronic toothbrushes for many many years and I figure to upgrade to the top of the line.  I do not expect Oral B to fail me and very grateful the deals and services Amazon.ca can provide me.
"
"
The Wi-Fi connectivity is really redundant.  If you track your brushing stats on your smart phone past the first 3 weeks of owning this brush, you need a hug, and some friends.  Beyond that, it's still just a (good) electric toothbrush.
"
"
I’ve had this product since 2016 and I’m extremely satisfied. The cleaning action is amazing, and my teeth look like they’ve gotten a professional cleaning every time I brush.I’ve been quite negligent lately when it comes to dental hygiene; I’ve gone weeks without brushing; this device has allowed my teeth to heal and become healthy again.
"
"
I'ts way more than anybody needs in a tooth brush. I got it for the sale price so why not get the flagship right? I dont use the bluetooth at all, i could see it being helpfull for children learning to brush properly but its more than ill ever need. It comes with extra brush heads but no dual actions :( they are about $25 for 3 and are a far superior brush head. At the end of the day its  an electric toothbrush, does whats it's suppose to do. Definatly an upgrade from my manual brush and it comes with a sweet travel case, like the one Dexter has for his tranquilizer seringe! :D
"
"
Awesome for travelling, went away for a week with 2 out of 3 battery and lasted the whole week. Boyfriend had the black one but I like the white so it doesn't show much slop and spit on it after brushing lol
"
"
Great toothbrush, too bad I can't just leave it there. Way too much fancy packaging, carrier bags, etc. You throw away more than you keep. Ridiculous in this day and age that companies still need to go overkill on the packaging. I hardly think that all that extra fluff sells more toothbrushes.
"
"
My teeth feel clean, the tooth brush work just fine. The app is glitchy so I just gave up on it. Probably would opt for a cheaper model without Bluetooth connection if I were to buy again
"
"
I started to notice my teeth required extra flossing after using this brush. It does not clean between the teeth at all. And because the brush head is small, toothpaste gathers in between the bristles giving the brush head a dirty look 🤢. Had to soak the heads in baking soda/water long before they required replacing. Don’t recommend this product.
"
"
Honestly. Reviewing a toothbrush..... but wow this thing is amazing. Cant go wrong. Will do a week of brushing without seeing another charge. So excellent for short trips somewhere
"
"
The product is very gimmicky and didn't provide any extra value. I have a pretty decent phone, but the app still felt clunky. Just get a normal electric toothbrush, you'll be better off. There's some cool ones which kill bacteria with UV rays. Its a decent toothbrush but definitely not worth the money.
"
"
It’s ergonomic, beautiful design, settings are all nice, cleans teeth perfectly!Large and heavy to travel with.Battery doesn’t last for long, as the battery is draining the strength of the brushing decreases. Always keep fully charged for best cleaning!
"
"
Don't really use the Bluetooth but the brush and settings are great. Travel case is awesome as well. Probably find a cheaper brush that would do the same things.
"
"
It does a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth; they feel like I've just been to the dentist.  I like the separate timer.  It's a great improvement over having a timer on the handle where you couldn't see it.  The timer also picks up where it left off if you pause and restart while brushing.  One complaint: the blue LED that indicates charging is extremely bright.  We found it too bright even with our bathroom door closed.  There's enough light to be annoying even through the cracks around the door, especially because it flashes off and on.  We now leave it off the charger at night and only charge during the day, which is a simple enough solution to not deduct a star.
"
"
I like the overall of the product, the battery is good, the travel set, the timer in the mirror. But so  Disappointed with the Bluetooth because the Apps need to be open to register all information from the toothbrush’s. I don’t always bring my phone in the bathroom especially when I take shower then brush my teeth.
"
"
This is my first time purchasing a Oral-B toothbrush and I like the way it operates. First time charge can take up to 24 hrs. I've had this for about 2 weeks now and I like the job its doing.
"
"
I bought it to replace my sonic toothbrush that broke after a few years of use and am very pleased.  This toothbrush in my opinion does a much better job at brushing than my old one.  The only thing I really don't care about is the Bluetooth.  I wish I could have bought the same model without Bluetooth connectivity.
"
"
Seems to clean well, the brush modes and timer should be more correlated... unsure of the battery as I haven't let it drain and leave it on the charger after every brush.
"
"
Nothing but good things to say, both the charger and toothbrush have lasted over a year with no issues, the carrying case is perfect and the replacement brushes are sold in every retailer.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Always been a fan on the Oral-B toothbrushes. Owned the Triumph series previously.This seems to be a revamped version of it, with some minor updates.Generally expensive, but i got it on sale.But i am happy with it because of my satisfaction with the Triumph series. I can definitely appreciate the difference as compared to a manual toothbrush. It's difficult for me to compare to other electric toothbrushes as i have never owned any other brand
"
"
The produce meets expectation. The timer requires batteries that must be replaced often. It comes with 2 extra heads, one with soft bristles. Travel case feels like it is well made, good for traveling. If you purchase white, prepare to get the case dirty. Battery charge on the toothbrush lasts about 5 days, takes 48 hours to have a complete charge.Liquid will seep through brush head and touch the metal prong that vibrates the bristles.Overall -  purchased on recommendation of dentist since my teeth are unnaturally prone to stains. For 200, it is a good investment if you have the money for it.Recommend by dental hygienist to use Colgate optic white toothpaste and mouth rinse with it.
"
"
Fine toothbrush.  Have used them for years and this model does not disappoint.  Designed and manufactured in Germany!!!  Do not see many products built outside China these days, despite Chinese citizen's deaths due to pollution.That being said, I replaced my last one (a model 4000) because the battery gave erratic service after about three (3) years of use.  I am not complaining, although it would be advantageous to be able to purchase just the battery pack.  Alas, it not available.Lastly, Bluetooth.  It will not work unless your device is fitted with Bluetooth 4.  If this is not the case, you will not be able to 'pair' the toothbrush.
"
"
I just bought the tooth brush and on the first day of arriving the tooth brush won’t even charge it’s been almost 3 days and I’ve done everything to try to get it to charge but I got nothing don’t buy this product until amazon gets this issue fixed. Unless you want to have a $168 gone from you account.
"
"
Something went wrong with the charger within a year. But due to a family tradgey I missed the year warranty and got  the run around by Oral B.I had a model from eight years ago which is why I bought this one, and the price was excellent.
"
"
I love the toothbrush as better than my old oral-b one. The only downside at the moment sinceI just bought it August 12/17 is the Bluetooth technology. So far the app refuses to recognizeMy toothbrush. Hopefully Oral- b can resolve my issue as working on it. The main reasonI purchased this technology.
"
"
Find it a bit loud but this is also my first electric toothbrush... The timer on it makes brushing easier and almost a challenge to keep my teeth cleaner than with a manual. For the first time in my life, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.
"
"
Toothbrush defintely gives you the 'Dentist Treatment'. In addition the timer and toothbrush are in sync for 30sec intervals. Battery lasts long, and I brush past the 2mins (daily). App could use more work but overall great quality for a month, hopefully it sustains the effectiveness for a few years.
"
"
Never seem my wife so happy to receive this tooth brush after her 1000 stopped working. She just loves it and I'm a hero for getting it for her as a gift.
"
"
THE SMARTGUIDE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. MY OLD ORAL B (WITH SMART GUIDE) WORKS WITH THE NEW ONE TOO.
"
"
I am in love with this electric toothbrush!It cleans very well!I never had an electric toothbrush! I do not know about others products in the market, but this one I do recommend!
"
"
Bought this as a birthday gift for my mother. She thinks it's great. She didn't really want Bluetooth (she doesn't own a smart phone) but the sale price made it even less expensive than the lesser models. I really don't see the point of having Bluetooth in a toothbrush anyway. People want an effective electric toothbrush not a monthly report on how much they brush! Quite silly really.
"
"
Something wrong with this. It has a red indicator light if you push ""too hard"" on your teeth and slows down the motor. When I put my Oral B brush head on the handheld it goes red and slows the motor down everytime I brush. I don't understand.... Such a waste of money.
"
"
OK.  Inclus des bébelles non nécessaires.exemple: l'affichage bluetooth ne dit pas si on se brosse les dents une fois par jour ou une fois par mois..  L'affichage pourrait dire l'heure et la date du brossage.  L'étuit de voyage ???.  Je m'en servirai pour ma brossse de voyage.
"
"
Lots of stuff comes with this toothbrush!  It’s easy to use and does a great job.  I have limited space around my sink so unfortunately there’s not a lot of space for the brush head and toothbrush holder but I have adapted!
"
"
The protective cover for the timer is the wrong way round. And if i clip it on, it blocks the time behind it making it useless.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is fantastic. Having a pressure sensor and timer really keeps a person honest.The app is pretty flakey, like 2 star flakey. But since you don't need the app to run the brush I give it 5 stars.
"
"
You can’t go wrong with this product it’s so convenient and my last oral b lasted 8yrs!
"
"
I have used a few of the Oral B tooth brushes over the past few years. This one is the best one by far. I got it on sale last year right around Black Friday, so if they do the same this year it is well worth the money.
"
"
I purchased this a few weeks ago, I like it but honestly it's not worth spending so much ($180+) for a toothbrush. If I had to purchase an electric toothbrush again, I'd buy one with the same features except the fact that it's connected (pretty useless) for ~$80.
"
"
The overall quality of this toothbrush is excellent and the happy face visual timer is a great tool especially from my young son. It helps him do a full brush in all areas of his mouth. I have not used the Bluetooth app but will be doing that soon to help him track his brushing daily.
"
"
Haven’t used the Bluetooth feature extensively, but as a toothbrush this thing is amazing.
"
"
Je l'aie depuis quelques semaines et je ne pourrais plus m'en passer.
"
"
The product comes complete with everything you need to get started. Cleaning performance, when fully charged, is excellent. However, mine starts losing power after six minutes of use; two sessions of three minutes with two minutes using normal and one minute of polishing setting. Recharging the unit takes between 12 and 24 hours. This is disappointing given its price.
"
"
I'm never going back to using a manual toothbrush! This is simply beautiful, I've never felt a fresher mouth, not to mention it syncs with your phone, pushing you towards your goal (you can set a whitening goal through the app and you follow the planned brushing for 2 weeks and.. boom! Whitest smile ever!)
"
"
I bought this product so that I could track my brushing habits thinking that I could not do that with the same unit as my spouse. The problem is that the smart guide does not recognize mine as a different unit and picks up my spouse’s brush time.
"
"
Works wonders. So many settings and so accurate. I use to brush my teeth for 5 minutes thinking that it was good. Then I found out I was over brushing and this toothbrush helped fixed that with its timer.
"
"
Exceptional quality. Easy to set up and start using. Good power and good battery strength.
"
"
Looks good, well made but not sure a person really needs all the bells and whistles for the price
"
"
I've been using this toothbrush for about 2 or 3 years now. Works great, the app was a bit buggy, but not necessary as the toothbrush will vibrate when you need to switch quadrants.
"
"
Amazing product, has so much extra thing I done use but I like to have them incase I do wsnt to use them, awesome for ppl with sensitive gums
"
"
This is simply the best toothbrush I've ever owned. The carrying case make it great for short trips, and the selection of brush heads and brush modes make this an all around amazing way to maintain or improve your oral health.
"
"
Product seems very well designed and reasonably priced.Works well and has many well thought out features adding to its high level of quality.
"
"
I bought Oral B 7000 because I was damaging my gums from brushing to hard, this has a sensor that shows when I brush to hard. The most important part is how my teeth feel so clean like just like being cleaned by the dentist.
"
"
A++ Work as expected. Still holding after 1 year and 7 month of heavy use (family of 4). LCD segments are starting to fade on SmartGuide but still readable.
"
"
Really disappointed, received this product with items missing and electric toothbrush not charging/ working.
"
"
Works great I particularly like the timing function. Brushes clean very well and when completed I feel my teeth and mouth are very clean. I would strongly recommend this product.
"
"
The Oral 7000 is a very good brush in that it's easy to use. Charge it, ensure the timer has batteries, push power button and the timer starts counting seconds. The brush starts on high frequency and after every 30 seconds the frequency moves down one level. The fact that I see the timer intuitively makes me brush longer as long as I'm not in a hurry. One thing I really like is if I brush too hard as in pressing too hard, a red light goes on to warn you.

Works great but full retail pricing is a bit steep for what you are getting.  I managed to purchase on Black Friday for a significant price reduction over regular retail pricing.
"
"
Cette brosse a dents fonctionne sans failles, sa recharge est plutôt longue => 6 heures. Je la conseille car elle à remplacé 2 brosses a dents d'un modèle inférieure de la même compagnie.
"
"
This item came repack. all the content seem to be new but the packaging was not the best. Maybe I caught a returned product that hasn't been used.
"
"
The battery is not lasting as long as it’s predicted to according to the manual .  Might get five or six days at 2×2 minute brushings a day – but there could’ve been some damage/freezing in transit. Not sure
"
"
Really enjoy this app based toothbrush.  My teeth feel like I was at the dentist getting a cleaning after it was done .  Definitely recommend to anyone who has teeth problems!
"
"
Love these toothbrushes! Highly recommended!
"
"
Excellent product - Far better than the last Gen of this model -works without using the app perfectly, not needed as I do not want my I phone in the Bathroom just asking for trouble.
"
"
I use it for almost about one month, everything is well, not find any problem. I have not make it clear that the how to use the discount card wich is bing at the same product mailbox, and why not have a chinese language booklet?
"
"
Great toothbrush but they should tell you how the smart guide clock works. They're two tiny buttons inside the clock where the batteries are to set the time. I prefer the actual app. Love that but my husband likes the smart guide.
"
"
I loved my new toothbrush very easy to use and it does its job very well, it reaches places where basic toothbrushes do not reach. I would buy it without hesitation
"
"
Great toothbrush. I had an earlier model from about 7 years ago that no longer lasted more than a day or two. This one lasts and provides a truly refreshing mouthfeel every day. Your mouth will feel as fresh as your last visit to the dentist.
"
"
Fancy carrying case, great quality, as expected from Oral B. Mounted the clock/timer in the shower which is really handy.
"
"
Lots of power in this model. Smart phone setup is easy but if you miss syncing with your phone the app thinks you didn't brush your teeth when in fact you did.
"
"
just over three months old and it stopped working. will not charge, just blinks on the charger.
"
"
love this toothbrush. works well. makes my mouth feel like I've just been at the dentist. charging time is a quite long, hence the 4 stars, not 5.
"
"
I am very happy with this purchase.  I noticed a huge improvement over my old electric toothbrush immediately.  Teeth feel much cleaner and it seems to last longer.Pricey but I found it on sale so it wasn't as bad.
"
"
Après moins d un an la pile tient moins sa charge
"
"
The toothbrush is good, the software is not that great. The cool thing is that it has an sdk and you can write your own apps, looking forward to play around with that.
"
"
Cleans really well, easy to use, can’t believe I haven’t been brushing with this all my life. Love it!
"
"
Super bonne brosse à dent, je ne retournerais plus jamais à une brosse ordinaire, les effets sont immédiats et impressionnants ! J'adore, j'ai l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste chaque fois que je me brosse les dents :D
"
"
High tech tooth care, great !!
"
"
Arrived as described!
"
"
Excellent machine totally satisfied, should have purchased one years ago, way easier and better than a manual tooth brush, however, ensure you look for sale pricing.
"
"
excellent produit. j'aime beaucoup.
"
"
Works as described
"
"
Awesome toothbrush works great use it every day
"
"
Great product. as described. and good quality. would buy again.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
Love it!!! Great product for the whole family!!
"
"
Great product cleans well
"
"
Works great, exactly how I thought. Happy with the purchase.
"
"
Great toothbrush. Would never go back to a manual. Love the look and feel of it, and it leaves your teeth feeling dentist clean.The travel case is a great feature too. Very sturdy. Wish it incorporated the charger however.
"
"
Works great and does the job. Powerful.
"
"
I bought this rechargeable toothbrush in November 2015. It is now early September 2016 and the charger no longer works! It has only been 9 months.  WTF.  I deserve to have a working charger and I expect better from Oral B.  I gave it a generous 2 stars.
"
"
So far so good.
"
"
I don’t like the battery, it’s only last for one week. But everything else are good. The power and the features are good.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush but the bluetooth light stays on all the time (flashing on & off)It might be disturbing if your bathroom is connected to your bedroom.Braun needs to fix this blinking light issue
"
"
Received great customer service with this product.The features are great and you can feel the difference using this toothbrush compared to a normal manual toothbrush.
"
"
Love it. Highly recommend.
"
"
This toothbrush is an excellent product and well worth the cost. It replaces the Oral-B Braun toothbrush that lasted almost twenty years. Travels well too.
"
"
I’ve used this for 3 months. It’s a bit expensive but it does a great job.
"
"
Was a gift for my husband. He loves it. Has been using it for over 2 years and super happy about it
"
"
This is a excellent toothbrush.  Couldn't get anything better for the price that's forsure.
"
"
The tooth brush is working very well until The battery died after  6 months.  Impossible to get in touch with amazon.ca which was the seller to replace it.
"
"
Pas encore utiliserMa 5000 fonctionne encore
"
"
We love our electric toothbrush!!! It travels well and the battery life is long!!
"
"
I feel like my teeth are super clean every time I use it.
"
"
Ive been using Oral-B for years but this clean feels just like i got back from the dentist. So if you're reading this you can, or almost afford the extra cost of the 7000. You won't be disappointed. Oral-B  even has a money back guarantee. Enjoy
"
"
Affordable
"
"
I love this! I've been using it for the last few months and can't imagine going back to a regular toothbrush. Feels like I've been at the dentist every time I brush :) fast delivery. thank you
"
"
Love the feel of my teeth after cleaning
"
"
Ma premiere bross electick... Tres efficace, je fais beaucoup beaucoup b... de tartre et depuis la brosse 90 % moins..  Je ne sais pas si moins cher serai aussi bon??? Je n'ai jamais eu d'autre pour comparer..je vous recommande celle là.
"
"
Fontionne bien.Réponds à mes attentes
"
"
Quick delivery, a good product and a great deal.  Fancy for a toothbrush but love it so far.
"
"
WoW génial! Vraiment moins cher qu’ailleur et va vraiment bien!
"
"
le bluetooth est un peu gadget avec l'application pour mobile... mais autrement entièrement satisfait du produit
"
"
Just like going to the Dentists!  I now spend on average from 3 to 5 minutes brushing.  Fabulous product. Wish I had purchased years ago.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Quick delivery without any problems. After trying a few electric toothbrushes before, this one is the best to keep my teeth almost as clean as after a visit to the dentist. Excellent quality and functionality.
"
"
I feel like I've come from the dentist on a daily basis
"
"
I'm an Oral B fan anyway but love my new Oral B Precision Black 7000 electric toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and are certainly whiter.  My only complaint is that the brushes that were included with the toothbrush are not labelled so it's been trial and error as to which brush I should use for which purpose. .  I would highly recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
Teeth feel so clean.
"
"
Hands down. Best toothbrush ever. powerful.good battery life. definitely makes you feel like you got your moneyS worth of a brush. only downfall as mentioned before is it takes a good 24 hours for a full charge...if you need a quick brush before.u go throw.it on for 20 mins for a quick clean
"
"
This is the natural evolution of teeth cleaning, There are a variety of modes to choose from and the Charge last forever and ever.
"
"
Charges quickly, works well, very powerful.The rotating head is especially great for cleaning around permanent ortho wires :)
"
"
Product arrived as expected. Have been using it since and quite satisfactory results. Price OK as I later found out London Drugs is selling at similar price. Could have got it at London Drugs without waiting for shipping.
"
"
Battery doesn't last one month, takes over 8hrs to charge and only lasts 1 week. Makes horrible noises when brushing
"
"
Nothing to complain about except receiving an outdated coupon for 3$ off dates 07/31/2018.  Great product!
"
"
Very good product
"
"
kid loves it, brushes forever
"
"
The toothbrush is well-designed with pressure control, so that you won’t press it so hard to your teeth. Feel great when using it!
"
"
Love this. Never realized how great this was over a manual brush
"
"
Excellent brush
"
"
Sure makes your teeth whiter
"
"
like a lot.
"
"
Love our toothbrush. I thought my teeth were clean until I tried this! Now they are clean! Wife and I both love it.
"
"
Have only used it for a short while but it was a great buy.  Very pleased with it so far.
"
"
Great brush, works really well.
"
"
Tel que décrit !
"
"
What a powerful tool for me ! Cleaning become very easy !! I strongly recommand !
"
"
Within the 1st day, both my fiance and myself had smoother and noticeably whiter teethby following the customizable teeth cleaning plan provided by oral b free app.
"
"
I had doubts about expensive ones but got it on sale.it is leagues above the 30 dollar version.Bluetooth was unnecessary though, I don't ever use it.
"
"
Girlfriend enjoy it
"
"
It's expensive but works as advertised.
"
"
The best toothbrush .
"
"
great brush but has waaaay more options than we'll ever use. i would probably just buy the cheaper version if i were to do it again.
"
"
A little overpriced but it is a great toothbrush. If you don't need the Bluetooth and the travel case I recommend getting a cheaper version.
"
"
Very happy with its performance. Just what I would expect from Oral B. Battery life excellent. Just can't understand why I need Bluetooth compatibility.
"
"
I am really disappointed with this brush.  Although I really liked using it, after 5 months it just stopped charging.
"
"
Replaced my 8 year old Oral B toothbrush. Super happy with the improvement in technology. The pressure sensor is great
"
"
Nice toothbrush but the Bluetooth function is not evolved enough in my opinion. Still it's nice have a reminder every 30 sec to change side and to brush for at least 2min
"
"
Works greats
"
"
Amazing machine. My teeth feel as if I had just stepped out of the dentist office. I would recommend to anyone.
"
"
Love itLots of power.Best brush ive ever had
"
"
Gggggrrrrrrreeeeeeaaaaaaaaatttttttt
"
"
I have used this for over a year now still like new
"
"
Brosse à dents électrique sans fil d’une grande efficacité
"
"
great product. Many features I have not even begun to explore, but various settings are fantastic
"
"
it is very useful product for everyone. delivery was very good . but the product is a little noisy that i didn't expect it.
"
"
Dentist recommended this.  Works very well.  It was bought to replace an older model that lasted 8 years.
"
"
An excellent device. I have been having difficulty with food particles getting stuck. I have a more conventional electric brush but it wasn't doing the job. This one does. I only wish the local store carried a better stock of replaceable heads.
"
"
Love itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove itLove it

Amazing toothbrush and I couldn't be happier with it! Won't be going back to a normal toothbrush again!

excellent toothbrush..next day shipping..thnaks
"
"
battery could last longer but it's still good (we are two using it)
"
"
Loud
"
"
This is amazing! Wish I bought one years ago. It literally erases years of stains in just a few weeks
"
"
Liked thatbitvtimes brushing and tracks by day
"
"
Excellent product ! 5 *
"
"
Love this tooth brush! Half the price on Amazon than anywhere else and it's the perfect replacement for an old model which I've had for 7 years. The battery is only starting to not hold a charge now.
"
"
This toothbrush has lots of settings, works very well.  I love the wall monitor.  Highly recommended.
"
"
What's More Important your teeth or 180 bucks your choiceI Love Mine
"
"
As good as expected, my husband likes it.
"
"
Amazing
"
"
I had the Philips diamond clean before the Precision 7000 and the Oral B cleans your teeth much better.
"
"
Great product at a discount price! Verified the authenticity with Oral B! Edges of the box were worn out but otherwise everything fine.
"
"
Quieter than the previous version.
"
"
Good quality, powerful, stylish, well worth the $$. No complaints so far.
"
"
Totally lives up to my expectations and more.  The remote timer and pressure sensor are great features.  The timer is a little diffilcult to set up and the pressure sensor could be more sensitive but these are minor setbacks in a great product
"
"
PRODUCT WAS SENT OPENED - PLASTIC WRAP WAS ABSENT SO IT WAS NOT USABLE. THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE THIS ORAL HYGIENE PRODUCT HAD NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH OR USED.
"
"
Good Tooth brush
"
"
feeling better clean mouth as compared to before but after sometime I found my sensor thing is getting corrosion on it.so I m not happy with the hat at all.
"
"
My wife and I love the brush. Still no cavities.
"
"
I have only used for a few days and so far, it is great.  I could not warrant full marks yet as longevity and the battery effectiveness has not yet had time to prove itself.
"
"
Very powerful and keeps a charge for about a week
"
"
Works great. My teeth feel a lot cleaner after using it for the last two weeks.
"
"
Battery is not working. Does not hold a charge and sometimes will not charge at all.
"
"
Conforme aux attentes, très bien.
"
"
Quick to charge, easy to use, good instructions, definitely worth the money
"
"
tres satisfait
"
"
The box it came in was ripped!! It was a Christmas gift, other than that we'll find out when she gets to use it I guess !!!
"
"
The combination of the timer and the pressure sensor changed the way I brush.  Props both from me and my dental hygienist.
"
"
modes are not quite useful except regular, a bit too expensive, otherwide all good
"
"
Up to Oral B's normal standards and the Bluetooth timer and brushing quality indicator is great.
"
"
I love my new toothbrush. It does everything it promised to do. I love the timer and the graphic that tells me if I have spent enough time in each area of my mouth. I highly recommend it to everyone. ​
"
"
Great great
"
"
Battery died after 1 month of use. Will not charge. Lame for 200 bucks. Returning this dollar store trash
"
"
This toothbrush is amazing how well it cleans your teeth and your teeth feel like you have just had a cleaning at the dentist's.  This toothbrush is expensive but it is definitely worth it and I would highly recommend you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
"
"
Very nice!
"
"
Very large and clunky, the vibration was so strong it made my brain rattle.
"
"
This is a very good product, I hope that it proves reliable in the long term, given Braun's reputation for poor quality, I do have some concerns.
"
"
Absolutely love this toothbrush. Would highly recommend.
"
"
Good
"
"
Shipping rapide, elle marche super bien ! Meme pour ma petite fille elle va super bien !
"
"
Great toothbrush. Removes majority of plaque from teeth, but usually end up going above the 2 min recommended time to remove it all.
"
"
the brush works well. too many unnecessary bells and whistles
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent électrique compatible avec plusieurs sortes de brosse .
"
"
Everything is great, it's just not as quiet as the other ones I've had
"
"
Perfect gift
"
"
Excellent toothbrush, my teeth are better brush and more cleaner.

Made in Germany, amazing quality, very happy to have one
"
"
This is the best toothbrush ever. I tried them all.
"

The bluetooth function is useless, I'd rather use some thing simple and easy.
"
"
Great purchase! As described.
"
"
La brosse a différentes vitesses de nettoyage, très pratique
"
"
Loved this toothbrush. Grt looking and great performance.
"
"
best brush ever !!! must have ! clean sensation, small enough to go everywhere, easy to use even kids love it !!!
"
"
So disappointing - it stopped charging after only 1 month of use. It doesn't work anymore. I had another Braun power rush that lasted me 10 years.
"
"
good
"
"
easy to use
"

Excellent item. I love it.

"

Nothing to dislike, use it for over twenty years.
"
"
Super
"
"
Quick Shipping, best toothbrush i have ever used

BON PRODUIT
"
"
One of the best I have ever used.
"
"
Feels like you've just come from the dentist. Love it.
"
"
This product is awesome
"
"
Found brush big, stalls easily, and dripping down the handle. Not a favourite.
"
"
Easy set up. Feels like heaven
"
"
Toothbrush works great
"
"
very good
"
"
Works awesome. Really nice on the teeth and gums. Lots of options and nice case for storage. Would highly recommend.
"
"
Love it, the product comes fast. Feeling different on the first try. Highly recommend
"
"
Works perfectly
"
"
Bon produit et répond à mes attentes.
"
"
Probably a defective
"
"
very nice product, very useful, great for everyone
"
"
Best toothbrush I've owned. A little over priced? Maybe, but I don't regret it.
"
"
Best toothbrush I have ever had.
"
"
Meets expectations but has limited features related to advanced guidance beyond keeping track of your basic oral health statistics.
"
"
Exactly as advertized
"
"
Perfect
"
"
Superbe brosse à dents électrique.Malheureusement, malgré ce qui est affiché sur le site, cette brosse à dents n'est pas compatible avec l'application Bluetooth. Très déçu.
"
"
J'ai jamais eut les dents si propre, j'aime beaucoup et je le recommande sans hésiter.
"
"
Runs well for several days (5-7, or more) on a full charge.  The monitor helps users to spend enough time brushing, to do an effective job.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
i like an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Rien de négatif sur le produit
"
"
Does the job!
"
"
Very effective and the timer makes me do a better brushing.
"
"
Great product, my dental hygienist has noted the difference!
"
"
Exactement comme décrit.
"
"
Works great, battery life is pretty disappointing for a ""high-end"" model though. Takes roughly 24 hours to fully charge from dead each time.
"
"
Love it man, so good, have to buy it to understand what im talking about so good, it cleans so blessed, looooooove it....!!!!!!
"
"
I didn't even realize it when buying but this is the Fitbit of toothbrushes!
"
"
good
"
"
Works well
"
"
This is a great product. Handles perfectly, holds the charge as described. Works very well.
"
"
I love this thing! Makes me excited to brush my teeth everyday!
"
"
Very happy. Have been using it for the past 2 week and have noticed a that I am not developing as much plaque as I use to.
"
"
très bon produit a date  ,pas de problème a utiliser
"
"
it is great, but you are better to wait for big discounts.... sometimes it could be around $130
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned! My teeth feel ""dentist"" clean ever time I use it.
"
"
Excellent produit
"
"
Good toothbrush, mouth is nice and fresh, but travel is case is soooo heavy!
"
"

Teeth never feel this clean after using it! Love it!
"

Great unit! Love the 30 second interval timer. New brushes take a bit of getting used to, but all in all a very happy customer.
"
"
Works well. Im already seeing and feeling a difference in how clean my teeth feel.
"
"
Perfect product and fast delivery, already used it for a year, love it!

It's good, but the price is a little bit higher than the product itself
"
"
The battery does not last long enough. Other functions are good
"
"
All is good
"
"
After the first time I've used it, it felt like I've just come out of the Dentist office after I had my teeth cleaned.  It brushes very well.
"
"
Fantastic product  - really notice a difference from using a manual toothbrush.
"
"
Would buy again, fast response quick delivery good price! 10/10!!

Pretty useful and provides better experience than Philips' product
"
"
Very good product
"
"
So easy to use and you know when your brushing to hard. Just love it. Travel case is really usable.
"
"
This is the best tool I have found for oral health.
"
"
I like it very much, no complaints.
"
"
Cleans teeth just as good as the dental hygienist.
"
"
Works well. But not much of difference from the basic oral b. I have used both.
"
"
Perfect so far
"
"
Great product!
"
"
Feels like coming back from the dentist. I love it!!!
"
"
a great product, and the price on Amazon was amazing
"

The BEST electric toothbrush on the market.

I have never felt the need or drive to write a review of a product before as I haven't truly had due cause to, but I made an exception with the Oral B Precision 7000. This item was delivered to me on May 19 and literally 2 months to the day, the battery stopped taking and holding a charge effectively rendering this ELECTRIC toothbrush utterly useless. I had read a few grumblings about battery issues when I was researching the toothbrush and now I'm sorry I didn't heed the warnings.If a consumer pays a premium price for what's marketed as a premium product, then quality should match expectations. Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this toothbrush. I followed the instructions where it stated to allow the battery to completely deplete at least once every month which is what got me here in the first place. I have had the toothbrush on its charging base for over 24 hours now and while the charging lights are running through their illumination cycle, once I turn it on, it runs for 3 seconds and the amber ""low battery"" light flashes.I had also noticed in the two months leading up to this point that the power/intensity of the toothbrush was noticeably weaker and dropped off after the first brush on a new charge. Considering they market it as having a 10 day battery, I'd say that's wholly misleading. The battery never lasted longer than 4 to 5 days.I can't in good conscience recommend this product. If you're torn between the Oral B and the Philips Sonicare, go with the Philips.I will be contacting Braun for a replacement, but their reputation has taken a hit in my eyes.

After using my first electric toothbrush for the past 2.5 months I'm ready to rate this at an average 3 stars... meaning a product with good potential and a one major shortcoming: the battery system. It's been said a few times already but you only get to understand after some use. Be prepared to recharge this more often then advertised.After 2.5 months I found that on average you get approx 7 days of 2 minutes, twice daily from full 3 blue bars charged to dead... but you need to know that the battery discharges rapidly from the said 3 blue bars to 2 blue bars then 1 blue bar then it changes the colour. I found that most of the operation is spent in the lower 1 bar and as it does so the speed and frequency of the moves / vibrations decreases... This is so noticeable that you may be inclined to re-charge it before discharging fully and thus reduce the number of battery cycles and product life span.One other note is about the wireless display which I plan to stop using. It links by radio waves with the toothbrush, brings up the happy face circle segments as you brush and gives you 5 full stars if you brush more then planned. It also uses battery power by itself and consumes toothbrush battery to do the radio communication when in use. Honestly I do not find much benefit from this display unless you need an extra time piece to stick to your bathroom wall. It may train you in brushing better if you haven't done it ever but... would trade it immediately for a better, higher capacity battery.

Came to this brush from a six year old Philips Flexcare. I wanted to buy a new Philips Sonicare brush but this was on sale for a great price due to Black Friday deal so I figured ""why not"" and purchased it. If you're coming from a manual brush, this would definitely be an improvement, but this is by far not top of the line.Things I noticed:- After switch from Philips to Oral-B, my teeth began losing their whiteness and plaque started to develop. No changes whatsoever in my brushing and flossing routine, the food I ate or the drinks I drank and even the water I brushed with stayed the same. Strike one.- The toothbrush is unnecessarily large. The carrying case was the size of my toiletry bag almost. The brush itself didn't fit comfortably in the hand.- You need to use the little display screen if you want to know what mode you're in. Because why would it make sense for them to put a display on the brush so you know what brushing mode you've selected?- Who the hell needs Bluetooth on their toothbrush, seriously.Furthermore, this brush (comparing MSRP) is more expensive than the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean, but there are numerous independent studies that rate the DiamondClean as being nearly twice as effective than the Oral-B Precision 7000 in a variety of criteria. If I recall correctly, the only category that the Oral-B brush won on was gum depth, which is something that can be affected by regular flossing.If you're going to drop bills on a new toothbrush, look away and check out Philips' products.(This may have got two stars instead of one if Oral-B's customer care didn't royally [edited] me off. One week with no email response, an hour and a half on hold [with the wrong number apparently, thanks to Oral-B's Twitter gurus] and an angry Tweet-conversation and they still didn't help me as much as Amazon did in <6 minutes)
"
"
I have been using this toothbrush for about 6 months now. I upgraded from a sonic care E. I have to say I am very pleased with this. It is very powerful and cleans your teeth very well. I also really like that it buzzes every 30 seconds so you know to switch what part of your mouth to brush even if you are not looking at the included display or a Bluetooth cellphone. Everything feels solid and very well made even the travel case.If I had to find a con I would say the LED charging light is to bright. If you brush your teeth right before bed your ensuite will glow bright blue.
"
"
Recieved package today. Smart Guide only displays half of information (top half of display works, bottom half dead). Do I need to return the whole package (rather not) or can the vendor send me another Smart Guide?
"
"
I bought this at just sub $200 because my last gen Oral B had rusted in the shaft.I bought it in June 2014 and by September 2014,the new one was rusting as well.Amazon was good enough to provide a new one in September(not P and G,the manufacturer)so,good on Amazon.The jury is still out as to whether the new toothbrush's so called stainless steel shaft will remain rust free or not. I consider the rusting of that shaft a health and safety issue.If it remains rust free,a fine power toothbrush and if it is durable say for 5 or more years without rusting or experiencing some other defect,could be a good thing.
"
"
Update: Recieved the replacement really quick, only 1 day wait. Received what is clearly a refurbished replacement.- garbage inside the box- toothbrush heads are all opened- time device has water stains on it- all equipment out of original packagingNot sure how Amazon deals with returns but that's exactly what i received.This is our second toothbrush. No issues with the first and we loved it which is why we decided to buy a second one. Only problem is the pressure sensor is always on even when there is no pressure applied.
"
"
Great toothbrush, but the Black 7000 is not pairing with the iPhone 5s  or even my wife's latest iPhone SE  using the Oral B app on bluetooth.  Beware.  Their customer support just suck.
"
"
Excellent tooth brush! Love it and yes it all the time I find I brush a lot more effective. Arrived on time and fast.
"
"
My first Oral-B toothbrush lasted just over 10 years and I really liked it, so this was a no-brainer for me. But THIS brush... good lord toothbrushes have changed. It not only syncs with the little display that you can put on the mirror to guide you through proper brushing, but it also syncs with a smartphone app that strokes my gadget addiction like crazy. There's too much to cover in a short review, just google it and read what all this thing can do. It definitely changes the way you care for your teeth.
"
"
The toothbrush has six different modes, bluetooth tracking device and blah, but it's all useless add-on features that you will never use.  Out of the six different modes, I only use one or two modes the most.  I don't use the tracking device at all because it takes time and effort to track something that I could careless about.  However, the toothbrush does the job and clean your mouth, but I would go with cheaper model in the future to save money.
"
"
I received the product on time however it was not posted in a mailing box, instead it was shipped in the Oral-B toothbrush box. The box was damaged and partial open.I opened the box and to my disappointment there was only 3 out of the 5 Oral B tooth brush heads.I placed the Oral-B toothbrush handle on the charging station for 12 hours and it wouldn't charge.
"
"
Doesn't work with my note 5 or samsung tablets.I'm still happy with it, comes with a screen to display the time so I don't need the app.Great for longterm use as the batteries are easily replaceable.  Will last me at least 10 years no doubt .
"
"
You never realize just how dirty your teeth are until you use a professional toothbrush. After purchasing this toothbrush the ""straight out of the dentist"" feel has become my norm. I can not go back to manual brushing after purchasing this.Highly, highly, highly, recommend this if you're oral health conscious.
"
"
Meets expectations. Love the selection of cleaning modes and timer.
"
"
I love it, so much easier to have a white smile with this brush... It really worth the price!
"
"
There's a white one and a black one. I thought the black one would be bigger but they're the same size.
"
"
VERY DISAPPOINTED! Got it as a Christmas gift, but the mood was ruined. Smartguide device is not working at all (some parts of symbols are on, some parts are off). Tried new sets of batteries several times, but it doesn't help. Pushing ""set"" or ""h/min"" button doesn't help either.Smartguide was the reason for buying this brush. I used to own Oral-B brushes for more than a decade, but I suppose it's time to switch to Philips.
"
"
Very disappointing, way too gimmicky and with very low battery life which is only 1 week. I bought this as an upgrade to my perfectly usable slim little Oral-B Pulsonic, that 3 years in, still has an impressive 6 week battery life. The only thing I like about this one is the standard round shape of the brush head.Don't waste your money; it's large, expensive, doesn't look near as great as you'd think and you really don't need all the timer variations it offers. I love Oral-B power toothbrushes but give this one a miss....it's like the windows8 of toothbrushes...you know the next version will be better so wait for that one.

I am replacing a older Oral B with this newer model. I bought it despite reading about extremely long charging times and several complaints about the battery it uses.It has worked fine for the last month (other then taking a FULL 24 hours to charge) untill last week. I went to use it, dead. I charged it for a full day and used it before work. I got home that night, and before i went to bed went to use it. DEAD.  I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have to charge it for 24 hours to get a single use out of it. I'm going to try and get some resolution with Oral B about this issue, i'm assuming this is not by design. Maybe they can ship me just a battery and how to replace it, because the packaging was complicated and huge and i didn't save it for 2 months before it basically became useless.  I will update this review of anything is resolved.
"
"
Messy, the charging unit and bottom of of the brush  are covered with slime after three uses. The ridiculous gimics  like the ability to connect it to a cell phone to monitor your brushing practices  and to have a smiley face monitoring brushing while you brush is like having a helicopter mother hovering over you. I returned it and bought the Dutch equivalent.
"
"
i like it a lot
"
"
I love it ill never you a non-electric tooth brush again.  Although i think the 5000 is more than adequate, but i guess the travel case is kinda nice.
"
"
Received the oral-b 7000 package which im sure that was the returned or refurbished item. Toothbrush doesn't turn on, charger does not charge the toothbrush, package without 2 additional toothbrush heads, without the vinyl traval bag. Which were supposed to be included in the package, and stated including with the original retail box. Returned the next day and got refunded. If the unit is working and I used it, I wasnt even aware the package is missing the brush heads and the bag. Very bad experience.
"
"
it is very very made, just like a piece of art, but useless, actually i am a bit disapointed, not much better than a normal $2 one.
"
"
AMAZING toothbrush if you want healthy gum and great clean teeth purchase this product its so worth the money !!!
"
"
Absolutely love this toothbrush. It was easy to set up.Monitoring pressure and time of brushing provides very helpful feedback, to foster better tooth brushing habits. I've attached the monitor to the bathroom vanity mirror (where it doubles as a clock). The app was easy to install and use.The toothbrush itself is wonderful, giving a wonderful clean. I have ordered replacement heads f every available type. So far I've tried the whitening ones and they are GREAT! I can see and feel the difference of using this toothbrush (compared to my other cheap electric toothbrush) immediately on use. My teeth feel squeaky clean in between brushes and it makes the mundane task fun and educational.I never thought I would spend >$100 on a toothbrush...but I am so glad I did. I am never going back to my old toothbrushes after this!
"

First off - those who are complaining that the clear cover doesn't match the timer needs to understand that it's not supposed to. It's merely a back cover to hold the clip that affixes the times to a wall/mirror. The smiley on the clear cover is more than likely just an indicator to put two-and-two together.The deets:- Upon first charge (and as indicated by the instructions) took a full 24 hours for the charge light to stop blinking to indicate that it was fully charged and ready to go.- Switching between modes requires the sync between either the provided timer OR the downloadable app to flip through the modes and to see what mode you've chosen.- Unfortunately, it doesn't remember your setting for your next brushing which is a downfall, but not a deal breaker.- It's not dreadfully loud or have brain shaking vibrations, it's tolerable for me from never owning an electric toothbrush. Something to get used to.- The 3 brush heads that it comes with are great and feel good on the teeth.- The provided timer quickly syncs with the toothbrush once you turn it on and start brushing and does what it's described to doRead the dang instructions folks. I saw a lot of complains about things that are explained in the instructions. I know we all like to believe ourselves amazing and in no need of any instructions for anything ever! But do yourself this favour and read them!The hard case is very sturdy and better quality than I expected. It a smooth textured case that feels like you could drop it many times and everything will still be in tact and safe.The charger for the toothbrush is SO easy to use. And the added ""safe keeper"" (for lack of a better word at the moment) to hold your additional brush heads is very handy.  I can only assume that the little leatherette pouch it comes with would be to carry your charger and whatever else you may want to carry. It's a nice little touch.Perfect toothbrush ever at it's high price point. Try to get it on sale :)
"
"
The quickest summary for this item is:I spend less time brushing my teeth than before, and my teeth feel great!Notes:- pressure sensor is great for a chewer like me.- less time brushing my teeth overall- feel cleaner than before- I really like the app but the reviews are not great- Sale price is really good compared to other places- travel kit is nice for me where work takes me over night oftenI'm looking forward to my next dental visit to hear what they say.  I typically have inflammation in my top gums but the app had a program to help with that using the massage mode on the brush.
"
"
Picture of the stand above is different than the one you get, doesn't have a slot for the clock, also the plastic cover doesn't fit in place properly, falls off easily because the tabs were set on the wrong side. Also the plastic cover for the clock I got was molded incorrectly. Pretty disappointed, for the price I imagined it would be built much better.
"
"
Brush just has 3 modes, it should have 6 six modes. The guide didn't work.
"
"
Only had this a couple of months but I like it.  My only gripe would be that compared to the sonicare I had before, this brush is LOUD.  I guess it's the difference of having a rotating brush head vs one that oscillates at a high frequency.  All the extras are a bit of a gimmick, like the app and stand. The travel case is solid but it's large and heavy and it won't function as a charging station to plug in like sonicare diamond clean did.  Still happy considering the price I paid for it. Brush heads are much cheaper and seem to last longer too.  Teeth feel as clean as with the sonicare.
"
"
Omg I received this for christmas.I love it! After im done i literally have squeeky clean teeth.Within a couple of weeks i definitley noticed my teeth are whiter also. I like the counter to show how long i've been brushing. I'm interested to see how my next dental appt will go. I have small and crooked spots which were so hard to clean with a manual brush. The first couple of times my gums bled a bit, after that it was all good. I hated the feeling of the toothbrush in my mouth but am used to it now. I actually feel i have clean teeth when im done brushinh. Yes its pricey, but worth every penny!
"
"
I purchased this electric toothbrush set on Prime Day earlier this year and I could not be happier with the purchase! For years, I have used regular toothbrushes and I can say with certainty that I will never be switching back to them after using this toothbrush.The variety of brush heads allows you to use the product in several ways, ranging from regular brushing, to tongue brushing, to whitening/polishing. It also has several built-in modes that you can easily change on the fly with the dedicated button. It also includes a timer/clock that tracks your brushing and rates your brushing sessions to motivate you to brush your teeth for the full duration (2 minutes, people!). The brush has a pressure sensor that detects if you're using too much force and flashes a red light, which I really enjoy as well. Apparently I used to brush too hard, so I'm glad that I've fixed that habit.The toothbrush charges on the included dock and the battery lasts for about 10 brushes, so it's easy to pack it into its case and take it for a weekend and not worry about battery life. Personally I always return it to the dock after use so I've never run into any issues with the battery.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this toothbrush to anybody. The build quality is extremely high and its performance exceeds my expectations. 10/10 would brush teeth again.
"
"
Compared to the Sonicare that I used prior, this is noiser but appers to clean better and appers more rugged. Hopefully will last longer than the two Sonicares which only lasted less than 2.5 years each. Of course time will tell. Takes, as advertised,  almost full 24 hours for first charge.  The only reason for the 4 stars is not enough information on care of the Ni metal hydride battery. They do mention, to prolong battery life that it should be fully discharged at least every 6 months but there is no mention if after the full disharge it should be fully charge or not prior to reuse.
"
"
1st amazon has great delivery this time, 5 days earlier. I currently has Philips sonic care. it only last for 2 years and die with no reason. call customer service but never response. the OEM replacement brush quality is really bad. My old Oral B last more than 15 years and it still works well. Now I had Oral B and this 7000 works really good and 3D White brush has bought my white teeth back. No 1 Brand and Quality.
"
"
Great Toothbrush, so good that I bought a 2nd one for my wife.The phone App makes the system very easy to setup and use.Only issue, though expected, is that both the bluetooth connectivity to the display gets confused when 2 toothbrushes are trying to connect.
"
"
What a fantastic toothbrush.  Works awesome.  Gives you 5 stars for brushing properly on the display.  Vibrates/flashes to change sections on your teeth.  Really happy that I got this toothbrush!  Feels like walking out of the dentist everyday!
"
"
Fonctionne très bien. Mon dentiste a vu une différence.Le moniteur de temps fonctionne bien et lorsque tu appliques trop de pression sur les dents, le LED rouge est efficace.Batterie ne garde pas sa charge longtemps (Moins d'une semaine).Le module de charge aurait aussi pu être de couleur assortie.Même chose pour les têtes de brossage.Black édition se doit d'être NOIR... Tu payes en quelque sorte pour cela...
"
"
absolute teeth cleaner, I used many products before but this one surely pays off the price.  by the way, I don't use all fancy stuff it comes with such as Bluetooth software and the icon stuff, but the unit itself is great.
"
"
This toothbrush has pretty much every feature you can think of and probably more! Some even being a little unnecessary and just for amusement and I guess motivation for maintaining good oral hygiene.  If you can afford the steep price then I definitely do recommend this toothbrush as it is the best I ever used but if not then there are other brushes by oral-b that accomplish the same goal for less money.
"
"
this toothbrush is perfect, and for the price, its worth it, a lot of people think youre crazy to spend this much on a tooth brush, but for an object that you use twice, sometimes three times a day, its fully worth it,
"
"
Bought as a gift for my dad worked for a few days then suddenly charger died on me, Amazon replaced it, Whole family uses Oral B power brushes never had a problem other then battery eventually dying... Anyways great purchase and thank you Amazon for replacing a christmas gift!
"
"
Only been using item for a few days but works well. I appreciate how it encourages you to brush a full 2 minutes. Took a while to charge completely first time but now is great. Good purchase.
"
"
Gotta love Prime Days. Otherwise I don't think I would have paid full price for all the bells and whistles (bluetooth and separate timer). The travel case is awesome.
"
"
Very good quality and makes fore a good teeth! I would recemend this product to all the people I know.
"
"
Looked great until it took 24+ hours to charge and for a runtime of about 15-30mins total.Im very unhappy with this as now i dont have a toothbrush because i am returning this one !
"
"
Bought it to replace a previous electric tooth brush - very impressed.  Lots of power & battery seems to last forever.
"
"
Love it. Lots of functions and my tooth feel so much cleaner after using it.
"
"
Had a few Oral-B electric toothbrushes. This one functions great!
"
"
Lights are a little bright and flash when charging is irritating at night.  Hook up to phone is simple.
"
"
Gift for the girlfriend. Works very well, but will wake up anyone close to it!
"
"
C'était un cadeau de Noël pour mon mari, et il est très satisfait de sa brosse à dents !!Super achat et reçu très rapidement !Merci xx
"
"
Bought this before I lost all my teeth. Worked great. Now I use it as a vibrator.
"
"
The separate guide Is very useful and better than having it on your phone via Bluetooth like the newer models.
"
"
3 years of use, died. My oral B is 10 years old and works fine.Philips said “nothing we can do”.Never buying from them again.
"
"
Stopped working about year after purchace. Worse electric tooth brush I have ever bought.
"
"
Bluetooth feature is a useless grummick. But the watch gadget is useful.The product feels premium.
"
"
Pour me brosser les dents voyons! J’appréce les différents types de brossages offert par le produit.
"
"
I have always use Oral B. It is a great product!
"
"
I must admit, until I got this thing I really did think my toothbrush worked well.  It really is a dental cleaning type feeling every time you brush!
"
"
It is incredible the difference between using this and a traditional toothbrush, fantastic product and my teeth are genuinely whiter from using this. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
"
"
Have been using a cheeper Oral B for several years. What a difference in the brush movement and vibration that improves cleaning. Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
Gift that doesn't let recipient get away with anything (brushing timer), LOL !
"
"
I love this toothbrush, ordered it on prime day and was worth it with all the extras that came with it
"
"
Love it. Never not going to use an electric toothbrush.
"
"
I love this. My boyfriend gave this to me last Christmas and I will never switch to different brand ever again. I really love the quality and style! I will surely recommend this to my friends. Good product indeed!
"
"
It really works, I wish I got an electric too brush years ago.
"
"
Genuine Oral-B and good quality toothbrush.
"
"
Cannot believe the difference it make!!!
"
"
Had it for a week so far and works great,noticing a difference already.
"

Delivered promptly and works great.

Amazing toothbrush, can see the difference in just 3 days after using it

I'm very happy with this product as it does everything it is supposed to, however, I ordered a white unit and received black.
"
"
not bad  it's hard to find which mode I'm using.
"
"
It works beautifully.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned.
"
"
Fantastic electric toothbrush!
"
"
Sort of sad to see Oral B resorting to such marketing ploys as ""Oral B Precision Black 7000"" - this, and their hyped commercials to go along with it. Why not improve their technology?If you want a superior toothbrush, and for a similar price, invest in a Philips Sonicare! I owned both, and would never abandon my Sonicare for a clearly inferior Oral B anything --black or otherwise!!!
"
"
Vraiment fantastique!!!Très performante.
"

Love it!

Product is incredibly good!!

Already had one for our House in Langley and loved it so much decided to buy one for our Apartment in Vancouver. The whole family loves it

This toothbrush works. And while the toothbrush isn't a 2 star item, the entire package definitely is. I've wanted this toothbrush for years. Always lusted after it. Finally I decided to treat myself to this. Wow. So disappointed. Let me explain it all to you.The Bad:THE CHARGER: For any toothbrush over $100 I would expect a nice charger. Something substantial. And, look at the photos of the charging base with this brush - that looks great! But it's not. Not at all. First, have you seen those Oral-B electric toothbrushes you can buy for $15 that have the charging dock? I mean for $15 you get the charging dock and the electric brush. I ordered one of those cheap ones for my child. The charger included in the $15 set is model 3757. The model included with this set? 3757. You see that nice picture of the big sturdy dock in this set? No. It's not like that. It's a little $1 charger base, that you then click on 2 more pieces of $0.25 plastic onto it to make it look big an sturdy. It's a rip off.  Som, that means then the brush must be worth the $150 itself right?THE BRUSH: Have you gone to the grocery store, and bought one of those $7 electric children's brushes that run on AA battery? If you have used one of those, then you know what to expect here. See, I come from a competing brand of electric toothbrush that was different. This Oral-B is the exact same style, and type of brush head, and head movement as the $7 one my child graduated from. I couldn't believe it. That doesn't mean this doesn't work well, it does. But - where does all the $ go to? Ok, it's because it's Bluetooth and has the little happy face guy right? Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. If it was, I would at least, at the very least expect some basic memory features on the brush. What do I mean? I have sensitive teeth. The brush has 5 settings, with one of them being sensitive. So, I turn on the brush - it starts at full power and the timer starts running. with toothpaste flying all over - i need to hit the button on the brush a few times to switch it to sensitive. then i can put in my mouth. I'll clean up the mess later.  But - next time I use the brush, as least it will remember I turned it off on sensitive and start there right? Nope. Every single time - you need to go and tell the brush - only after it is started - what setting you want to use. It's ridiculous. You CAN use the phone app to change settings, even move some settings from the brush. You shouldn't need to download a phone app - to make these basic changes.THE OK:THE BRUSH HEADS: They are brush heads. They seem to work, again, the same as the $7 ones you get from the grocery store. There's no pulsing, vibration like you feeling with other brands. This feels cheap.THE 'CASE': so you put the cheap, plastic $2 base station together - and it lets you hold 5 brush heads. 3 of which are supplied. THat's ok. It's still cheap garbage though.THE GOOD:PRESSURE DETECTION: I grew up brushing too hard. I don't anymore - but I did test that on this brush and it emits a nice bright red light from the back of the brush to warn you if you apply too much pressure.THE HAPPY GUY: So this guy counts to 30, 4 times. Shows you what quadrant of your mouth to brush. It works fine. Shows you what setting your brush is on. Easy to set time on it. Made me realize I used to only brush about 1 minute total for the last 45 years. Now 2 minutes seems normal.CONCLUSION: There is no way this is worth anywhere what it sells for. I would say this is worth $80 at the most. Then maybe other companies would also start pushing cool tech brushes and real, well made base stations and chargers to create some competition. You can get the same performance for $15 from Oral-B on Amazon - just without the fancy tech. Even the $15 comes with extra brush heads.

My old Oral-B toothbrush , after many years of usage could barely make it through a brushing on one charge.  I bought this one which the battery lasts twice as long as the old one ever did (5 days vs10).  Love all of the upgrades with Bluetooth and all the hints on the app on how to get better cleaning.  I can feel the difference since the first brushing. I am extremely impressed!*** A couple months in now and I’m even more impressed.  I can see the difference now.  Stains that have been there for a long time are disappearing and my teeth always feel like I’ve just got a cleaning at the dentist.  Btw I will be getting a cleaning in a couple weeks and will see what the hygienist says.

This is a really good electric toothbrush but I believe is a bit overpriced if you buy it at normal price. I bought it on prime days with a really good discount so I'm happy with that.As a toothbrush, the various modes helping a lot. I didn't found the app very helpful, is more on the gadget side but if somebody keep tracking maybe it's worth something.One thing I don't like is the blue light when it's charging. It is staying on ad flashing all the time and this is annoying especially at night (my wife have the 8000 which have a smooth white light that's staying on only for a few seconds). I'm taking one star off for this.Overall I would recommend this toothbrush but with the right price.

This unit is incredible, no question about it!  I have been using the 5000 series for a few years now however dropped it a few times and the brush heads were no longer working properly.  I decided to upgrade to the 7000 and super happy I did.  The quality surprisingly is much better than the 5000.  The motor clearly is stronger or more refined if you wish.....just feels and sounds better.  How do I know this you ask because I had only an older unit to compare to?  Well I also purchased to brand new Bluetooth 5000 series brushes for my kids therefore was able to compare both units side by side.  One thing I noticed right away between the two units was with the different settings. As I cycled through the different settings, I noticed that the settings on the 7000 were much more profound or noticeable over the 5000 however for my kids who were using a manual brush, the 5000 is 100 times more beneficial when it comes to dental care over any manual brush.  These units after every brush feels like you just left the dental hygienist for a cleaning....they really are worth the money.  I do have to say one thing though....although the app is very cool and super robust, I found myself using the unit the 7000 comes with and grew tired of using the app and I'm a real gadget guy so take it from there.  The problem with the 5000 is that it no longer comes with the side unit that counts down or tells you which cleaning mode your on so the app might be more intriguing for purchasing the 5000.  I believe you can still buy the older 5000 unit with the side unit but I'm not sure if that one unlike the new Bluetooth 5000 and 7000 series, have the red light (brushing to hard indicator) right on the hand in place of it being displayed in the counter unit where you have to stare while brushing to insure you not brushing to hard.  And last, I gave this 4 stars only because the side unit that comes with the 7000 is poorly designed in that it sits flat on the counter meaning you'd have to be on your knees brushing to see it.......not sure why they would'nt have built it such that it could be tilted upwards so you can see it while brushing but ok!  It does come with a suction cup and housing to fasten to a mirror but really????? Like you're going to stick that puppy on the mirror in front to you every time you brush? Or leave it off to the side just to have to remove it every time you clean your mirror?  Not.  Other than that, this brush is the bomb and if you can afford the extra $$ to make the jump from the 5000 to the 7000 then do yourself a favour and do it.....ya won't regret it.

This being my first electric toothbrush I can't compare it to anything. It does clean the teeth. I wish it did just that without the glaring and blinking neon blue light that would be sufficient to beam an airliner down. Make no mistake, if you have a window in the bathroom, passerbys will know when you brush your teeth. I also find the handle very uncomfortable, almost like it wasn't developed to be a hand-operated device. Try hanging on to a tapered spindle. I also wish one could turn off the 2 or 3 minute timed stutter. Just want to clean my teeth without feeling I am still hanging out in traffic and someone is honking at me from behind. Ok, this toothbrush is for techno lovers that don't like to switch the static off. It's doing the job but is not something I would buy again.

This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush.  I was so satisfied with my first one, that I didn't even research any other brands.  The only reason I purchased a new electric toothbrush is because the old one would only hold a charge for a couple of uses, and would need to be charged again.It's a treat to only have to charge this one after 5-7 days of use!I like the styling of this toothbrush, and it comes with some premium accessories.  The travel case looks good and is very high quality.  I haven't used the bluetooth display very much, but shows the time and which part of your mouth you should be cleaning (there are four bars in a circle pattern, for left/right and top/bottom).  The charger is very basic and works well.  Plugging it in to charge before bed will result in a full charge in the morning.The one drawback with these toothbrushes is the expensive replacement heads.  There are cheaper knock offs out there, if the Oral B brand ones are cost prohibitive.After using electric toothbrushes for years, I would never go back to manual brushing.  2-3 minutes with this toothbrush and you feel like you have just had a professional cleaning!There are less expensive Oral B electric toothbrushes that can be purchased, if you want to try one out before buying in to the higher price range, but if you are looking for a premium model then I would recommend this one for sure.

Absolutely the best tooth brush I have ever had! I have been using Braun electric toothbrushes for over 17 years, and this one is by far tops them all. Recently, I had been using very simple Braun toothbrush for $30, and I noticed how build up near the gums is not being cleaned no matter how long I brush. I started to get some dark and calcium like building at the bottom of my teeth as well. I knew the time had come to buy a new one. I cannot tell you how happy and impressed I am with this one! All the build up is gone, and my teeth are visible whiter! I really like the smiley face and star system. It helps me to know how long I have cleaned my teeth for. The timer also serves me as a clock, which can be indispensable in the mornings. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, because I can literally see and feel the results. Highly recommend. Also, what partially 'sold' me on this toothbrush is that it is made in Germany. A rarity these days when pretty much everything is made in China. Excellent product, superb quality

First get your teeth professionally cleaned and then use the toothbrush regularly; on your next visit you will see a big difference. That is what happened to me. The best toothbrush I have used to date. It is a bit expansive for a toothbrush, but I believe it is worth it.
"
"
I am a big fan of this brush. It makes me feel like I am getting a great, dentist worthy clean.(TECH) PROS:The tech side of it is simple yet effective, and even kind of scolds you if you don't floss for 4 days, which I love! It records when you brush, how long you brush for, if you applied too much pressure, if you flossed, brushed tongue, used mouth wash. It even gives you achievements for things (brushing 7 days in a row, brushing in the afternoon, etc.), which is hilarious but totally plays with my gamer side. Being able to set it up if you want whitening, or to help with bad breath, or whatever, is really neat. It will help you out by suggesting what brush head you should use, what toothpaste you should use, mouthwash... for the best results, albeit you don't need to use what they suggest. Also: you can get your dentist to put in what your problem spots are for extra attention, which is too cool! It will tell you when to change your brush head, and ask you about dental appointments.(TECH) CONS: While I haven't had problems with the range for my bluetooth, I have had problems with it not connecting with the app. Usually restarting the app will fix that.(HARDWARE) PROS: The travel case is sleek and easy to use, and can hold 2 brush heads. The brush itself is sleek, easy to hold, and the stand it comes with is simple and holds your extra brushes. The brush with vibrate when you should change where you are brushing, and flash red if you are applying too much pressure. It is pretty loud, but that doesn't bother me. The clock it comes with is cute, but with my phone app on beside me, it's not really used. This brush feels like it is cleaning everything, and my teeth feel fantastic afterwards!(HARDWARE) CONS: Replacement/extra heads are expensive! The brush itself is way expensive! I did, however, get it on sale for half off, and I felt it was worth that price for sure. I haven't used the toothbrush away from it's stand for more than 4 days, so I am not sure about the battery life, though other reviews say it only lasts a week outside of charge.I'd definitely recommend it, but mostly if it is on sale.
"
"
I was very disappointed with the Black 7000.  The toothbrushing mechanism and the anti plaque brush seem to be identical to the Triumph version which I have been using for many years.  The 1 second pause between brushing segments is simply irritating and the remote monitor is a gimmick which is certainly not worth the additional cost.  Despite the 14 day between charge claim I find that after a full charge, 4minutes use a day lasts only a week.  I certainly expected some new technology from Oral-B after so many years.
"
"
The battery doesn't hold a charge for longer than a week and takes nearly a full day and a half to charge. I'm not sure if this is normal or my unit is defective but it is annoying. I have an Oral B electric toothbrush thats a few years older that charges full in an hour and holds the charge for 2 weeks. Really disappointed that their premium product would perform so poorly. The blue LED's are also very (very) bright, and blink while charging.Looks wise it is very nice looking. I really like the new design and the colour (much better than the boring looking light gray on the older model). Also it comes with a couple heads so i didn't have to buy a refill for a few months. Well packaged.For potential travellers: the power plug is only rated for North American voltage so don't try using it overseas (even with an adapter) you can damage the battery. I had to leave this brand new one at home and bring my old Oral B to Europe because that would accept international voltage.Overall very disappointed and will be looking at getting a different brand when this one dies (which at this rate i'm sad to say probably won't be long). I've been a long time Oral B customer and advocate since my first electric toothbrush but am extremely disappointed at the drop in quality.
"
"
Pros: cleans teeth very efficiently.Has a variety of cleaning modes.Good battery life.Case feels good to the touch, so much so that you want to touch it every so often!Cons: Hand grip is very un-ergonomic; awkward in hand as if you're holding a long brick.Battery charge from dead takes a stupendously long time like 30 hrs; unacceptable. My camera's battery charger takes an hour!It does two little bumps every 30 secs, it's so annoying.You have no idea which mode it is unless you look at the lcd screen which would be redundant had it had the f***ing modes on its handle.No memory as to what setting was last used.In short, the guy who designed this had no idea what he was doing.  For the money you would think a little thought went into it, but no.
"
"
I thought for a long time before purchasing this:  Should I spend $200 on a toothbrush???The answer? DEFINITELY.  I have used so many cheaper models (Oral B, Philips etc) and this one does one heck of a job.  During my last dental visit they barely had to do any scaling.  It makes the whole dentist experience so much more enjoyable.The carrying case is a little bit bulky and has a foam inside which is sort of silly for a wet toothbrush.  It would be nice if there was ventilation so the toothbrush could dry.  It would also be nice if there was another way to charge it, like the Philips Diamond Clean carrying case.  10 day charge isn't long enough to take on a vacation so either I have to pack 2 toothbrushes, use a less great toothbrush for 2 weeks, or carry the awkward charger and bulky carrying case.
"
"
My dentist was extremely pleased when I told him that I had finally bought the Oral-B electric toothbrush, this one is perfect for me, I used it on deployments to Africa, and the charge lasts over a month, the Bluetooth is also fantastic, I can brush in my tent while the receiver is about 40 feet away, great buy
"

I have been using the same Oral B Triump electric toothbrush 9000 for ten years and decided to treat myself to this new one. It is amazing. I see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth and tartar removal already after only two weeks. Can hardly wait to go for my next cleaning and see if the hygienist sees a difference too.
"
"
During my last trip to the dentist the hygienist suggested I get an electric toothbrush. I drink a lot of coffee so presumably this would help with the staining, and also making sure the gums were okay near the teeth.So I went with this model and have being using it for about three weeks. It is one of the more expensive models, and it could be that you could get a less expensive one that is just as good, but I do not know. It was easy to set up. The instructions are mostly easy to follow and there is nothing very complex. There is an app that can be downloaded to your phone, if you want to go that way. There is a charging stand, and a container for the toothbrush if you want to take it on the road.If comes with three different brush heads. The head should be replaced after about three months of use. They are not cheap, so electric toothbrushes do create a self-perpetuating market for supples.I took it on a five-day trip and did not need to recharge it during that period, which was good.Overall, this appears to be a good quality product. I am satisfied with it so far, and would recommend it to others.
"

This is an amazing toothbrush. Before getting this electric toothbrush, I was having cavity issues (due to no flossing, lack of calcium and a lack of routine brushing). Oddly after acquiring this toothbrush, I started brushing more often, each brush was cleaner than when I used the manual brush, took shorter amount of time and used less toothpaste. I use the travel case that came with the toothbrush, and the timer is great too. I don't use the bluetooth apps as I do not feel I need my phone to brush my teeth. Overall I highly recommend this toothbrush because it is more effective than manual brushing for me. Its ease of use has somehow increased the frequency of my brushing as well. Even with no flossing, I have not had a cavity since acquiring this toothbrush.
"
"
I have been a fan of oral B for year, but not of this toothbrush, it last me 7 months after that it didn't charge at all, I got a second one and same thing, l cant believe how expensive it is and no quality whatsoever.
"
"
I bought this thing during the Mother's day sale, so the price was excellent, however, I have to say that the so-called features are a gimmick. I ""upgraded"" from a few year old Professional Care 8850.I must first admit that the toothbrush comes with quite a few accessories, including a travel case, which is very nice. Smart guide works very well, tells you which mode you're on, but seems to be judging me. If I don't make it for the full two minutes, I get a sad face, which ruins my day. Make sure you complete the cycle and you'll feel very good about yourself and the brush won't shame you.Has many more cleaning modes than my older model, but doesn't seem to clean significantly better or have a much better motor than the old one. I do like the red LED warning if you're pressing too hard.I laughed to myself when I saw that this toothbrush connects to your cell phone via bluetooth and has an app, but figured I might as well try it.  This feature does not work at all. Connects to my phone and immediately disconnects and then tells me I should brush longer next time. If you're going to advertise this as a feature, even if it's silly, it should work.Overall, it's a good toothbrush with many accessories, but it falls short of feeling like an upgrade from my previous model.
"
"
It's so good at cleaning teeth that I've decided to become an on call dentist going around the neighbourhood cleaning people's teeth for a small fee with this brush!It has different modes for different folks, battery lasts an insanely long time on a single charge and the bluetooth connectivity is more than just a gimmick. It actually promotes proper cleaning etiquette and helps you build a schedule to help you maximise your benefit from all the various brush heads they have to offer.Buy it, use it and impress your dentist with how clean and healthy your teeth and gums are!
"
"
I always thought these were a gimmick but my teeth feel so much cleaner.  I probably could have bought the less expensive one but I always options I don't use.  Beware of the heads you buy, I purchased compatible heads and they fell apart when brushing and they are choking hazards.
"
"
I have owned (including this one) 4 electric toothbrush by Oral B since year 2000 and a Philips that broke within 3 months.  Oral B quality and durability are superior. Not much to say about this model but any of this company’s toothbrush line I can get behind.
"
"
I got this product to replace an older (much older) version of Oral-B electric toothbrush that I had for years. Since I had the same for so long, I decided to go with the most recent model (at the time I bought it). I like all the features of this toothbrush - adjustable speed settings, compatibility with different brushes, sensor indicating if you are pressing too hard with the brush, convenient and easy-to-clean holder, casing for travel, etc. The battery life is just great! I've gone over a month without recharging it and regular use. I definitely recommend this product. (especially when on sale! great deal)
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dent, quoi qu'un peu cher pour un tel objet. La connection bluetooth fait un peu gadget mais on s'en sert quand même, tout comme les différents mode de brossage. Un point négatif tout de même: la batterie. Car pour s'assurer une bonne durée de vie, il est préférable d'effectuer des cycles complets de chargement, même si le manuel indique qu'il n'y a besoin de le faire qu'à l'occasion. A part cela, la batterie dure comme annoncée, soit une semaine environ. Bonne qualité de manière générale. Un plus aussi pour la boite de voyage, très utile.
"
"
I am very happy with this electric tooth brush.  I ordered it in Black because I had  one before in white {different model}and I noticed after time the white didn't stay  so white.  I thought the price on this was perfect.  I priced it in the store,  it was about $100. more than what I paid on Amazon.  This  comes in black and white.  I got the black.  As for the settings and the performance, I have no complaint.  Some reviews felt it was slow to charge.  I keep it on the charger 24/7 - I do not have any issues with slow charging.  I remove it only during use, everything is great.  Thank you.
"
"
This is a nice unit which leaves my teeth feeling clean. There is small effort from my side required and the spinning head does the most work.Have not run out of power yet since the base is a charger and with multiple heads its perfect for our family.Only issue is the base gets gunk build up even when cleaning the brush itself so you have to clean that. And maybe the base could be smaller.
"
"
Great job cleaning teeth:In 14 days of using twice daily my teeth are as clean as they have ever been. My only complain is a bit of gum sensitivity using the cross action head. I am confident this will go away shortly.Oral B customer service is top notch:My toothbrush arrived with a broken remote display unit. I called the manufacturer and had a new one at my door in 3 days.Some issues:The remote unit has a cheap screen and the app should allow you to add flossing sessions manually.
"
"
After 30 days of trailing this model and coming from an older high end Oral B toothbrush, what a difference. It is great to be made aware that you are brushing too hard as you would never think you were. Also gums feels so refreshed and teeth look and feel super clean. Absolutely love the application. The Bluetooth connectivity at first seams senseless, but after actually utilizing it, I find it a great tool for keeping up my oralHygiene.  Highly recommended!!!
"
"
Amazing! I switched from manual to electric and I was a bit worried because I tend to have sensitive teeth but this brush has been great. The different modes are really conviennent and I saw whiter teeth after one day of use. Really gives my mouth the « dentist clean » feeling. Will definitely buy one for my wife.
"
"
Works very well. It's relatively quiet, and communicates via Bluetooth without any problems. The downside is the length of time it takes to recharge: ~23 hours. Because of its slow charging time, plan to use a manual brush at least once every time.
"
"
Very pleased with the Oral-B Pro 7000, as this was a replacement for a 8 year old model, what a difference in technology in those years.  The digital clock interfaces with the device and give one a status of brushing, The only negative is the travel box is very heavy, but also very robust, but it is a bit overboard and could have been made much lighter.  When flying every OZ counts these days.
"
"
Prosfeels high quality3 brush heads includedmany modes and extra featuresGerman madeOral B brand something i can trustConsmany features but excessivetoo many extra parts, I perfer just a brush and charger that is it. no case.expensiveMy version did not come with bluetooth  but all other features are the same so i had to request for refund.  Very good electric toothbrush with premium feel and high price. I say it is worth it considering how expensive dentist charge . This is a small price to pay for good teeth.
"
"
The brush is good but battery is horrible, had it less than a year and now it won't charge at all and it's not replaceable. I think warranty is two years so will be contacting support but it is poor design to not be able to replace the battery. This device will not last you more than 2 years.
"
"
Have been using the oral B 5000 for some years now. This is pretty much the same with some new improvements. Firstly the lovely black handle with blue lights is a really nice touch and the premium feel of the travel case is a welcome update. There is also a tongue cleaning mode (where the pressure sensors are off) but I must say I don't use the modes other than clean and deep clean (3 mins instead of 2).The only thing oral B should really do for the next model is to please upgrade the battery to a lithium one as NiMH is such old technology with issues such as battery memory and the need for complete discharging, etc.Overall a great performing toothbrush with some aesthetic upgrades compared to the lower model 5000.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush, I didn't care for the all the Bluetooth stuff so I got rid of most of that stuff, nobody needs to ""track"" their brushing on their phone. As for the brush itself, my teeth have never been cleaner. At first my gums didn't like the power of this brush but delicate power setting let my gums acclimate to the increased brushing force coming from a good 'ol manual toothbrush.
"
"
I received a old box, there is a coupon expiring jul 2017, so I’m pretty concerned how long the battery will be good for.Honestly, you don’t need 6 modes, travel case, Bluetooth, a clock... if I was to redo my purchase, I would pick the basic one
"
"
Great toothbrush. I've used the sonicare black for the last 2 years and this one is way better! It's like I've left the dentist every time I brush my teeth. My teeth feel clean all day! I thought the timer was a little cheesy, but it's actually great!
"
"
This toothbrush works great, has alot of power. I don't like where the modes button is because I often hit it while brushing. I also can't really tell the diference between the diference modes all that much. I do love the soft travel case. The timer seems a little sily and it needs bateries so I'm never going to use it. I don't know why it couldn't have been somehow a part of the base and there for powered by it.  Anyway I got it on sale and I think it was a good buy. Never going back to a manual bruch that's for sure.
"
"
I was hesitant before making this purchase as i really liked brushing manually. But i bought this on Prime day at a discount and till this date I haven’t had any problems with this product. It has 6 different variations and speed. I didn’t use its time clock and we don’t even need that as the brush is programmed such way that it will take 2 minutes to finish all its modes. I would recommend this to everyone!!!
"
"
Seems to be to hard on my teeth even at a low speed.Bluetooth just seems to be a gimic unless you can't time 2min for brushing its not worth the hassle, stick to the basic models with a waterpic and your set for oral care.
"
"
Really like the toothbrush, the battery could for sure last longer, lasts about 5 to 6 days.I brush once a day for about 4 min.Also the ⏲️ i don't think its very water proof the numbers are already looking weird.
"
"
Love this thing. It has completely changed my dental hygiene. Interactive display with feedback on brushing. Motivates me to be more attentive and better enjoy the process of brushing my teeth.
"
"
The only concern I have is with the battery being NiMH. For those unaware it's an older type of rechargeable battery where a memory effect occurs. What this means is that if you don't let if fully charge and discharge, the overall capacity of the battery will lessen with use over time. For someone who's willing to pay the extra for dental health, I wouldn't have minded the extra cost for a lithium battery where the memory effect isn't as much of a concern.
"
"
Been using it for almost an year now and it's really been a great tool and I love the travel case that comes with it so I can carry it on vacation easily. Great overall buy. Clean my teeth and has slowed down my gum recession. Would recommend to all my friends.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned. I came from a ""manual"" though. I don't care so much for the crazy modes, not sure if anyone uses them, and the bluetooth function looks like a neat thing if you're really into your dental health. I am a brute and just use it for its sheer power. Gets into all those nooks and crannies. Would recommend.
"
"
The brand was recommended by my dentist. Love using the toothbrush, and the timer is a bonus. Also love the travel case. I wish there was some sort of a usb charge mode where this brush can be universally changed - even overseas on an extended vacation - hence the 4 stats. Other than that, I'd recommend this to family and friends, especially when it's deeply discounted.
"
"
First time ever owning a electric toothbrush and it was worth the purchase on prime day!It vibrates when it is time to move to another area of your teeth to brush! I would highly recommend buying this if you want white teeth!
"
"
Battery dies fast and you can feel it fading away after not charging it for a single day. Unlike lithium batteries, the strength fades according to the charge.Really nothing special compared to other, far cheaper products.
"
"
As of right now I am dealing with a faulty battery which will not retain a charge long enough to brush for 1 full cycle, after only 2 days of owning it. I'm going to give it another day or two to try and sort this out and then will be sending this back for a replacement. The product was excellent when it did work, and the features are great. Hopefully I can get over this charging hurdle without having to send it back.
"
"
Love this toothbrush!  Have been using it for awhile now and my oral health has really improved.  My dental cleanings take no time at all, my gums are really healthy (used to bleed a lot during cleanings).  There is also very little plaque build up.  Worth the money
"
"
I love the brush and see a big difference already. I have been using it for a couple months now.The charge only lasts for 1 week, and I brush twice a day.Not sure if this is normal, but my daughter has the same toothbrush and her charge seems to hold for almost a month, brushing twice a day.
"
"
It is a toothbrush... It is convenient to know how long to clean my teeth for but the little clock it comes with is a bit of a gadget lover's gimmick and unless you really feel you need the extra cues for teeth cleaning, not worth while. As far as teeth cleaning is concerned we shall see what my dental hygienist says in a few months. Which? UK (this is the unbiased version of Consumer Reports which is available in Canada and the USA) says that the Black 7000 only does an OK job compared to some much less expensive brushes. How many words can I realistically write about a d@<n toothbrush?
"
"
I was worried at first. Paying so much money and it had a damaged box. Overall it’s great but their is a lot of useless extras that comes with the brush. Many of them useless to me.But the brush is great. Shipping time was also reasonable delay.

Love the Oral B product. Got this item on sale and the display on my iphone just enhances the experience. My teeth feel extremely clean with this tooth brush. The added enhancement of pressure sensor is an added bonus since I have receding gums from brushing too hard with a manual brush
"
"
First few days of use and it is great. Replacement for one that just burnt out after 10years so hope this lasts the same.
"
"
These toothbrush works well.  Don’t  know that I really need to bells and whistles, but I do use the sensitive option to brush my teeth wth the sensitive brush.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush, but it isn't worth the premium you pay when compared to their ""lower end"" brushes. It likely has the same motor as the cheaper Oral B brushes. You still get a Nickel Metal battery instead of a Lithium.What are you paying extra for?... the style.Thankfully, I bought it when it was heavily discounted during boxing week.
"
"
Me and my fiancé both purchased one finally after many years of my dentist telling me to get an electric toothbrush. I feel it works much better than a manual toothbrush as if I just left the dental office after every use. Battery life is good, no complaints
"
"
Nous avons essayé un autre marque de brosse à dents ont la retournée et commandé celle ci et ont l’adore !
"
"
I was lucky enough to get this brush on sale. While I don't see a huge difference from any other electric toothbrush I've used, what I do appreciate is the small base it comes with for recharging. Other brushes have bases that take up a fair amount of counter space. This brush is the perfect size.
"
"
Had an old Oral B that stopped holding a charge. This one was on sale so I bought as a replacement. Do not need the gimmicky wireless timer that comes with it. Travel case is big and heavy. Those are my only 2 negative complaints.I have a Sonicare that I leave at the cottage. Both seem to work fine and I would not recommend one over the other.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush... honestly I was driven to this model because I travel and it has a really nice case with a very portable charger pod.It does work very well.  The clock is handy in bathroom too,  I never would have thought about that :)
"
"
Had a few electric toothbrushes this one is great to hold and build quality is good.....there was 1 time in the first week the red light kept flashing so I banged it on my hand fixed it...not hard!...it's an issue with oral b's.
"
"
Absolutely love this toothbrush! Thank Amazon for lightning deals! After only 2 days people started commenting that they thought my teeth looked whiter. Great buy!
"
"
Super excited to have it in my bathroom. Glad to use it and it's a real pleasure to brush my teeth and watch the small clock with the smiley.I really love the design, the quality ( i can select many options like for sensitive teeths or for whitening teeths...).Good n fast delivery !!! Excellent service !!! In a word, i was a happy costumer.
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush got this for an extreme savings during the Black Friday deals. Teeth feel even cleaner than with our old 3000 Oral B which we have had for at least ten years and just recently have noticed it doesn't hold the charge for more than 2-3 days but still works. Like the fact it lets you know on the brush with a red light that you are applying to much pressure.
"
"
I had my last Oral B electric toothbrush for 10 years so I was due for a new one this toothbrush is excellent and well worth the money I didn't think there would be much of a difference in the cleaning of my teeth from my old toothbrush but there was a huge difference I brush my teeth on the regular setting for two minutes and then a minute on the diamond setting and it truly has taken off the service stains making my teeth nice and white and feel extra clean! Excellent product!!
"
"
Works pretty good, lots of features. Bluetooth is a novelty but is good for adjusting the handles settings (the order of the different modes). App is only meant to keep track of one person so it's not suited for sharing the handle with a partner. Bluetooth connection drops constantly with Android but works well on iOS. So other than the Bluetooth and App issues is will clean your teeth like a champ!
"
"
Amazing product. Powerful and holds a charge well. Love how it signals the user every 30 seconds to move onto the next of the 4 recommended sections of your mouth. Bluetooth and app is cool but not very useful in my experience.
"
"
Love it!Easy to use, motivating and keeps you on track.Only thing I would like is that the app would permit to track more than one person's brushing (ie a child's)...
"
"
Too loud. Comparing to the old versionExcept of that- all is good
"
"
I decided to try the Oral B Precision Black 7000 after having had the Oral B Sonic complete for about 10 years and it still works.I have to say the 7000 makes you want to brush your teeth! It leaves a clean just from the dentist feeling on your teeth.The only con, with all electric toothbrushes is the base gets dirty and needs to be wiped daily.
"
"
The bluetooth features are a little overkill for me but the toothbrush is solid.
"
"
Le chrono bleu tout est déjà brisé mais pas vraiment utile.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush.So many functions, and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter and feel cleaner than they have ever before.Love the timer, and the carrying case is perfect for trips.Would highly recommend if you're on the fence about this product.
"
"
Excellente brosse a dent je l’adore tout simplement et tellement merci pour la rapidite de la livraison car j’avais si hate de l’avoir lol quel service merci c’est excellent
"
"
Excellente brosse à dent ! Jamais déçu avec oral B. Je ne met pas la cinquième étoile car trop difficile de se servir de l'app oral b connectée en tout temps. Mais un très bon produit que je recommande :)
"
"
\Has some interesting feature to insure good gum protection
"
"
La lumière qui s'allume quand on pèse trop fort, tres bien
"
"
The toothbrush is great, I love the speed and intensity of it (something I wasn't able to find with the other toothbrushes I got in-store). The issue I have which makes me not want to give a five-star review is that as soon as I opened the carrying case both the metal ends fell off. I'm either going to have to glue gun the ends back on or not use it at all. Super disappointing.Shipping was quick though.
"
"
This toothbrush works great.  It tells you exactly what you need to know.  I have always used Oral B and this is by far a fantastic hygiene tool!
"
"
Best purchase. Our teeth were actually noticeably whiter in just a couple weeks. It was insane. The movement was shocking at first on our teeth but after a few uses it feels normal. Love it.
"
"
The toothbrush works really well and meets all my expectations. My teeth have already started to whiten up and stains are disappearing. I had a bad case of teeth stains so I decided to spend big to clean them up. Definitely not disappointed. Some small things was that on the oral b website, it said it came with 2 floss action heads, but it only came with 1.
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I've ever owned! Awesome cleaning action that leaves your teeth super clean. Once you try this toothbrush, you'll throw out your old one with no regret. This is a MUST buy.
"
"
Works perfectly. Let's face it, it's not hard to brush your teeth. This just lets you do it more accurately with improved technique. You could get away with a cheaper model, but the smartguide is awesome and the app works amazingly well.
"
"
This toothbrush was delivered very quickly, which was important to me because my last one died. The charge lasts well over a week & it comes with a couple of different brush heads. I have have it for three weeks now & feel like I have been to the dentist recently.
"
"
I really love this electric toothbrush. It really makes my teeth/mouth feel more clean. It also helped me with my teeth sensitivity because I don't over brush anymore.
"
"
Amazing electronic toothbrush.I'm a smoker and drink coffee all day and honestly I only brush my teeth once a day and my teeth are white again in just 2weeks of use. It feels like you went to your dentist for a cleaning every time you brush. Definitely worth every penny😀!!!
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It was my first electric toothbrush and I will never go back. Cleans thoroughly and efficiently. I like the visual timer.
"
"
I have been a long time user of Braun electric toothbrushes and like its predecessors, this one lives up to its billing. My teeth feel as if they've had a daily cleaning by a dental hygienist and there is nothing better than that. Can you tell I love this toothbrush?
"
"
Already broke! Started losing power after a few months - I wish I had returned (the replacement-after my original one died within weeks).
"
"
Could not ask for a better toothbrush. This thing has exceeded all expectations.
"
"
Good Item, but why have Blue Tooth on a toothbrush
"
"
Le Bluetooth ne fonctionne pas avec mon cell sur android 7.0. Oral-B recommande 7.2, moi je recommande un modèle sans le Bluetooth, moins cher. Sinon, très satisfait de son fonctionnement.
"
"
Great toothbrush. Lot of power
"
"
I have owned Oral B toothbrushes for many years! This is my latest upgrade & I absolutely love it! Cool touch with the Bluetooth etc.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush, does its job perfectly.Numerous programs, easy to use, and cleans all teeth a very nice way.
"
"
Works great. Don't really use the bluetooth part since I don't pull my phone out just to brush my teeth. Cleans my teeth and they feel great.
"
"
I love my Oral-B as it leaves my teeth feeling ""dentist clean"".  The only problem with it is the little time indicator doesn't work.
"
"
I may be exchanging it. Love the timer and all the settings but the head vibrates a little to hard.
"
"
the product itself is ok, but when it is delivered to me, it's not in a seal box, it's opened, but not used. Looks like someone returned it and it was delivered to me within 24 hours, i was surprised. I kept it as it is not used
"
"
Excellednt product.  Would recommend and buy again.
"
"
GOOD TOOTHBRUSH, but I find that you cant brush that hard and get the good stuff, $5 dollar tooth brush is better. But overall good.BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY, THIS IS MY OPINION.
"
"
Have had many different electric toothbrushes over the years.  This one is the best.  Teeth feel very clean and brushing.  Also very sensitive on the teeth and gums.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love this product, my dentist noticed I had changed things - said I was doing a great job at brushing!
"
"
Happy with it, but I think I will go with the sonic for my next brush
"
"
The brush has lots of power when it work.Most of the time the power shuts off on it's own and I have to turn it on a few times at time to complete my brushing.
"
"
The battery does not last as long as they claim. You have to charge it after 3-4 days of use. The travel case can scratch easily.
"
"
works very well, does as advertise, and while the phone app could use some improvements the fact that it will sync up after a few days is helpful if you like to monitor your brushing activity
"
"
5 stars
"
"
Teeth have never felt cleaner. I like the clock that comes with it. It gives you a simple goal to follow when brushing your teeth so you don't rush it. Also the pressure sensor made me realize I've been brushing my teeth way too hard.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. Love the blue light and all the modes. It feels solid and the travel case is really nice as well
"
"
Great product with a high price.  I always say ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is""!!!
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Really like this brush. I had a Sonicare for the last three years but decided to try the OralB. They are both very different in their design but achieve similar effect. Very simple to use and cleans really well. Very happy with this purchase and would strongly recommend it.
"
"
Purchased this product to replace an older model I had .  I love it - works great.Was delivered within the time indicated.
"
"
Very well built. Lots of technology in a small package. It feels like you're at the dentist office.
"
"
I love this tooth brush!!! Of course it is a little bit expensive comparing to others, but it worths a shot. So far I've triedb two brushes and I love them. Totally recommend to people who have sensitive gums like I do. It will make you enjoy brushing your teeth.
"
"
Simply the best toothbrush I have ever used. Honestly my teeth are way whiter and whole mouth feels better just using it. Fabulous!!!!!
"
"
Operates exactly as wanted. Its good. No issues with anything.
"
"
Love the toothbrush and great results . Only thing I dont like is the big bulky handle body. Its hard to hang on too.
"
"
As described
"
"
J'ai dû remplacer ma brosse Oral B après 20 ans. Avec l'achat de Oral B 7000, vraiment le Meilleur achat que j'ai fait. Et j'aime beaucoup la minuterie qui nous pousse vraiment à faire un brossage de 2 minutes...même pressée, ça devient un devoir !
"
"
tres bien
"
"
This toothbrush does it all.
"
"
Works very well but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone... very important to follow instructions...excellent product.
"
"
good construction, warns user when too much pressure, clock/timer works about 8 months on two alkaline cells
"
"
This one is perfect. I so love it! It keeps me away from ""yellow"" teeth and cavity for everyday use.
"
"
Product works as described.
"
"
I can't believe I didn't make the jump years ago! It feels like a professional clean. Your teeth are so important, I'm glad I purchased this! Worth it!!
"
"
The whole family loves this brush even I have given up my sonics diamond clean to use this brush
"
"
The toothbrush does the job but the clock and bluetooth are un-used.
"
"
Excellente brosse à dent électrique
"
"
very good arrived as described
"
"
This is an excellent electric toothbrush. Mouth and teeth feel so much cleaner and fresher.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush that surpasses my oral b triumph largely. Easy to use and light. Should have bought it long ago.
"
"
Love this toothbrush and timer.  Highly recommend.
"
"
it can brush teeth, i was looking forward in using the app but its only on iphone and androids i believe so i paid extra for nothing
"
"
Love this
"
"
Incredible - even better than I expected. Have already recommended to others. The only complaint is that the spare brush heads that come included are not labelled but a quick google solved that problem.
"
"
Amazing. Simply amazing. You want your teeth cleaner and healthier. This helps you tons.
"
"
Very happy with this product, works amazing.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush, however I was a little disappointed that I couldn't tell the difference in power between the 5000 and the 7000.
"
"
a supricely good tooth brush works very well! I gave it a 4 cuz the small helper clock gaget  is pointless and the brush has a very long charge time when the power is low! The price is very hi to.
"
"
Love it
"
"
It does the job, but I can't find any difference from Sonicare.
"
"
Works well!  My son brushes his teeth better!
"
"
Cleans like a charm
"
"
Super nice package. No problem with charging. Have used it yesterday night, feeds great. Pressure sensitive help you to brush better.
"
"
Oral B always has good products, this may be a little more than I needed, but all good and the price was right
"
"
It was a gift so cant say much about the functionality but bought it because it had good reviews.
"
"
bon
"
"
Works great. Excellent battery life. It is my second Oral B rechargeable and I could not go back!
"
"
A decent toothbrush and worth the money when on sale. BT is of course more of a gimmick, but if the brush is for a child, it may come in handy.
"
"
Teeth love this tooth brush
"
"
My teeth thank me.
"
"
Seriously..love my toothbrush..totally rocks!!!
"
"
I wish I would have bought this 20 years ago. It is almost fun to brush my teeth now.
"
"
Bon produit bon prix

Works great.  Item delivered on time and works as expected.

Go for sonicare Diamond clean instead. you will not regret it.
"
"
Good product.I can't give 5 stars because it's very expensive product.
"
"
Excellente brosse a dents.
"
"
This is the best tooth brush. It took 12 hours too charge and cleans like nothing I have every used before. I would recommend it good buy
"
"
Everytime I used this toothbrush it felt like I just left the my dentist's office with a prefect cleaning!
"
"
even better I was thinking
"
"
Brosse bien les dents
"
"
Does an amazing job!  Has every bell and whistle you could ever want.  Has multiple cleaning settings and if you like to track your routine the app works well and is easy to use!
"
"
rien a redire
"
"
Very fun and effective! I feel as if my teeth are cleaner with even less effort.
"
"
Works great with the iPhone app. I'm sure I remember to brush more now with the app reminder. A bit pricy for what it does, but I'm happy with the purchase.
"
"
Good.
"
"
i'll never use a manual toothbrush again!
"
"
Super
"
"
My husband really like this one.
"
"
Love this product.  Teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing especially after the deep clean cycle.
"
"
Never going back to manual brushing. The different settings are great for all type of cleaning. In addition the travel case makes it easy to transport. Highly reccomentd.
"
"
It is great toothbrush, highly recommend
"
"
It's better than my previous Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush, so the product has improved with a new version.
"
"
Love all the different settings, especially the sensitive one. Dials the brush down a notch for those with sensitive teeth and gums.
"
"
This is a great product, feels as if you have came from a dentist every time. The only complaint I would have is the plastic base is a bit cheap and would be good if it was wall mountable.
"
"
It's no really worth to get the tooth brush with bule tooth device.The Brush it self is good enough to use.
"
"
amazing feel like just visited the DR.
"
"
I'm not good at brushing my teeth, so I find this to be incredibly helpful. I love the pressure sensor.
"
"
As described
"
"
Nice
"
"
good
"
"
Works great.
"
"
Very fast shipment and the quality of the product is very good. I tried as I got it. The experience was much better than I expected. Order another one for my mum.
"
"
Improves upon my former Braun unit. May take a week or two to achieve a proper evaluation but, at present, I am happy with it
"
"
over priced and bulky and heavy. other then that its ok
"
"
it is as good as any OralB that you can get for $20 or $50. extra bells and whistles on paper really.
"
"
Great toothbrush ever, I looooove it.
"
"
Great so far...at the on sale price I was able to get it for.
"
"
Excellent!  Price was fantastic as well.
"
"
Love this product!! Shines the teeth and keeps them white.
"
"
Easy to use but the phone app and and sync isn't very great.
"
"
my whole family uses it
"
"
Quiet while operating. A variety of settings. Love the travel case. Bluetooth is a bit over the top.
"
"
Très contant  de mon achat on sent vraiment la différence!
"
"
Best Oral B toothbrush I've used so far. The different modes and the alerts when pressing too hard helps me a lot to not ruined my gums!
"
"
Wokrs great!  the timer with smiley face would work great for kids also.  Nice product oral b
"
"
Bonne qualité et bon prix. De plus, la rapidité de la livraison était elle aussi très bonnePierre
"
"
Good product, Bluetooth settings is very helpful to set goals
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Feels like I go to the dentist daily! My only complaint is it's a little loud.
"
"
LOVE IT!!!!!
"
"
Great brush really enjoy it hope it last as long as my first on it lasted 8 years with two adults using it everyday and many holidays .
"
"
Amazing product...highly recommend it.
"
"
Perfect! I can feel my teeth are really clean. Love it!
"
"
Awesome.
"
"
This product is great! And how it tracks your brushing patterns and how it can switch from light to hard brushing, is really cool!Love the product!
"
"
Used it for over 2 years and still working :)
"
"
Just love it !!
"
"
​Simply the best electric toothbrush that I have ever used.
"

Great product. Everything is as its described and seems like it will be a durable.
"
"
Great tooth brush, battery lasts along time ideal for travel.
"
"
Me teeth are so clean and white, they feel smooth all day, i love it :)
"
"
stopped working after 25 days! I returned it.
"
"
The charger is only for 110-130 volts. Not 110-240 volts any more. Be careful when you travel with it.
"
"
Works great! Very good for travel. Fast delivery... So can't complain
"
"
I love it. Appears as it will last for years and years.
"
"
It cleans much better than regular toothbrush. Good buy.
"
"
Great toothbrush, but the clock is a bit extra.  I bought it cause it was sexy.
"
"
Works as expected, but overpriced.
"
"
Excellent product and Excellent Prie
"
"
Only it does NOT have Bluetooth. Still a good deal for the price.
"
"
Great quality at even greater price. Thanks!
"
"
Wanted to upgrade my toothbrush. My previous Braun was twenty years old !This one has a lot more features
"
"
I wasn't sure about the price but once I used it once I have no regrets.
"
"
Very nice product. works great.
"
"
Great deal and a great product, would buy again and recommend.

As my old Phillips Sonicare was giving it up and dying this week, i've found out it had a design flaw on it. On the Sonicare, the activation button is unfortunately not sealed so not waterproof.After a year and a half of daily use (2 times a day by 2 people), with water, saliva and toothpaste that got inside the mecanism, it started to rust and then PAWWW! The toothbrush wasn't working anymore.For those who never used an electric toothbrush, at first I wasn't understanding well what it was bringing more to brushing when using them but since I own one I had WAY LESS plaque and my visits at the dentist were far more ""fun"" and faster.So.... I won't suggest you the Phillips Sonicare after making a few searches, I've discovered I wasn't the only one to have the same trouble with them.After a few other searches and reviews reading, I've stumble on this really good quality model. The german Braun Oral-B Professional Care 7000.At first, it was way too much for my budget (240$ almost everywhere - Walmart, Future Shop, etc) until I've decided to give it a try on Amazon.ca and then I've found it here.The deal was amazing at 46% rebate (129$)It's one of the best electric toothbrush on the market.The head oscillates, rotates on itself and pulse. All that to stimulate your gums to prevent gingivitis and simultaneously removes deeply the plaque on your teeth.In addition, it comes with 3 different heads, a charging base and storage for your heads. It has a bluetooth brushing encouragement module (which suggests a 2-minute brushing - as all dentists do). It gives you the time (clock) when not in use. But when it sense that you've start your toothbrush, it automaticly starts a 2 min countdown showing you which quadrant of your teeth to brush.The toothbrush has 7 different modes of brushing, each adapting to your type of teeth, gum sensitivity, etc.It will tell you which quadrant of your mouth to brush and how long to brush it. It will also tell you if you push too hard on your gums by glowing a red light around the handle.Finally, it comes with a nice quality travel case (leather & metal) to protect your toothbrush and its heads when you're travelling abroad.For you, technology savvy, the toothbrush has a built-in Bluetooth module and can be connected to your cell phone (iPhone or Android) with the free app from Google Store or the AppStore.This means that you can download the application from Oral-B and your tooth brush will be connected to your cellphone, which helps you for a much more personalized brushing, controling every aspects of the brushing.With the application, you automatically will hold statistics about your daily brushing. Information that you can pass to your dentist at your next cleaning.Buy with confidence, it's a really good toothbrush you'll keep for years!
"
"
I must say that this is one fine product. Ive used other manufacturers but i was never happy with their devices. From performance to product quality. The 7000 is leaps and bounds above the ones i used before. Not sure how it stacks up against the 5000, but if its close then you may consider that model seeing that this model is pricey. Thats my only complaint thus far after a few weeks of use. I also dont find myself using the clock/timer that comes with it. But i must say that the quality behind the product is top notch, from the actual toothbrush to the carrying case and the other accessories. Very happy with my purchase. Love the warning light when im pressing too hard.
"

Product is annoying compared to my original Triumph from years ago.Here is what is wrong that made me angry:- We as a couple have one unit, with our own colour coded brushes ( which is why you have the colour personalization bands). However the Bluetooth app cannot track who is who making collecting stats for a couple, completely useless.The next major flaw is the lighting.  This brush has several blue LEDs thatlight up and stay on long after using your toothbrush, meaning the entire room is glowing blue at night if your master bedroom has anopen concept bathroom right next to it.  You have to put electrical tape around the lights - which provide little in funtionality.  Oral B just jumped on the LED bandwagon with no thought towards usability.The neoprene case is much much nicer than previous models, however does tend to stain slightly inside if any toothpaste rests on it overnight.

I got this tooth brush on time, so shipping was very good. However, I started using it and it really took forever to charge the battery to full bars. I thought maybe that's only happens the first time I charge it as it took three,,, yes,,, 3 days to fully charge. But it just kept doing the same thing until now. There is something wrong with the battery and they really need to have better quality control over these things as replacing the battery could be very costly and inconvenient. I used to have the 5000 series which had the indicator and you can see how much battery you have. This one you have to push the button to check the battery level.Also the Bluetooth doesn't start sending data to your iphone app and you have to enter everything manually which something that I really don't want to do when brushing early morning before heading out to work. I'm very disappointed.

Tough to rate really. I guess my ""iffy"" feelings could be someone else's awesome feeling about this. Not much "" wrong "" with it but I did return. Why?  Battery and charge time really surprised me at the length to charge. I know one can leave it on the stand to charge but my outlet is grounded so it shuts off with the light.  Not sure if that's me or most bathrooms so I guess I can't complain too much. I found the futuristic carry case and pouch and all that a little gimmicky.  I usually just tossed my old oral b electric in my shave kit. The Bluetooth??? Seriously???  Way gimmicky. Loading an app on your phone to monitor your habits is way way overkill for me. I didn't even bother with the headline news feature.  I don't need or want to bring my phone into the bathroom with me. So odd. I think this Bluetooth thing will backfire with this product. And just like my last brush, I didn't bother with the external brushing display. Another gimmicky piece to me. For fully swing on this you would have the brush going with the display and your phone. Too much IMHO. Having said all this, if you want to buy this, Amazon is the best price by a lot.  I did a comparison.  The 3000 model has the exact same ""motor"" and specs as the 7000 for $70 (a year of Amazon Prime) cheaper. So went that route. I won't miss the tongue cleaning mode. Or the deep clean mode or the extras.  All gimmicks.

I have owned an electric toothbrush for over a decade now. After a visit to my dentist, the hygienist recommended the Oral-B. I thought I'd give it a try, even though I was a big fan of the Sonicare. I bought a ""cheaper"" model and liked the Oral-B as soon as I started using it. When I saw the 7000 model, I decided to buy it because it offered many options (sensitive brush, white cleaning brush, tongue brush,...). Even though the price was high, I didn't regret buying it. It's worth every penny.
"

The charger is not working half the time I put the brush on it.  This happened 4 months after purchase which is just after the Amazon warranty period.  3 months is pretty short!  They told me to contact the manufacturer.  I emailed Oral B by they never responded.  I called them and they said to go to a service center.  The service Center said they will charge me for the repair even though it's under the Oral B warranty unless I email (form email) Oral B through their warranty department.  I emailed and again no response.If I had bough this at a store instead of Amazon I would have been able to exchange it for up to a year.  Buy it there instead.Lots of money to spend on an electric toothbrush that last as long as a standard toothbrush.
"

OK, this is a great toothbrush.  My previous model of this device lasted 10 years (with it being on the charger every day), and the battery finally reached the point where I could not brush my teeth for two minutes without it dying, so it was time to replace it.A couple of points.  First - the bluetooth seems like overkill but it does link to the clock and keep me on track for a thorough (3 minute on the + cycle) brushing.  I am not interested in linking this to my mobile device.  That would be overkill.The other thing that I miss from my old model was that with a press of the cycle button it would run at half speed when I was done brushing for cleaning the toothbrush.  This model is not so easy, and it takes several presses to find a mode that is less likely to spatter the tooth brushing foam.  However, that's a small complaint.It does stay charged for 7 days, with me using it twice a day for the 3 minute cycle each time.  Conveniently it flashes a yellow colour at the end of brushing to indicate it needs a charge.  Recharging basically takes 24 hours.Can't say as I am into using the other attachments other than the floss action head.  That I do like, which I find better than the standard heads. I will be switching once I use up the ones I have.Yes, it's an expensive toothbrush.  Consider that it will last you 10 years, and then the cost is a little more palatable.Those on a budget should perhaps consider a lesser model with the same brushing speeds, but less features.I'll use this brush (or it's next model 10 years from now) for the rest of my life.BTW, I get great check ups.

Purchased for 134.99 before tax some time in June 2016.Pros:- Comes with a clock and syncs schedule brushing on Oral App (clock is a handy feature in the washroom!)- Lots of features which include tongue cleaning, deep cleaning, massage for gums and many more- Teeth definitely feels much cleaner than a regular toothbrush, slipper teeth when you run your tongue on them!- Very powerful - might feel gum soreness for the first few days of use which is normal which means its very thorough and does a good job of cleaning away plaqueCons:- Takes forever to charge! Almost 3 whole days but I guess it last very long so its not too bad (won't be too bad if you charge it everyday)- The light is very bright (if you charge in your room, it could get annoying)10/10 would recommend this tooth brush!

Replacement for a 6 year-old version.  The pressure sensitivity sensor, with its red light, is really not needed.  The timer device, and bluetooth connectivity appear to be quite needless.  The case is roughly 2x the volume of previous version (travel impact).  Notwithstanding these comments, the Braun electric toothbrush is a great toothbrush.  My pref, build a version with a larger battery, market it in this way.

best price and best toothbrush out there.  after every brushing i feel like i just got back from the dentist office.  best electric tooth brush ever.

Good product!It was a gift for my wife. She likes it overall; but, she mentioned it to me that the battery does not last as long as her previous one, which was a different brand purchased in Germany.This one lasts around 1 week; the previous one could last about 1 month.Still, she is very happy with this!

My old Oral B that I had for more than 10 years died a few weeks ago and I replaced it with this more recent model. It is much lighter to hold than the older model. The On/off switch button is not well positioned, but other than this, it is quieter and cleans teeth efficiently. I'm pleased with my purchase!

I have been using this toothbrush for over a year now.  Overall it works very well.  The little timer is a gimmick.  it is neat at first but once the batteries run out you probably won't bother using anymore.  However the brush itself works great.  It comes with a selection of heads that match the different settings on the brush.  I have had no issues with the battery.  It lasts long enough for a week long trip.  The travel case is a bit bulky but very solid.  I make sure to drain the battery completely every couple months as it is not a lithium battery.  If you do that the battery should last for years.

Honestly, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Amazing product at a great price.Background: My electric oral-b toothbrush from Braun had lasted me almost 10 years before it died so I've been eyeing the 7000 series the last few months. The price was originally well over $200 which is quite off-putting but as soon as it went on special I decided to pull the trigger.Pros:The toothbrush itself feels amazing in your hand, light and easy to maneuver, and packs a lot of power. Even though I was using what I thought was an excellent electric toothbrush for the last decade this one blows it out of the water. Not only that but the timer really helps me focus on quadrants in my mouth to ensure good hygiene and I've really kept up with it so far. The extra modes etc make it really easy to take good care of your mouth. Honestly, the brush itself gives me no reason whatsoever to complain.Cons:There are none on the brush itself. The bluetooth connectivity, which easy and flawless, is slightly redundant given the timer that they give you with the brush but the app is well made and well designed and feels really good. I was impressed by the effort they put into the app but I am not sure how much I will be using it.The other major/minor con is the cost of the additional heads. As you know you can get 5 heads for $30ish dollars right now which is not bad but its certainly not cheap and add to the longterm cost associated with the toothbrush. I wish oral-b would reach out to long lasting customers and provide incentives and discounts but alas this is a minor quibble. If you can afford this tooth brush you can afford the heads.Summary:Excellent toothbrush overall. The plastics used, the quality of workmanship, the ability to clean my teeth - they are all excellent. I could not be happier with the performance. The cost right now is very reasonable given the long life I am expecting from this device; the extra heads and travel case are a nice bonus thrown in there too. I would seriously urge anyone and everyone to consider purchasing this product, you will not be disappointed.

I have brushed with a manual toothbrush for 24-years, for at least 5 minutes twice (*cough* that's debatable) per day. When working shift-work, brushing can feel like a chore at times. My dentist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush years ago-- I finally pulled the trigger recently. Honestly, this was really an impulse buy; however, I'm glad I made the purchase.I use the 2-minute mode on the brush (down from my 5-minute routine with a manual brush). At first 2-minutes felt like nothing; however, my teeth have never felt this clean before (aside from when going to the dentist for a cleaning). I guess I've been brushing the wrong way for 24-years, FML haha.I HATE brushing, and push it to the last minute before bed. Sometimes this procrastination drags on until 1am when I have to be awake at 5:30am. It's weird to say, but I actually enjoying brushing with this toothbrush. There's no effort involved; you can just hold it in your mouth while you're still half asleep and still get a better than average clean.I normally don't review products as I couldn't care less about wasting my time on such a thing; however, since this essentially opened my eyes to oral hygiene, and that brushing doesn't have to feel like a chore, I chose to add a review. I'm actually pretty anal (can we even say that?) when it comes to brushing now.

Pros: Good quality product, easy to use,versatile ,  looks goodCons: noneWorth the investment

Give me a break ..it's just a really expensive toothbrush for my 86 year old husband and I can't figure out how the clock works or how to set the toothbrush ..or co-ordinate it with a smart phone ..or whatever ...was just looking for one with a brush that went in a circle not back and forth movement ..and there were not many to choose from. I told my husband, put toothpaste on the brush, put it in your mouth and use it ..enough already!

Had the older model and see a significant difference with the newer version. This one seems to rotate faster and leaves teeth feeling very clean.

The toothbrush works great but I thought being Bluetooth it would be more interactive! The toothbrush comes with three heads, a charger, a mount to hold toothbrush and heads and a timer. You connect to an app which sync with the toothbrush and you can choose one of their programs which will remind you of proper brushing. On the app, during sync it will give you 30 second for each section: top left bottom left top right bottom right and then the remainder timing on your front teeth. While sync to the app it definitely helps keep you on the min 2 min brush time recommended but I am yet to figure out the value or purpose of the timer/clock thing. I thought it was a timer but it does it thing and randomly smiles and counts time and then countdown etc etc and my box did not come with a manual so not sure how to fix it. Anyway good product overall to keep you on track for brushing but don't see any value to the timer included with toothbrush.

The kit comes packed with accessories, as expected from a high end electric tooth brush from Oral B. However, in my package I was missing 2x brush heads. According to Oral B's website, the kit should have come with 5 brush heads:- 2 CrossAction Brush Heads- 1 ProWhite Brush Head- 1 FlossAction Brush Head- 1 Sensitive Clean Brush HeadMy kit only came with 3:- 1 CrossAction Brush Head (preinstalled on handle)- 1 ProWhite Brush Head- 1 Sensitive Clean Brush HeadFelt a bit cheated because of the missing 2 brush heads but a quick chat with Amazon Canada quickly resolved that.In addition to the supposedly 5 brush heads, you also get the following:- 1 Oral-B Pro 7000 Handle- 1 ""Premium"" Charger (LOL) with Refill Head Storage- 1 Premium Travel Case- 1 Travel Pouch- 1 SmartGuideThe handle itself is excellent and is well crafted. The build is excellent and feels like it's worth its price. It's got alot of various modes for all your brushing needs. The travel carry case is indeed worthy of the title ""premium"". It is a hard carry case that feels like a carry case for very expensive glasses. It also comes with a small travel pouch which I assume would be for the travel charger. The new SmartGuide pretty much works like the old one that came with my Oral B Pro 5000. Beyond cosmetic changes, I think the guts are the same. The handle, brush heads, charger, and SmartGuide are all made in Germany. Only the travel case is made in China.I see alot of people complaining about the 7000 still using nimh batteries instead of li-ion. I've have had a Vitality, a 1000 and a 5000 for a good couple years already.  All of them had nimh batteries and they are all still alive and working to this day. I can't say the same for my most of my older smartphones (using lithium ion batteries) which either cannot keep charge or the batteries swelled up considerably.  I have no complaints about whatever Oral B is doing for their tooth brushes as long as they remain reliable.Finally, my only complaint about this toothbrush is the charger. This so called ""premium"" travel charger still only works at 110V to 130V which makes it useless for many parts in Europe. Come on Oral B, why is your top of the line tooth brush still using the same crap as your cheapo handles? I mean I'm looking at my the charger that came with my $20 Oral B Vitality tooth brush and it looks identical to this one and operate at the same voltages. What's the point of all those fancy travel accessories if the charger don't even work for traveling (unless you travel exclusively in North America and wherever else that uses that 110V to 130V voltage range). Knocking one star for that.I got the new 7000 because of the bluetooth/smartphone connectivity feature but turns out I never bring my phone with me when I brush my teeth, so I ended up never using that. I actually did try but it felt like such a chore. Maybe if your phone is close to your bathroom, it could work. The SmartGuide works well enough for me to not miss this feature.

Amazing!I bought this item for my wife. She has notoriously bad teeth and constantly has cavities which is costing a fortune in dental bills. Since buying this for christmas for her it has turned all that around. Not a single issue with her teeth (its been more than a year) and her dentist is thoroughly impressed. I was so impressed that I gave it a try myself. I have never imagined that an electric toothbrush could be worth this much money but I am now a believer.The grip is smooth on the unit but I find the crescent shape of the grip a little odd in my larger hands. the interchangeable heads are a great bonus and the handy holder on the charging base is a plus. I find the carrying case is very nice and we have used it often when visiting family. the bluetooth computer display that accompanies this product is a fun gadget. my wife was hell bent on getting a perfect score (rated by pressure and duration of brushing) and it does a handy countdown of 2 minutes with a grid to indicate what quadrant of the mouth to brush. I found this very helpful despite thinking it was unnecessary at first.I dont find a difference in the brushing heads (pulishing brushing...) despite several trials. Its nice to have the extra heads so that I can have my own however. It holds a charge very well, allowing a dozen brushings before needing to be returned to its base. This is handy as you dont have to lug the base on every trip you take, just fully charge and good for a week or more.I would highly recommend this brush for anyone regardless of oral hygiene. It will improve your brushing habits and provide a great cleaning in the process.

I love this toothbrush. I went from having a lower end electric toothbrush that was dying to this. What a world of difference. The bells and whistles are cool, but not necessary. The little timer/clock thing is fantastic! I haven't used the Bluetooth more than a few times, but I use the timer/clock every time I brush my teeth. I'd say this is the Cadillac of toothbrushes.
"
"
I didn't order it from Amazon but I do have one of these and the Bluetooth stopped connecting just after the 1 year mark. Would be a great toothbrush if the technology worked. Yes, I tried it on multiple devices (both Android and Apple) it just won't connect to anything anymore, including the timer device that's included in the box.
"
"
After just over a year the battery is almost gone.  So the need for the fancy travel case is definitely not needed as I can't take it anywhere unless I'm packing the charger.  For someone who travels a lot, this is not ideal.  I don't use the fancy travel case any more as its heavy and bulky - a bad combo for travelling.I have used Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes for over 20 years as this is by far the most disappointing model I've owned.  Its also one of the most expensive.  I definitely would not buy it again and certainly not in black as it highlights any toothpaste residue.
"
"
I bought this thinking it would be able to last much longer on a charge and be able to perform better than the basic Oral-B electric toothbrushes, boy was I wrong! I find that I still sometimes have to use my manual toothbrush after using the electric brush. I actually regret not trying the competitor instead. Given the high price, I would not recommend this product.
"
"
Best electronic toothbrush out there! The app does sometimes stop working but honestly who really needs an app to brush their teeth? You can see and feel the quality of this toothbrush & the accessories. I thought the timer would be useless but I have to say it's really practical in knowing how much time is left for each quadrant of you mouth. Tong cleaning option is also really cool and does work. Just waiting for another sale so that my wife and I can have our own...
"
"
Great product, forces us to brush our teeth consistently and keeps our progress in the APP.I was skeptical about a bluetooth toothbrush but i do not regret the purchase. it won me over after using it just once.We'll see how it goes on the long run, satisfied for now.

This is our 3rd Oral-B electric toothbrush. My wife and I have always been partial towards them as the smaller round head of the Oral-B system worked best for us in cleaning tight, hard to reach areas such as wisdom teeth.We've owned a basic Oral-B model many years ago that we eventually replaced with the Oral-B Professional Care Triumph about 6 years ago. The Triumph is the predecessor to the current Professional Care 5000 and also came with the Smart Guide.Our Triumph served us well. The battery eventually started losing charge, lasting only a few days before needing a recharge. More critically, the plastic started to chip around the top causing the head to twist somewhat loosely, so it was time to replace it.We compared the 5000 and 7000 and really had a hard time choosing until Amazon.com (U.S. site) put the 7000 on sale while at the same time Oral-B was giving an additional $30-off via an instant online coupon, making it cheaper than the 5000 so I decided to order it.Even with the exchange rate, shipping to Canada, taxes and duty etc... it came to ~$30 less than the lowest Amazon.ca price, which itself was significantly cheaper than all Canadian brick and mortar stores (which were all selling for above $200). And to my surprise the package that came was the full retail Canadian packaging with both English and French text, manuals and included both US and Canadian warranty.There are two disappointing things about the 7000 that I should mention:1. The battery is still NiMH. I had hoped that Oral-B had finally transitioned to Lithium Ion but they haven't.2. The included AC charger is 110V only. My old Triumph included a world charger (100V-240V) which now Oral-B sells separately.These might be deal breakers for some but I knew going in about them and they didn't impact us. First, our old Triumph also had a NiMH battery and with proper care (e.g. complete discharge every 6 months) it easily lasted 5+ years; by that time we started seeing other, more pressing, physical breakdowns necessitating a replacement. Second, the 10-day battery life on the 7000 covers most of our trips outside North America.Now if you can live with these two limitations then you're in for a real treat with this toothbrush. Compared to our old Triumph, which we still consider it to be a great toothbrush, this one just trumps it in most respects.It's thinner and lighter yet Oral-B managed to somehow retain, if not improve, the feel in the hand. The outer casing has rubbery parts and is more sticky (in a good way) than the Triumph which was very slippery especially when wet. Operation wise, button layout, modes etc... are almost identical (the 7000 has one additional mode than the 5000 - 6 modes in total) making it really easy to pick up and use without even reading the manual - it's very intuitive.The toothbrush, shockingly, took almost 24 hours to fully charge from a complete discharge state, which is much, much slower than any of our previous toothbrushes. This is partly due to the use of a NiMH-type battery, but more likely I think Oral-B went to a new charging model (old Triumph charger does not work with the new 7000) where it now trickle charges instead of the old fast charge method. Upon further researching, if it is indeed true that this new charger is a trickle-type charger, then it's a good thing as evidence suggests that trickle charging these types of batteries not only reduces heat and wear on the battery but can in most cases significantly prolong battery life and charge cycles. Maybe that's Oral-B's small way of combating long term battery issues without going to Lithium Ion.The new Smart Guide is a little smaller but unlike the old one which when sitting its LCD display was angled slightly up, making it easy to read, this one sits with its face perpendicular to the surface so when looking down on it the display is a little faded. It comes with a clear mounting apparatus that allows you to have it mounted on a bathroom mirror. I found that with the mounting apparatus installed, but without actually mounting it to a mirror, you can have it sit on the counter with the display angled slightly up, making it much easier to read and this became our preferred placement option.While it is nice to see the timer and sequence of mouth quadrants while brushing, I don't think the Smart Guide adds much value overall. However we do find that it makes a great bathroom clock so that's handy.The travel case that's included is really nice. So nice in fact that I almost feel like I need a case for the case. The inner lining is removable and can be washed in a dishwasher.The kit included three different Oral-B brush-heads. Our favorite is the Floss Action; one of which is included.Up to four brush-heads can be stored neatly on the charging base and each brush-head, as with most Oral-B units, can have a different colored ring on the bottom to differentiate individual ones (his, hers etc...).But where it counts the most, teeth cleaning and gum massaging performance, is where ultimately one decides whether this is a good buy or not. And boy is this ever great in those regards. After using it the first time, my teeth and gums felt phenomenal, got that tingly sensation back (that one you get right after a thorough cleaning by a dental hygienist). I had used my old Triumph merely a few hours earlier, using the same head, and the difference was night and day. The pulsations on the 7000 felt noticeably smoother and tighter than our Triumph. My wife felt exactly the same way after her first brushing. We threw away our trusty old Triumph immediately after that.This is by far the best electric toothbrush we have ever used. I highly recommend it. My only gripes are that Oral-B stuck with NiMH batteries and they no longer include a world-adapter. For the asking price, I think it's only reasonable to expect those two shortcomings be addressed. Despite this, we still gave this brush 5-stars based on its most important virtue, performance.
"

I don't ever use the Bluetooth functionality, but the brush itself is terrific. The various modes are handy, especially for sensitive teeth/gum - and it looks nice!
"
"
This is only used by me, one person.  So it's not from over-use.  I only charge the toothbrush when the battery indicator is low and I charge for a day or overnight, just like most devices should be done.  I don't leave it on for longer than 8 hours.  After less than a year of use, it no longer charges.  I place it on the charging base and the charging light does not go on, nor does it charge. I regret not buying the warranty.
"
"
Product is seriously flawed, had the toothbrush replaced twice because it would either not charge or not hold the charge.  The third one just gave out as well, it won't charge either while it's only four months old.  Obviously thisis not a one off issue.  As Amazon doesn't except a return after four months I now have a $ 150 manual toothbrush......Update: Amazon just offered to have me ship the item back for a refund, as apparently I'm not the only one that has had problems.  So 1 star for Oral-B for selling a flawed product and 4 stars for Amazon as they offered a proper solution.
"
"
I’ve had this toothbrush for well over 2 years now. It. Is. AMAZING! Worth every 5 cent coin. The cleaning action has saved me from whitening my teeth as much as I used to.The brush warning is great at letting me know I’m being too aggressive by flashing red and has helped with my gum recession. My dentist has seen a difference and I haven’t had a cavity in over 2 years.It’s very durable and has traveled the world with me. The battery is still in good shape.I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone interested in improving their oral health routine.
"
"
This is a Christmas gift so I can’t comment yet on how it works or opinions of the actual product, but when I opened the amazon box the Oral-B box inside was already open and had a small tear. Not something you really like to see when you’re gifting something and it’s such a personal item. Was it returned? Did someone else already have it opened and changed their mind?  If so did they actually handle the toothbrush?  The box should have been closed and sealed. The next time I see it in store I will be looking to see if they are sealed.
"
"
I have had the 5000 series and wanted to upgrade to the 7000. While I don't see a significant difference in the two especially for the money spent, it is still a very good brush. I do like the fact it works with their APP to keep track but the OralB app needs a significant amount of work for this product to actually be worthwhile to have bluetooth.  However if you are debating between the 5000 or 7000 just buy the 5000 you won't see any difference for the price you pay for this one. Sure it has a nicer case for taking it with you but outside of that there just is no differential between them in terms of what an average person would use it for - unless you really need the 7 different cleaning modes.

This is my first electric toothbrush, after considering one for a few years. I’ve been using it for a week now, and I can honestly say that my teeth have never felt so squeaky clean. The brush is easy to use and I’m extremely pleased. I purchased a few extra brush heads to use, in addition to the 3 basic brushes that came with the set. I’m overall impressed by how well the brush reach the gumline and also clean around my crown. I don’t use the Bluetooth connection to the app. While some people might find it useful to understand the amount of time to brush each quadrant and the amount of pressure applied to each tooth. I find this as big-time overkill. I don’t need this amount of info. Some might but in retrospect, I could have purchased the unit without the Bluetooth feature.Overall, I am extremely satisfied. This is one of the absolute best hygiene purchases I’ve ever made. I’m so happy I took the dive into an advanced level of dental care that is so easy too! My future dental appointment are already thanking me in advance!
"
"
I have always been skeptical about electric toothbrushes. ""Why should I need one, as long as I have a good pair of hands?"" was my argument. Then, one day I bought this toothbrush quite by impulse, and that changed my entrenched notion for good.I simply love this toothbrush! First, it is like having your own dental hygienist right in your washroom. Second, the brush is well built; six months on, it  works as good as it did the day I purchased it! I complement my brushing with flossing, and use mouth wash. That is as good as it gets!
"
"
What can I say that hasn't already been said about this fantastic set?You get what you pay for, and with the exception of the portable carrying case, the included products are made in Germany, which, is a premier manufacturer of quality goods.To claim that Braun went all out with their most expensive electric toothbrush package would be an understatement in my opinion.  Much of the included goodies weren't necessary, but absolutely welcomed and appreciated!Furthermore, I realize the Bluetooth feature which allows for the connection and synchronization of this fabulous toothbrush with a free smartphone app (available for iOS and Android operating systems) is not something most owners consider essential, but I would beg to differ, because as someone who ""suffers"" from 'Gadget Fever,' and, someone who likes to adhere to a punctual daily schedule, I absolutely LOVE this feature!Overall, I'd have to consider this product to be tied for numero uno with the obvious contender from Philips, which, I also happen to own (but have worn out, hence, the purchase of its main competitor's flagship offering).TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read): a solid 5/5 and highly recommended!Have yourselves a wonderful day, and be sure to treat your teeth like royalty, because if there's one thing above all which our elders seem to regret with respect to their lifestyle choices (or lack there of), I swear that the topic of inadequate dental hygiene has reigned supreme in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).

I bought this a year ago around Christmas and after using the brush every day for 365 days we can say I truly love it.This system does help to get your teeth feeling really clean and well taken care of. We only charge it when the light flashes on the base to remind us to and so it holds a charge very well. On average we charge it only 1x every 7-10 days or so depending.The little clock that syncs to the brush - the batteries died about 11 months after we bought it, but that's an easy fix.

This is a great toothbrush. I have been using the deep clean setting and can notice a difference in the way my teeth feel. Almost like when you get your teeth cleaned at the dentist. Everyday they feel great. I think there is lots of things in the box that I won’t use, it comes with 2 cases which will be nice when I travel. The 3 different brush heads and nice too, you can see which one you like best and order those. It comes with a little battery powered timer thing that I believe tells you how your brushing is going, I have not used that. The charging takes 24 hours but I think you can go a few weeks on a charge so that is no problem.
"

This is only used by me, one person.  So it's not from over-use.  I only charge the toothbrush when the battery indicator is low and I charge for a day or overnight, just like most devices should be done.  I don't leave it on for longer than 8 hours.  After less than a year of use, it no longer charges.  I place it on the charging base and the charging light does not go on, nor does it charge. I regret not buying the warranty.

Product is seriously flawed, had the toothbrush replaced twice because it would either not charge or not hold the charge.  The third one just gave out as well, it won't charge either while it's only four months old.  Obviously thisis not a one off issue.  As Amazon doesn't except a return after four months I now have a $ 150 manual toothbrush......Update: Amazon just offered to have me ship the item back for a refund, as apparently I'm not the only one that has had problems.  So 1 star for Oral-B for selling a flawed product and 4 stars for Amazon as they offered a proper solution.

I’ve had this toothbrush for well over 2 years now. It. Is. AMAZING! Worth every 5 cent coin. The cleaning action has saved me from whitening my teeth as much as I used to.The brush warning is great at letting me know I’m being too aggressive by flashing red and has helped with my gum recession. My dentist has seen a difference and I haven’t had a cavity in over 2 years.It’s very durable and has traveled the world with me. The battery is still in good shape.I would HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone interested in improving their oral health routine.
"
"
This is a Christmas gift so I can’t comment yet on how it works or opinions of the actual product, but when I opened the amazon box the Oral-B box inside was already open and had a small tear. Not something you really like to see when you’re gifting something and it’s such a personal item. Was it returned? Did someone else already have it opened and changed their mind?  If so did they actually handle the toothbrush?  The box should have been closed and sealed. The next time I see it in store I will be looking to see if they are sealed.

I have had the 5000 series and wanted to upgrade to the 7000. While I don't see a significant difference in the two especially for the money spent, it is still a very good brush. I do like the fact it works with their APP to keep track but the OralB app needs a significant amount of work for this product to actually be worthwhile to have bluetooth.  However if you are debating between the 5000 or 7000 just buy the 5000 you won't see any difference for the price you pay for this one. Sure it has a nicer case for taking it with you but outside of that there just is no differential between them in terms of what an average person would use it for - unless you really need the 7 different cleaning modes.

This is my first electric toothbrush, after considering one for a few years. I’ve been using it for a week now, and I can honestly say that my teeth have never felt so squeaky clean. The brush is easy to use and I’m extremely pleased. I purchased a few extra brush heads to use, in addition to the 3 basic brushes that came with the set. I’m overall impressed by how well the brush reach the gumline and also clean around my crown. I don’t use the Bluetooth connection to the app. While some people might find it useful to understand the amount of time to brush each quadrant and the amount of pressure applied to each tooth. I find this as big-time overkill. I don’t need this amount of info. Some might but in retrospect, I could have purchased the unit without the Bluetooth feature.Overall, I am extremely satisfied. This is one of the absolute best hygiene purchases I’ve ever made. I’m so happy I took the dive into an advanced level of dental care that is so easy too! My future dental appointment are already thanking me in advance!

I have always been skeptical about electric toothbrushes. ""Why should I need one, as long as I have a good pair of hands?"" was my argument. Then, one day I bought this toothbrush quite by impulse, and that changed my entrenched notion for good.I simply love this toothbrush! First, it is like having your own dental hygienist right in your washroom. Second, the brush is well built; six months on, it  works as good as it did the day I purchased it! I complement my brushing with flossing, and use mouth wash. That is as good as it gets!
"
"
What can I say that hasn't already been said about this fantastic set?You get what you pay for, and with the exception of the portable carrying case, the included products are made in Germany, which, is a premier manufacturer of quality goods.To claim that Braun went all out with their most expensive electric toothbrush package would be an understatement in my opinion.  Much of the included goodies weren't necessary, but absolutely welcomed and appreciated!Furthermore, I realize the Bluetooth feature which allows for the connection and synchronization of this fabulous toothbrush with a free smartphone app (available for iOS and Android operating systems) is not something most owners consider essential, but I would beg to differ, because as someone who ""suffers"" from 'Gadget Fever,' and, someone who likes to adhere to a punctual daily schedule, I absolutely LOVE this feature!Overall, I'd have to consider this product to be tied for numero uno with the obvious contender from Philips, which, I also happen to own (but have worn out, hence, the purchase of its main competitor's flagship offering).TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read): a solid 5/5 and highly recommended!Have yourselves a wonderful day, and be sure to treat your teeth like royalty, because if there's one thing above all which our elders seem to regret with respect to their lifestyle choices (or lack there of), I swear that the topic of inadequate dental hygiene has reigned supreme in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area).

Cette brosse va beaucoup mieux que ma oral-b à 40$. Elle vibre plus. La pile dure au moins 1 semaines, sans que la qualité du brossage diminue. J’aime la minuterie incluse qui affiche le temps de brossage(en autre temps, l’heure). J’aime aussi l’option qui permet de faire une vibration aux 30 secondes afin de changer de zone. Et le limiteur de pression fonctionne très bien, si on pèse trop fort, la brosse ralenti, une lumière allume et un vibration se fait.
"

[I bought it July 2018 and the bluetooth stopped working December 23 2019. I'm going to see if I can find my warranty to get it repaired.]EDIT: actually, I did figured out what was wrong. My toothbrush had the bluetooth function turned off by accident and I didn't even know you could do that. I just had to hold both buttons down for 2 seconds and it was fixed. It missed a few days of recording my brush times because of this.
"
"
I really like the job this toothbrush does, but I'm not happy with the battery life (roughly a week). The charger is not convenient to keep in our bathroom, so I have to charge it in another room. And the case does not charge it, so if I travel (and I travel frequently) I have to bring the charger too.If you have room to leave it in the charger all the time, and never (rarely) travel, it does a fantastic job on your teeth, and has multiple modes to ensure you get a great job done.

Great brush I dont use the app but have had it for almost 4 years and it's still going strong no issues at all . I buy the large replacement brushhead pack from costco and it last be about a year or more.My dentist has noticed a difference too also love the traveling case. Have gone on vacations for 2 weeks and works on a single charge would definitely reccomend . I share it with my fiancee the brushes have a color coding system so you wont be confused about who's is who.Would definitely get 100 percent great product
"
"
It is just OK. But I had used the diamond clean and it both, so it is so easy for me to compare them, I chose diamond clean over it, because somehow this product is not strong enough to make my teeth clean enough as the other product did. There is advantage however, it has clock to make you aware your timing of brushing, and their replacement heads are cheaper
"
"
This is one of my favourite things I bought and it has the amazing app for your phone which helps just track all the details of your of your brushing it it’s it’s Gary did it so it’s really really good and it makes brushing teeth kind of fun so someone who used to hate manually brushing his teeth and now brushing their teeth all the time because of this little vanity thing that does the super efficient job and when I go the dentist my dentist tells me there are no problems and I really attribute most of that to the Oral-B
"
"
Decided to buy oral-b instead of Philips sonicare, I regret it. After 1 year of purchase, my toothbrush is completely dead, won't charge nor start up no matter how hard I try to get it to work. Before this point, the toothbrush was already giving me a few issues such as turning itself off constantly. It would turn itself off at least 5 times in 2 minutes of brushing my teeth, extremely frustrating. Don't bother with this toothbrush unless you're eager to replace your electric toothbrush every year.
"
"
I have been looking for a great toothbrush in a long time. This works perfectly and really does an incredible job. I never felt my teeth so clean in my life, honestly. It has great power, battery lasts for a while, even on vacation without charger, it holds charges for twice a day 2 weeks brushing.It is powerful, well built and durable !I have been very pleased with this product wince I bought it last year. It worked so great, I had to buy one for my wife !! :) We both love them !I highly recommend, especially at deal price I saw last week, I paid around 180$ CAD for each of ours and it is REALLY worth every penny I invested !PLUS: MADE IN GERMANYVery good pick ! You won't regret it !
"
"
Best to use before this before your neighbors’ bedtime hours as they will most definitely hear you and think you’re brushing your teeth with a jackhammer.Don’t think this is an ultrasonic brush as this is basically a power tool for your teeth.Battery doesn’t last as long and you’ll have to charge it at least 2X a week.Overall a very Meh purchase.
"
"
I love it. Mine came with 3 heads. So me and my daughter uses it. Teeth feel a lot more cleaner. I don't understand the timer they provided with it and haven't connected it to any bluetooth. I've had for a few months now. I travel with it a lot. So far the longest ive had it without charge has been 5 days. It didn't die on me so I'm sure i could have used it a another 2 days

Upgraded my old Oral B toothbrush. Love this thing. I thought it was pretty silly with bluetooth and that screen but at the time it was on a crazy sale so I got it (hey I'm an early adopter:) If you already have had an Oral B electric toothbrush you know what to expect. I've been using these for years, never had a cavity.I really haven't used the bluetooth connectivity with my phone because, come on. But I'll give it a shot sometime. The display with the happy face I also thought was gimmicky, but you know what? It immediately made me conscious of how short my typical tooth brushing session is and more often than not successfully incentivizes me to go the full two minutes. My teeth are happy as is my dentist.The carrying case is also great for travelling, though it's a bit bulkier than it really needs to be and sadly doesn't hold the charger. That said, I've gotten away with being on the road a week or two without charging the thing (and the case keeps it from turning on and draining in my luggage).
"

This brush provides a professional level of cleaning at home and I'm glad I decided to buy it. I hadn't noticed that my previous electric toothbrush wasn't holding a charge as well, and wasn't as powerful as it had seemed, until I decided to order this one. Not only does it have various settings, such as deep clean and tongue clean, it comes with three different brush heads, a sturdy travel case, and the clock/timer which helps you keep track of your brushing time. It apparently lets you know if you're applying too much pressure but I haven't encountered this yet. I have found it much easier to track my brushing time as sometimes the standard intermittent change in vibration is easy to ignore if you're not focusing on it. The smiley face and stars when you've brushed enough are a nice touch, even if you're an adult. Overall, I'm happy with this item. It does seem to need more frequent charging than I expected, but I'm not sure if I'm just brushing longer, or if I may need to contact Oral B. I've only been using it a couple of weeks, and have to determine if the battery is functioning as it should, and will need to update my review.

I never would have thought I would spend over $100 on a tooth brush, however my dentist recommended that I get a real electric toothbrush not the $12 spin brushes I was using. I was keeping my eye out for a sale and I finally picked this up on Amazon's black friday sale for $120, (over $100 off). I have been using it for a few weeks now. Both my wife and I share the brush and we have our colour coded brush heads that we can keep in the handy stand, and we even made use of the traveling case for a recent weekend getaway.As for the toothbrush itself, I like the timer it indicates the different modes you are in and the time for each brushing zone. I especially like the pressure sensor, while the brush itself does flash a red light when you brush too hard, you are able to see the pressure sensor warning (i.e the frowning face) on the timer display unit more easily. My only con so far, is the brush itself does not indicate which mode it's in, so you must rely on the timer display, which could be problematic if you are traveling and don't want to carry the extra device. I've only tried the floss action head so far, not the whitening head.Overall I am happy with the results, although I don't have experience with other high end toothbrushes. The real results will be when I go for my next cleaning at the dentists office.--------------*UPDATE*Visited the dentist office for a regular cleaning after a few months of use with this and a few months of use with my old brush. They said they noticed a big improvment in my teeth and asked me what I was doing differently. All i've done was switch from a Crest spin brush to this. Also I notice that when I floss my teeth after using this toothbrush I dont have to remove much buildup from between the teeth. i.e the brush gets most of the 'in between' ..

Cette brosse à dent avec tête remplaçable et support convient à toute la famille puisque chaque membre peut avoir sa brossette. La fonction Bluetooth ne m’est pas très utile mais la brosse est tout de meme excellent et contient de nombreux programmes.
"

I love this toothbrush. It makes my teeth feel very clean. I like that it comes with three different brush heads to try out with one you like best. I've seen it one sale at $125 on amazon a month or two ago, so I recommend waiting to buy it instead of buying it full price. I haven't used the app because I don't feel like I need it. This is my first electric toothbrush, and I'm never going back to a manual one!
"
"
It's a great unit overall, it cleans very well. I have only two issues with it, which are the following:- You cannot know which option you are own, basically you have to always carry that small LCD with you- You cannot charge with the travel case, that means you have to bring the stand with you.
"
"
I bought this because I have had quite a lot of treatment on my teeth recently and my friends and family who have got an electric toothbrush have said they feel it's contributed to improvements in their dental health. The price initially put me off but I thought buying an expensive toothbrush would encourage me to use all it's features and, although I've only had it 3 weeks, it has. It's really easy to set up, although takes about 24 hours to fully charge for the first time and the features are helpful. It comes with 3 different brushes, a regular brush, whitening and tongue cleaner. The timer feature is really helpful for me. I like that it vibrates when 30 seconds has passed so you know when to brush a different quadrant of your mouth, and if you apply to much pressure a red light comes on. At 2 minutes the brush pulses again to let you know when you're done. To be able to monitor my progress on the App is super helpful and hopefully it means I'm getting better habits. It has cute features personalized for you too like it displays, news, weather etc., I assume to distract you from over concentrating on brushing. It also has a smart travel case which looks good. As I said, I've only had it for a few weeks so time will tell but, so far so good!
"

A great purchase - worth every penny paid! I used battery operated Oral B toothbrushes previously. Can't believe the difference now with this electric Oral B. Like comparing a machine gun to a toy pistol. Easy to get used to from the outset.Beneficial having a personal timer matched to it - ensures proper usage time-wise. It performs as advertised - with no problems at all so far. Quality seems to be good!
"
"
I used the brush 4 times since I bought it and I have to admit I'm extremely impressed; I'm noticing my teeth getting whiter, the plaques are slowly ""melting"" away, I can see their colour as I clean. The feel of cleaning my teeth is as if I'm at the destinst getting my teeth professionally done. I recommend 10 min daily, play a YouTube video as you're cleaning as s good way of timing yourself.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush. Comes with a handy travel case which is awesome and easily washed. The pressure sensor is great. Never realized I was pushing too hard!The little screen it comes with it ok. It counts down a 2 minute timer and shows you what part of your mouth to brush. But once it ran out of batteries we never replaced them and haven't missed it.I never did setup bluetooth on it... Probably should.Overall a decent toothbrush, but definitely on the expensive side.

Came quickly and packaged well.  The case is a little awkward not really a good fit for the brush.  the brush itself is amazing. I love the different modes and the app.  I would recommend this product.  My hygienist recommended this brush, I can’t wait for my next check up !!
"
"
This was a replacement for another, roughly 15 year old, Oral electric brush, that was still working fine mechanically, but some plastic was cracking around the drive shaft area, causing the brush to wiggle. For what it's worth, the batteries in the old brush were still good, with no signs of ""memory effect"", which in any case is a near myth.This brush is definitely better than my old brush, and yes, after brushing my teeth feel like I've just seen my dental hygienist. It's a couple of months until I see her, and get her opinion! My old brush only had a 2-minute timer, and this one's every 3- seconds timer does make me more aware of giving equal attention to all quadrants of my mouth. The added wireless display is ok, but in my opinion more of a gimmick than a real tool. Plus, in order to see it while brushing, it has to be mounted at eye-level near behind your sink, and that makes it near enough that with my poor eyesight I have to be wearing glasses while brushing, splashing toothpaste on them. So it is more a digital clock for my bathroom than an actual improvement on tooth-brushing.One criticism; the packaging could be a lot simpler, and less wasteful. Most of the content is air.

I have been using the oral B 7000 for about a month and I have to say I couldn't be more happy with the results. The different brush heads allow you to be your own little at home dentist and really hit all the problem areas. The gum massager is amazing and my teeth are noticeably whiter since using this brush.The timer helps give you great feed back on how you are doing while brushing and ensuring you are giving your teeth the proper time. I have never felt so strongly about a tooth brush, but this is one that every one must own. Our dental health should always be a top concern and this brush really does address every issue. It is well worth the money and will out perform any other toothbrush I guarantee you that.
"
"
We got this one to replace an older model that had the same Bluetooth time counter but it’s more expensive now. We could have paid less for the one that only uses the app but we don’t want to be data-mined as the privacy policy states would happen. I despise their business practices, but their toothbrush does a good job and lasts 4-5 years with 4 uses per day.

Good well made electric tooth brush, operates as described.Not sure of the pricing but since I purchased it from Amazon, it was $80 cheaper than buying itin a retail store here in Canada. I would also consider the Oral-B 5000 or even the Oral-B 4000,they have pretty much the same mechanics including battery life but less modes and cheaper travel cases.I would consider Amazon's price excellent from that perspective.Being that this is my third purchase of Oral-B electric tooth brushes, I can honestly saythat at the price quoted by Amazon is proportionately fair given the upgraded components.The reason why the 7000 costs more is because of such things as the quality travel case that is somuch better than the 5000  .... etc.Points I'm very happy with the 7000 .... 1 Great price compared to retail stores 2 Delivered to my door in two days 3 Great product 4 The wireless Smart Guide can be useful for timing your brushing  or it can be used as a clock alone for the bathroom 5 Quality travel case for both the handle and the chargerI would also like to say even though it is great electric brush my previous Oral-B brush had awall mountable charger which was great for not taking up space on the bathroom counter.Some other reviews of this brush noticed that as well.I don't know why that design was stopped but it was much appreciated by many purchasers of the Oral-B line.
"
"
First off, how important is your smile? Second, how often do you brush your teeth? Spending money on a tool that you should be using at least twice a day, for a physical attribute that typically defines you, seems like a worth while investment The Oral-B 7000 is worth it. I've come to realize that I've been brushing my teeth wrong up until this purchase. This tooth brush tells you whether you are brushing too hard and ensures you are brushing your teeth long enough. It does not get more convenient than that. I read all the reviews for multiple brushes prior to this purchase and with the exorbitant amount of positive reviews on the Oral-B, I had to give it a shot. I can genuinely say my teeth feel cleaner than they ever did. It feels like I just got cleaning done at the dentist every time I finish brushing my teeth now. It is a sturdy built brush versus some of the other competitors. Its longevity is to be seen but it feels and runs immaculately. It comes with a timer/clock that you attach to your mirror; if you share a bathroom this could be inconvenient but you do not have to mount it. It has an app that gives you feed back and a history of your brushing habits via bluetooth - some say overkill but I always enjoy seeing the data. I read reviews regarding the placement of the buttons being inopportune but I have had no issues. It comes with a chic travelling case as an added benefit. The brush itself is aesthetically pleasing and in the very least gives you some style points.(Oral-B needs some all black brush heads to complete the all black look) Performance, build, and look are all A+. Purchase this brush my friend, you can thank me afterwards.
"
"
Item is perfect.  Works like a charm. Minute module is giving you a nice follow-up of your brushing stage and bluetooth was a charm to synchronizeI tried the Phillips Sonicare and I much prefer this 7000.  I was not sure between the 8000 model and the 7000 model but I think I made the right choice in choosing the 7000 series with the  Smart Guide combine with the bluetooth app.
"
"
Our Oral B Triumph Professional Care Rechargeable stopped charging when placed back on the charging post unless you turned it around to force it to better connect.  So we looked for a replacement.  The reviews on the 7000 were very good and it appeared to have everything we had with the Triumph including one of my favorites - the Bluetooth Smartguide.  It will apparently hold a charge for much longer thus making it easier to take on vacation (although so far we have only taken it on a 3 day trip).  The hard cover travel case is nice and carries 2 brushes and the Power Brush (not the charging post however).  It has 7 different levels of brushing you can choose from.  After about 1 month of use, we are very happy with it.
"
"
The toothbrush works ok, however like the older models the performance is less than stellar unless you leave it constantly on the charger - which is bad for the battery. Oral-B should have long ago moved to a newer battery technology such as lithum ion or similar to address this problem. As a result, the toothbrush now works great when fully charged, but noticely slows down and performs not nearly as well once you've used it one or two times. This leaves your mouth feeling ""less clean"". For the price it should have a much better battery and I would not buy it again.
"
"
It does an amazing job of brushing your teeth. Your mouth has that “I just left the dentist "" feel. I like the timer it comes with. Plus the brushing options are very handy. I bought it on sale but I would gladly pay the actual price for it.

Excellente brosse a dent. J'utilise une brosse électrique depuis plus de 20 ans et j'ai d'excellente dents. Le seule point faible de cette brosse, est quelle est bruyante et j'aime pas les 'bip bip"" a chaque 30 sec. pour vous avisez de changer de côté. Je vais possiblement essayer la Philips la prochaine fois car elle a aussi de bons commentaires. Excellent brush tooth. I use an electric brush for over 20 years and have excellent teeth. The only weak point of this brush is what is noisy and I do not like the ""beep beep"" at every 30 sec. To notify you to change sides. I will possibly try Philips next time because it was also good comments.
"
"
Good toothbrush, works like is supposed to.  Battery life isn't that great but if you leave it in the cheaper than it is fine.  Charging takes a while but if you leave it over night it will be fine.  It comes with case, extra heads,  pouch, charger, holder for heads,  timer, and the brush.  This brush is great, much better than a manual toothbrush. The Bluetooth works fine just press one button and all the information goes to your phone. On the phone it gives alot of details.  I like how we can customize which mode comes next. I just wish it was cheaper.
"
"
Oral-B 7000 arrived well packaged. The unit is sleek in design and includes a separate timer. The timer is convenient and helpful to ensure you brush your mouth for a minimum prescribed two minutes. Staring directly at the timer isn't required because the unit will automatically change speeds once you've achieved two minutes. But a nice feature to have. Also included are easy to follow instructions, plus three starter brushing heads. If inclined, this unit is also Bluetooth compatible so you can track your dental hygiene regime. Love this unit. Pricey yes, but an excellent investment and well worth the cost. Your teeth feel super clean after each brushing.
"
"
This toothbrush is truly amazing. I find the app to be slightly laggy, however all-in-all, I am ecstatic as to how well this tooth brush works, especially the way it is constantly reminding me to floss (via the app), how it allows me to add my dentist appointments so it reminds me about them to the app, and also how I have it remind me to pay extra attention to trouble spots after my last cleaning at the dentist.If it weren't for the app being a bit laggy, I'd rate this product 5 stars.All-in-all though, I'd definitely buy it again.
"
"
This is one of the best buys for me in 2019. It's like discovering a car when you're used to a horse-carriage. I used to use a normal toothbrush and now I will never go back to using a normal one.The modes are great, I love the deep clean and tongue cleaner modes also the app is neat and simple to use.If you're thinking of upgrading this is not a bad place to begin. 5 stars
"
"
This is a fantastic toothbrush. As a new mom, brushing my teeth became a very rushed chore! Haha. Honestly this toothbrush has saved my gums because I was brushing too hard all the time. It has a sensor to tell you if you're brushing too hard. I wish I purchased sooner! Try to snag one on sale because it is so expensive. I also had an Amazon gift certificate. :) Enjoy!!
"
"
Bought this on PRIME day at about 35% off. Well worth the price I paid. Wished they had shipped it with more than 3 brush heads. Product works as advertised and no complaints. Got the family brushing more too!
"
"
Yes it's a pricy brush but it's worth it, especially if you have somewhat bad brushing habits, as I do. The reminders for when to change brush heads are very appreciated. I love the customized brushing and couldn't ask for more. Very cute travel case and bag that come with it too.

Pro:1. Fast twisting brush head has been proven to be the only effective cleaning brush.  With the tips showing on the LCD further helps improving its performance. 2. The 6 degree slanting makes the brush stronger when the consumer is taught to keep the brushes always ""kissing"" distance from the surface.  3.The quality other than the charger is 5 star grade.Con: 1. The length of the body can be shorter regardless the physical build of the consumer.  This brush is supposed to be a gift to my daughter and she hesitated to accept all because of its tallness. It is taller than the 2 Pxxxxxxxxx brands.  2. The consolidated cage for the brushes and the charger need a better design.  One brush will be shared by adult members of the family.  The brush heads after use are wet and should be kept standing so that they will become dry within minimal time.  Less chance for bacteria to find home there.  3. Should be more generous with the inexpensive color coding plastic rings.  Provide the set of 4 colors to even 3 pcs replacement set for identity.  4. The charger is not globally friendly.  It accepts only 110 and may be 120v.  This device is so luxuriously priced that leads to the assumption that consumers use it in 5 or 6 star hotels that provides dual voltage in their washrooms as standard.  Otherwise get oneself a voltage converter handy when travelling to 220 - 240v countries.  The designer mush bear in mind appreciating consumers will not fall back to hand held plastic brushes for any reason.  5. If the battery is not lithium, please have it updated as well.

Good electric toothbrush, cleans my teeth better than my old Braun one because the vibration is faster. Hope it lasts 13+ years like the old Braun. The timer divides the 2 minute brushing into 4 parts which is convenient and effective. The phone app is a bit infantile but I guess young kids would like it and adding incentive to brushing their teeth is more important than my already a habit brushing of my old teeth.
"

This is the second one I purchased, first one was for my husband and I was so jealous of how good it was I wanted one too. I purchased his a year ago so I can honestly say it has passed the test of time. I didn't think it would make much of a difference from my 5 year Oral B brush but I when I finish brushing it feels the same as when you have had your teeth cleaned at the dentist office.
"
"
Looks great, comes with a high quality travel case, has every brushing setting you could need. Bluetooth is a gimmick, but the clock/timer it's connected to is awesome! The battery last for around a week which is great, but it takes a long time to charge... Also the blue light is crazy bright.I feel like the price is a bit steep for what it is though... In comparison to the cheaper models it doesn't really make sense to pay this much for a toothbrush. If it goes on sale, it's a solid option.

Ça nettoie en profondeur comme si on allait chez le dentiste à chaque jour. Il y a moins de dépôt de tartre. La durée de la charge de la batterie dure environ 8 à 9 jours pour 3 brossages par jour de 2 minutes.It deep cleans like going to the dentist every day. There is less tartar deposit. The duration of the charge of the battery lasts approximately 8 to 9 days for 3 brushings per day of 2 minutes.
"
"
I've got really​ clean teeth with this amazing toothbrush. Removes plaque does an amazing job! definitely get your money's worth with it.
"
"
Just got the package on Wednesday (shipped out on Monday).  So far, it is everything as described and one of the best prices I have seen anywhere (retail or online).  I have been a fan of Oral B electronic toothbrushes for many many years and I figure to upgrade to the top of the line.  I do not expect Oral B to fail me and very grateful the deals and services Amazon.ca can provide me.
"
"
The Wi-Fi connectivity is really redundant.  If you track your brushing stats on your smart phone past the first 3 weeks of owning this brush, you need a hug, and some friends.  Beyond that, it's still just a (good) electric toothbrush.
"
"
I’ve had this product since 2016 and I’m extremely satisfied. The cleaning action is amazing, and my teeth look like they’ve gotten a professional cleaning every time I brush.I’ve been quite negligent lately when it comes to dental hygiene; I’ve gone weeks without brushing; this device has allowed my teeth to heal and become healthy again.
"
"
I'ts way more than anybody needs in a tooth brush. I got it for the sale price so why not get the flagship right? I dont use the bluetooth at all, i could see it being helpfull for children learning to brush properly but its more than ill ever need. It comes with extra brush heads but no dual actions :( they are about $25 for 3 and are a far superior brush head. At the end of the day its  an electric toothbrush, does whats it's suppose to do. Definatly an upgrade from my manual brush and it comes with a sweet travel case, like the one Dexter has for his tranquilizer seringe! :D
"
"
Awesome for travelling, went away for a week with 2 out of 3 battery and lasted the whole week. Boyfriend had the black one but I like the white so it doesn't show much slop and spit on it after brushing lol
"
"
Great toothbrush, too bad I can't just leave it there. Way too much fancy packaging, carrier bags, etc. You throw away more than you keep. Ridiculous in this day and age that companies still need to go overkill on the packaging. I hardly think that all that extra fluff sells more toothbrushes.
"
"
My teeth feel clean, the tooth brush work just fine. The app is glitchy so I just gave up on it. Probably would opt for a cheaper model without Bluetooth connection if I were to buy again
"
"
I started to notice my teeth required extra flossing after using this brush. It does not clean between the teeth at all. And because the brush head is small, toothpaste gathers in between the bristles giving the brush head a dirty look 🤢. Had to soak the heads in baking soda/water long before they required replacing. Don’t recommend this product.
"
"
Honestly. Reviewing a toothbrush..... but wow this thing is amazing. Cant go wrong. Will do a week of brushing without seeing another charge. So excellent for short trips somewhere
"
"
The product is very gimmicky and didn't provide any extra value. I have a pretty decent phone, but the app still felt clunky. Just get a normal electric toothbrush, you'll be better off. There's some cool ones which kill bacteria with UV rays. Its a decent toothbrush but definitely not worth the money.
"
"
It’s ergonomic, beautiful design, settings are all nice, cleans teeth perfectly!Large and heavy to travel with.Battery doesn’t last for long, as the battery is draining the strength of the brushing decreases. Always keep fully charged for best cleaning!
"
"
Don't really use the Bluetooth but the brush and settings are great. Travel case is awesome as well. Probably find a cheaper brush that would do the same things.
"
"
It does a fantastic job of cleaning my teeth; they feel like I've just been to the dentist.  I like the separate timer.  It's a great improvement over having a timer on the handle where you couldn't see it.  The timer also picks up where it left off if you pause and restart while brushing.  One complaint: the blue LED that indicates charging is extremely bright.  We found it too bright even with our bathroom door closed.  There's enough light to be annoying even through the cracks around the door, especially because it flashes off and on.  We now leave it off the charger at night and only charge during the day, which is a simple enough solution to not deduct a star.
"
"
I like the overall of the product, the battery is good, the travel set, the timer in the mirror. But so  Disappointed with the Bluetooth because the Apps need to be open to register all information from the toothbrush’s. I don’t always bring my phone in the bathroom especially when I take shower then brush my teeth.
"
"
This is my first time purchasing a Oral-B toothbrush and I like the way it operates. First time charge can take up to 24 hrs. I've had this for about 2 weeks now and I like the job its doing.
"
"
I bought it to replace my sonic toothbrush that broke after a few years of use and am very pleased.  This toothbrush in my opinion does a much better job at brushing than my old one.  The only thing I really don't care about is the Bluetooth.  I wish I could have bought the same model without Bluetooth connectivity.
"
"
Seems to clean well, the brush modes and timer should be more correlated... unsure of the battery as I haven't let it drain and leave it on the charger after every brush.
"
"
Nothing but good things to say, both the charger and toothbrush have lasted over a year with no issues, the carrying case is perfect and the replacement brushes are sold in every retailer.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Always been a fan on the Oral-B toothbrushes. Owned the Triumph series previously.This seems to be a revamped version of it, with some minor updates.Generally expensive, but i got it on sale.But i am happy with it because of my satisfaction with the Triumph series. I can definitely appreciate the difference as compared to a manual toothbrush. It's difficult for me to compare to other electric toothbrushes as i have never owned any other brand
"
"
The produce meets expectation. The timer requires batteries that must be replaced often. It comes with 2 extra heads, one with soft bristles. Travel case feels like it is well made, good for traveling. If you purchase white, prepare to get the case dirty. Battery charge on the toothbrush lasts about 5 days, takes 48 hours to have a complete charge.Liquid will seep through brush head and touch the metal prong that vibrates the bristles.Overall -  purchased on recommendation of dentist since my teeth are unnaturally prone to stains. For 200, it is a good investment if you have the money for it.Recommend by dental hygienist to use Colgate optic white toothpaste and mouth rinse with it.
"
"
Fine toothbrush.  Have used them for years and this model does not disappoint.  Designed and manufactured in Germany!!!  Do not see many products built outside China these days, despite Chinese citizen's deaths due to pollution.That being said, I replaced my last one (a model 4000) because the battery gave erratic service after about three (3) years of use.  I am not complaining, although it would be advantageous to be able to purchase just the battery pack.  Alas, it not available.Lastly, Bluetooth.  It will not work unless your device is fitted with Bluetooth 4.  If this is not the case, you will not be able to 'pair' the toothbrush.
"
"
I just bought the tooth brush and on the first day of arriving the tooth brush won’t even charge it’s been almost 3 days and I’ve done everything to try to get it to charge but I got nothing don’t buy this product until amazon gets this issue fixed. Unless you want to have a $168 gone from you account.
"
"
Something went wrong with the charger within a year. But due to a family tradgey I missed the year warranty and got  the run around by Oral B.I had a model from eight years ago which is why I bought this one, and the price was excellent.
"
"
I love the toothbrush as better than my old oral-b one. The only downside at the moment sinceI just bought it August 12/17 is the Bluetooth technology. So far the app refuses to recognizeMy toothbrush. Hopefully Oral- b can resolve my issue as working on it. The main reasonI purchased this technology.
"
"
Find it a bit loud but this is also my first electric toothbrush... The timer on it makes brushing easier and almost a challenge to keep my teeth cleaner than with a manual. For the first time in my life, I actually look forward to brushing my teeth.
"
"
Toothbrush defintely gives you the 'Dentist Treatment'. In addition the timer and toothbrush are in sync for 30sec intervals. Battery lasts long, and I brush past the 2mins (daily). App could use more work but overall great quality for a month, hopefully it sustains the effectiveness for a few years.
"
"
Never seem my wife so happy to receive this tooth brush after her 1000 stopped working. She just loves it and I'm a hero for getting it for her as a gift.
"
"
THE SMARTGUIDE IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. MY OLD ORAL B (WITH SMART GUIDE) WORKS WITH THE NEW ONE TOO.
"
"
I am in love with this electric toothbrush!It cleans very well!I never had an electric toothbrush! I do not know about others products in the market, but this one I do recommend!
"
"
Bought this as a birthday gift for my mother. She thinks it's great. She didn't really want Bluetooth (she doesn't own a smart phone) but the sale price made it even less expensive than the lesser models. I really don't see the point of having Bluetooth in a toothbrush anyway. People want an effective electric toothbrush not a monthly report on how much they brush! Quite silly really.
"
"
Something wrong with this. It has a red indicator light if you push ""too hard"" on your teeth and slows down the motor. When I put my Oral B brush head on the handheld it goes red and slows the motor down everytime I brush. I don't understand.... Such a waste of money.
"
"
OK.  Inclus des bébelles non nécessaires.exemple: l'affichage bluetooth ne dit pas si on se brosse les dents une fois par jour ou une fois par mois..  L'affichage pourrait dire l'heure et la date du brossage.  L'étuit de voyage ???.  Je m'en servirai pour ma brossse de voyage.
"
"
Lots of stuff comes with this toothbrush!  It’s easy to use and does a great job.  I have limited space around my sink so unfortunately there’s not a lot of space for the brush head and toothbrush holder but I have adapted!
"
"
The protective cover for the timer is the wrong way round. And if i clip it on, it blocks the time behind it making it useless.
"
"
The toothbrush itself is fantastic. Having a pressure sensor and timer really keeps a person honest.The app is pretty flakey, like 2 star flakey. But since you don't need the app to run the brush I give it 5 stars.
"
"
You can’t go wrong with this product it’s so convenient and my last oral b lasted 8yrs!
"
"
I have used a few of the Oral B tooth brushes over the past few years. This one is the best one by far. I got it on sale last year right around Black Friday, so if they do the same this year it is well worth the money.
"
"
I purchased this a few weeks ago, I like it but honestly it's not worth spending so much ($180+) for a toothbrush. If I had to purchase an electric toothbrush again, I'd buy one with the same features except the fact that it's connected (pretty useless) for ~$80.
"
"
The overall quality of this toothbrush is excellent and the happy face visual timer is a great tool especially from my young son. It helps him do a full brush in all areas of his mouth. I have not used the Bluetooth app but will be doing that soon to help him track his brushing daily.
"
"
Haven’t used the Bluetooth feature extensively, but as a toothbrush this thing is amazing.
"
"
Je l'aie depuis quelques semaines et je ne pourrais plus m'en passer.
"
"
The product comes complete with everything you need to get started. Cleaning performance, when fully charged, is excellent. However, mine starts losing power after six minutes of use; two sessions of three minutes with two minutes using normal and one minute of polishing setting. Recharging the unit takes between 12 and 24 hours. This is disappointing given its price.
"
"
I'm never going back to using a manual toothbrush! This is simply beautiful, I've never felt a fresher mouth, not to mention it syncs with your phone, pushing you towards your goal (you can set a whitening goal through the app and you follow the planned brushing for 2 weeks and.. boom! Whitest smile ever!)
"
"
I bought this product so that I could track my brushing habits thinking that I could not do that with the same unit as my spouse. The problem is that the smart guide does not recognize mine as a different unit and picks up my spouse’s brush time.
"
"
Works wonders. So many settings and so accurate. I use to brush my teeth for 5 minutes thinking that it was good. Then I found out I was over brushing and this toothbrush helped fixed that with its timer.
"
"
Exceptional quality. Easy to set up and start using. Good power and good battery strength.
"
"
Looks good, well made but not sure a person really needs all the bells and whistles for the price
"
"
I've been using this toothbrush for about 2 or 3 years now. Works great, the app was a bit buggy, but not necessary as the toothbrush will vibrate when you need to switch quadrants.
"
"
Amazing product, has so much extra thing I done use but I like to have them incase I do wsnt to use them, awesome for ppl with sensitive gums
"
"
This is simply the best toothbrush I've ever owned. The carrying case make it great for short trips, and the selection of brush heads and brush modes make this an all around amazing way to maintain or improve your oral health.
"
"
Product seems very well designed and reasonably priced.Works well and has many well thought out features adding to its high level of quality.
"
"
I bought Oral B 7000 because I was damaging my gums from brushing to hard, this has a sensor that shows when I brush to hard. The most important part is how my teeth feel so clean like just like being cleaned by the dentist.
"
"
A++ Work as expected. Still holding after 1 year and 7 month of heavy use (family of 4). LCD segments are starting to fade on SmartGuide but still readable.
"
"
Really disappointed, received this product with items missing and electric toothbrush not charging/ working.
"
"
Works great I particularly like the timing function. Brushes clean very well and when completed I feel my teeth and mouth are very clean. I would strongly recommend this product.
"
"
The Oral 7000 is a very good brush in that it's easy to use. Charge it, ensure the timer has batteries, push power button and the timer starts counting seconds. The brush starts on high frequency and after every 30 seconds the frequency moves down one level. The fact that I see the timer intuitively makes me brush longer as long as I'm not in a hurry. One thing I really like is if I brush too hard as in pressing too hard, a red light goes on to warn you.
"
"
Mon garçon aimes bien la Bross à dents.Il l'utilise 2 fois par jours.
"
"
Works great but full retail pricing is a bit steep for what you are getting.  I managed to purchase on Black Friday for a significant price reduction over regular retail pricing.
"
"
Cette brosse a dents fonctionne sans failles, sa recharge est plutôt longue => 6 heures. Je la conseille car elle à remplacé 2 brosses a dents d'un modèle inférieure de la même compagnie.
"
"
This item came repack. all the content seem to be new but the packaging was not the best. Maybe I caught a returned product that hasn't been used.
"
"
The battery is not lasting as long as it’s predicted to according to the manual .  Might get five or six days at 2×2 minute brushings a day – but there could’ve been some damage/freezing in transit. Not sure
"
"
Really enjoy this app based toothbrush.  My teeth feel like I was at the dentist getting a cleaning after it was done .  Definitely recommend to anyone who has teeth problems!
"
"
Love these toothbrushes! Highly recommended!
"
"
Excellent product - Far better than the last Gen of this model -works without using the app perfectly, not needed as I do not want my I phone in the Bathroom just asking for trouble.
"
"
I use it for almost about one month, everything is well, not find any problem. I have not make it clear that the how to use the discount card wich is bing at the same product mailbox, and why not have a chinese language booklet?
"
"
Great toothbrush but they should tell you how the smart guide clock works. They're two tiny buttons inside the clock where the batteries are to set the time. I prefer the actual app. Love that but my husband likes the smart guide.
"
"
I loved my new toothbrush very easy to use and it does its job very well, it reaches places where basic toothbrushes do not reach. I would buy it without hesitation
"
"
Great toothbrush. I had an earlier model from about 7 years ago that no longer lasted more than a day or two. This one lasts and provides a truly refreshing mouthfeel every day. Your mouth will feel as fresh as your last visit to the dentist.
"
"
Fancy carrying case, great quality, as expected from Oral B. Mounted the clock/timer in the shower which is really handy.
"
"
Lots of power in this model. Smart phone setup is easy but if you miss syncing with your phone the app thinks you didn't brush your teeth when in fact you did.
"
"
just over three months old and it stopped working. will not charge, just blinks on the charger.
"
"
love this toothbrush. works well. makes my mouth feel like I've just been at the dentist. charging time is a quite long, hence the 4 stars, not 5.
"
"
I am very happy with this purchase.  I noticed a huge improvement over my old electric toothbrush immediately.  Teeth feel much cleaner and it seems to last longer.Pricey but I found it on sale so it wasn't as bad.
"
"
Après moins d un an la pile tient moins sa charge
"
"
The toothbrush is good, the software is not that great. The cool thing is that it has an sdk and you can write your own apps, looking forward to play around with that.
"
"
Cleans really well, easy to use, can’t believe I haven’t been brushing with this all my life. Love it!
"
"
Super bonne brosse à dent, je ne retournerais plus jamais à une brosse ordinaire, les effets sont immédiats et impressionnants ! J'adore, j'ai l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste chaque fois que je me brosse les dents :D
"
"
High tech tooth care, great !!
"
"
Arrived as described!
"
"
Excellent machine totally satisfied, should have purchased one years ago, way easier and better than a manual tooth brush, however, ensure you look for sale pricing.
"
"
excellent produit. j'aime beaucoup.
"
"
Works as described
"
"
Awesome toothbrush works great use it every day
"
"
Great product. as described. and good quality. would buy again.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
Love it!!! Great product for the whole family!!
"
"
Great product cleans well
"
"
Works great, exactly how I thought. Happy with the purchase.
"
"
Great toothbrush. Would never go back to a manual. Love the look and feel of it, and it leaves your teeth feeling dentist clean.The travel case is a great feature too. Very sturdy. Wish it incorporated the charger however.
"
"
Works great and does the job. Powerful.
"
"
I bought this rechargeable toothbrush in November 2015. It is now early September 2016 and the charger no longer works! It has only been 9 months.  WTF.  I deserve to have a working charger and I expect better from Oral B.  I gave it a generous 2 stars.
"
"
So far so good.
"
"
I don’t like the battery, it’s only last for one week. But everything else are good. The power and the features are good.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush but the bluetooth light stays on all the time (flashing on & off)It might be disturbing if your bathroom is connected to your bedroom.Braun needs to fix this blinking light issue
"
"
Received great customer service with this product.The features are great and you can feel the difference using this toothbrush compared to a normal manual toothbrush.
"
"
Love it. Highly recommend.
"
"
This toothbrush is an excellent product and well worth the cost. It replaces the Oral-B Braun toothbrush that lasted almost twenty years. Travels well too.
"
"
I’ve used this for 3 months. It’s a bit expensive but it does a great job.
"
"
Was a gift for my husband. He loves it. Has been using it for over 2 years and super happy about it
"
"
This is a excellent toothbrush.  Couldn't get anything better for the price that's forsure.
"
"
The tooth brush is working very well until The battery died after  6 months.  Impossible to get in touch with amazon.ca which was the seller to replace it.
"
"
Pas encore utiliserMa 5000 fonctionne encore
"
"
We love our electric toothbrush!!! It travels well and the battery life is long!!
"
"
I feel like my teeth are super clean every time I use it.
"
"
Ive been using Oral-B for years but this clean feels just like i got back from the dentist. So if you're reading this you can, or almost afford the extra cost of the 7000. You won't be disappointed. Oral-B  even has a money back guarantee. Enjoy
"
"
Affordable
"
"
I love this! I've been using it for the last few months and can't imagine going back to a regular toothbrush. Feels like I've been at the dentist every time I brush :) fast delivery. thank you
"
"
Love the feel of my teeth after cleaning
"
"
Ma premiere bross electick... Tres efficace, je fais beaucoup beaucoup b... de tartre et depuis la brosse 90 % moins..  Je ne sais pas si moins cher serai aussi bon??? Je n'ai jamais eu d'autre pour comparer..je vous recommande celle là.
"
"
Fontionne bien.Réponds à mes attentes
"
"
Quick delivery, a good product and a great deal.  Fancy for a toothbrush but love it so far.
"
"
WoW génial! Vraiment moins cher qu’ailleur et va vraiment bien!
"
"
le bluetooth est un peu gadget avec l'application pour mobile... mais autrement entièrement satisfait du produit
"
"
Just like going to the Dentists!  I now spend on average from 3 to 5 minutes brushing.  Fabulous product. Wish I had purchased years ago.
"
"
Works great
"
"
Quick delivery without any problems. After trying a few electric toothbrushes before, this one is the best to keep my teeth almost as clean as after a visit to the dentist. Excellent quality and functionality.
"
"
I feel like I've come from the dentist on a daily basis
"
"
I'm an Oral B fan anyway but love my new Oral B Precision Black 7000 electric toothbrush.  My teeth have never felt cleaner and are certainly whiter.  My only complaint is that the brushes that were included with the toothbrush are not labelled so it's been trial and error as to which brush I should use for which purpose. .  I would highly recommend this toothbrush.
"
"
Teeth feel so clean.
"
"
Hands down. Best toothbrush ever. powerful.good battery life. definitely makes you feel like you got your moneyS worth of a brush. only downfall as mentioned before is it takes a good 24 hours for a full charge...if you need a quick brush before.u go throw.it on for 20 mins for a quick clean
"
"
This is the natural evolution of teeth cleaning, There are a variety of modes to choose from and the Charge last forever and ever.
"
"
Charges quickly, works well, very powerful.The rotating head is especially great for cleaning around permanent ortho wires :)
"
"
Product arrived as expected. Have been using it since and quite satisfactory results. Price OK as I later found out London Drugs is selling at similar price. Could have got it at London Drugs without waiting for shipping.
"
"
Battery doesn't last one month, takes over 8hrs to charge and only lasts 1 week. Makes horrible noises when brushing
"
"
Nothing to complain about except receiving an outdated coupon for 3$ off dates 07/31/2018.  Great product!
"
"
Very good product
"
"
kid loves it, brushes forever
"
"
The toothbrush is well-designed with pressure control, so that you won’t press it so hard to your teeth. Feel great when using it!
"
"
Love this. Never realized how great this was over a manual brush
"
"
Excellent brush
"
"
Sure makes your teeth whiter
"
"
like a lot.
"
"
Love our toothbrush. I thought my teeth were clean until I tried this! Now they are clean! Wife and I both love it.
"
"
Have only used it for a short while but it was a great buy.  Very pleased with it so far.
"
"
Great brush, works really well.
"
"
Tel que décrit !
"
"
What a powerful tool for me ! Cleaning become very easy !! I strongly recommand !
"
"
Within the 1st day, both my fiance and myself had smoother and noticeably whiter teethby following the customizable teeth cleaning plan provided by oral b free app.
"
"
I had doubts about expensive ones but got it on sale.it is leagues above the 30 dollar version.Bluetooth was unnecessary though, I don't ever use it.
"
"
Girlfriend enjoy it
"
"
It's expensive but works as advertised.
"
"
The best toothbrush .
"
"
great brush but has waaaay more options than we'll ever use. i would probably just buy the cheaper version if i were to do it again.
"
"
A little overpriced but it is a great toothbrush. If you don't need the Bluetooth and the travel case I recommend getting a cheaper version.
"
"
Very happy with its performance. Just what I would expect from Oral B. Battery life excellent. Just can't understand why I need Bluetooth compatibility.
"
"
I am really disappointed with this brush.  Although I really liked using it, after 5 months it just stopped charging.
"
"
Replaced my 8 year old Oral B toothbrush. Super happy with the improvement in technology. The pressure sensor is great
"
"
Nice toothbrush but the Bluetooth function is not evolved enough in my opinion. Still it's nice have a reminder every 30 sec to change side and to brush for at least 2min
"
"
Works greats
"
"
Amazing machine. My teeth feel as if I had just stepped out of the dentist office. I would recommend to anyone.
"
"
Love itLots of power.Best brush ive ever had

great product. Many features I have not even begun to explore, but various settings are fantastic
"
"
it is very useful product for everyone. delivery was very good . but the product is a little noisy that i didn't expect it.
"
"
Dentist recommended this.  Works very well.  It was bought to replace an older model that lasted 8 years.
"
"
An excellent device. I have been having difficulty with food particles getting stuck. I have a more conventional electric brush but it wasn't doing the job. This one does. I only wish the local store carried a better stock of replaceable heads.

Love this tooth brush! Half the price on Amazon than anywhere else and it's the perfect replacement for an old model which I've had for 7 years. The battery is only starting to not hold a charge now.
"

This toothbrush has lots of settings, works very well.  I love the wall monitor.  Highly recommended.

As good as expected, my husband likes it.
"
"
Amazing
"
"
I had the Philips diamond clean before the Precision 7000 and the Oral B cleans your teeth much better.
"
"
Great product at a discount price! Verified the authenticity with Oral B! Edges of the box were worn out but otherwise everything fine.
"
"
Quieter than the previous version.
"
"
Good quality, powerful, stylish, well worth the $$. No complaints so far.
"
"
Totally lives up to my expectations and more.  The remote timer and pressure sensor are great features.  The timer is a little diffilcult to set up and the pressure sensor could be more sensitive but these are minor setbacks in a great product
"
"
PRODUCT WAS SENT OPENED - PLASTIC WRAP WAS ABSENT SO IT WAS NOT USABLE. THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE THIS ORAL HYGIENE PRODUCT HAD NOT BEEN TAMPERED WITH OR USED.
"
"
Good Tooth brush
"
"
feeling better clean mouth as compared to before but after sometime I found my sensor thing is getting corrosion on it.so I m not happy with the hat at all.
"
"
My wife and I love the brush. Still no cavities.
"
"
I have only used for a few days and so far, it is great.  I could not warrant full marks yet as longevity and the battery effectiveness has not yet had time to prove itself.
"
"
Very powerful and keeps a charge for about a week
"
"
Works great. My teeth feel a lot cleaner after using it for the last two weeks.
"
"
Battery is not working. Does not hold a charge and sometimes will not charge at all.
"
"
Conforme aux attentes, très bien.
"
"
Quick to charge, easy to use, good instructions, definitely worth the money
"
"
tres satisfait
"
"
The box it came in was ripped!! It was a Christmas gift, other than that we'll find out when she gets to use it I guess !!!
"
"
The combination of the timer and the pressure sensor changed the way I brush.  Props both from me and my dental hygienist.
"
"
modes are not quite useful except regular, a bit too expensive, otherwide all good
"
"
Up to Oral B's normal standards and the Bluetooth timer and brushing quality indicator is great.
"
"
I love my new toothbrush. It does everything it promised to do. I love the timer and the graphic that tells me if I have spent enough time in each area of my mouth. I highly recommend it to everyone. ​
"
"
Great great
"
"
Battery died after 1 month of use. Will not charge. Lame for 200 bucks. Returning this dollar store trash
"
"
This toothbrush is amazing how well it cleans your teeth and your teeth feel like you have just had a cleaning at the dentist's.  This toothbrush is expensive but it is definitely worth it and I would highly recommend you will not be disappointed with this purchase.
"
"
Very nice!
"
"
Very large and clunky, the vibration was so strong it made my brain rattle.
"
"
This is a very good product, I hope that it proves reliable in the long term, given Braun's reputation for poor quality, I do have some concerns.
"
"
Absolutely love this toothbrush. Would highly recommend.
"
"
Good
"
"
Shipping rapide, elle marche super bien ! Meme pour ma petite fille elle va super bien !
"
"
Great toothbrush. Removes majority of plaque from teeth, but usually end up going above the 2 min recommended time to remove it all.
"
"
the brush works well. too many unnecessary bells and whistles
"
"
Bonne brosse à dent électrique compatible avec plusieurs sortes de brosse .

One of the best I have ever used.
"

Feels like you've just come from the dentist. Love it.
"

This product is awesome

Found brush big, stalls easily, and dripping down the handle. Not a favourite.

Easy set up. Feels like heaven

Probably a defective
"

very nice product, very useful, great for everyone
"
"
Best toothbrush I've owned. A little over priced? Maybe, but I don't regret it.
"
"
Best toothbrush I have ever had.
"
"
Meets expectations but has limited features related to advanced guidance beyond keeping track of your basic oral health statistics.
"
"
Exactly as advertized
"
"
Perfect

Superbe brosse à dents électrique.Malheureusement, malgré ce qui est affiché sur le site, cette brosse à dents n'est pas compatible avec l'application Bluetooth. Très déçu.
"
"
J'ai jamais eut les dents si propre, j'aime beaucoup et je le recommande sans hésiter.
"
"
Runs well for several days (5-7, or more) on a full charge.  The monitor helps users to spend enough time brushing, to do an effective job.
"
"
Great toothbrush
"
"
i like an electric toothbrush.
"
"
Rien de négatif sur le produit
"
"
Does the job!
"
"
Very effective and the timer makes me do a better brushing.
"
"
Great product, my dental hygienist has noted the difference!
"
"
Exactement comme décrit.
"
"
Works great, battery life is pretty disappointing for a ""high-end"" model though. Takes roughly 24 hours to fully charge from dead each time.
"
"
Love it man, so good, have to buy it to understand what im talking about so good, it cleans so blessed, looooooove it....!!!!!!
"
"
I didn't even realize it when buying but this is the Fitbit of toothbrushes!
"
"
good
"
"
Works well
"
"
This is a great product. Handles perfectly, holds the charge as described. Works very well.
"
"
I love this thing! Makes me excited to brush my teeth everyday!
"
"
Very happy. Have been using it for the past 2 week and have noticed a that I am not developing as much plaque as I use to.
"
"
très bon produit a date  ,pas de problème a utiliser
"
"
it is great, but you are better to wait for big discounts.... sometimes it could be around $130
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned! My teeth feel ""dentist"" clean ever time I use it.
"

After the first time I've used it, it felt like I've just come out of the Dentist office after I had my teeth cleaned.  It brushes very well.

I have never felt the need or drive to write a review of a product before as I haven't truly had due cause to, but I made an exception with the Oral B Precision 7000. This item was delivered to me on May 19 and literally 2 months to the day, the battery stopped taking and holding a charge effectively rendering this ELECTRIC toothbrush utterly useless. I had read a few grumblings about battery issues when I was researching the toothbrush and now I'm sorry I didn't heed the warnings.If a consumer pays a premium price for what's marketed as a premium product, then quality should match expectations. Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this toothbrush. I followed the instructions where it stated to allow the battery to completely deplete at least once every month which is what got me here in the first place. I have had the toothbrush on its charging base for over 24 hours now and while the charging lights are running through their illumination cycle, once I turn it on, it runs for 3 seconds and the amber ""low battery"" light flashes.I had also noticed in the two months leading up to this point that the power/intensity of the toothbrush was noticeably weaker and dropped off after the first brush on a new charge. Considering they market it as having a 10 day battery, I'd say that's wholly misleading. The battery never lasted longer than 4 to 5 days.I can't in good conscience recommend this product. If you're torn between the Oral B and the Philips Sonicare, go with the Philips.I will be contacting Braun for a replacement, but their reputation has taken a hit in my eyes.

After using my first electric toothbrush for the past 2.5 months I'm ready to rate this at an average 3 stars... meaning a product with good potential and a one major shortcoming: the battery system. It's been said a few times already but you only get to understand after some use. Be prepared to recharge this more often then advertised.After 2.5 months I found that on average you get approx 7 days of 2 minutes, twice daily from full 3 blue bars charged to dead... but you need to know that the battery discharges rapidly from the said 3 blue bars to 2 blue bars then 1 blue bar then it changes the colour. I found that most of the operation is spent in the lower 1 bar and as it does so the speed and frequency of the moves / vibrations decreases... This is so noticeable that you may be inclined to re-charge it before discharging fully and thus reduce the number of battery cycles and product life span.One other note is about the wireless display which I plan to stop using. It links by radio waves with the toothbrush, brings up the happy face circle segments as you brush and gives you 5 full stars if you brush more then planned. It also uses battery power by itself and consumes toothbrush battery to do the radio communication when in use. Honestly I do not find much benefit from this display unless you need an extra time piece to stick to your bathroom wall. It may train you in brushing better if you haven't done it ever but... would trade it immediately for a better, higher capacity battery.

Came to this brush from a six year old Philips Flexcare. I wanted to buy a new Philips Sonicare brush but this was on sale for a great price due to Black Friday deal so I figured ""why not"" and purchased it. If you're coming from a manual brush, this would definitely be an improvement, but this is by far not top of the line.Things I noticed:- After switch from Philips to Oral-B, my teeth began losing their whiteness and plaque started to develop. No changes whatsoever in my brushing and flossing routine, the food I ate or the drinks I drank and even the water I brushed with stayed the same. Strike one.- The toothbrush is unnecessarily large. The carrying case was the size of my toiletry bag almost. The brush itself didn't fit comfortably in the hand.- You need to use the little display screen if you want to know what mode you're in. Because why would it make sense for them to put a display on the brush so you know what brushing mode you've selected?- Who the hell needs Bluetooth on their toothbrush, seriously.Furthermore, this brush (comparing MSRP) is more expensive than the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean, but there are numerous independent studies that rate the DiamondClean as being nearly twice as effective than the Oral-B Precision 7000 in a variety of criteria. If I recall correctly, the only category that the Oral-B brush won on was gum depth, which is something that can be affected by regular flossing.If you're going to drop bills on a new toothbrush, look away and check out Philips' products.(This may have got two stars instead of one if Oral-B's customer care didn't royally [edited] me off. One week with no email response, an hour and a half on hold [with the wrong number apparently, thanks to Oral-B's Twitter gurus] and an angry Tweet-conversation and they still didn't help me as much as Amazon did in <6 minutes)
"
"
I have been using this toothbrush for about 6 months now. I upgraded from a sonic care E. I have to say I am very pleased with this. It is very powerful and cleans your teeth very well. I also really like that it buzzes every 30 seconds so you know to switch what part of your mouth to brush even if you are not looking at the included display or a Bluetooth cellphone. Everything feels solid and very well made even the travel case.If I had to find a con I would say the LED charging light is to bright. If you brush your teeth right before bed your ensuite will glow bright blue.
"
"
Recieved package today. Smart Guide only displays half of information (top half of display works, bottom half dead). Do I need to return the whole package (rather not) or can the vendor send me another Smart Guide?
"
"
I bought this at just sub $200 because my last gen Oral B had rusted in the shaft.I bought it in June 2014 and by September 2014,the new one was rusting as well.Amazon was good enough to provide a new one in September(not P and G,the manufacturer)so,good on Amazon.The jury is still out as to whether the new toothbrush's so called stainless steel shaft will remain rust free or not. I consider the rusting of that shaft a health and safety issue.If it remains rust free,a fine power toothbrush and if it is durable say for 5 or more years without rusting or experiencing some other defect,could be a good thing.
"
"
Update: Recieved the replacement really quick, only 1 day wait. Received what is clearly a refurbished replacement.- garbage inside the box- toothbrush heads are all opened- time device has water stains on it- all equipment out of original packagingNot sure how Amazon deals with returns but that's exactly what i received.This is our second toothbrush. No issues with the first and we loved it which is why we decided to buy a second one. Only problem is the pressure sensor is always on even when there is no pressure applied.
"
"
Great toothbrush, but the Black 7000 is not pairing with the iPhone 5s  or even my wife's latest iPhone SE  using the Oral B app on bluetooth.  Beware.  Their customer support just suck.
"
"
Excellent tooth brush! Love it and yes it all the time I find I brush a lot more effective. Arrived on time and fast.
"
"
My first Oral-B toothbrush lasted just over 10 years and I really liked it, so this was a no-brainer for me. But THIS brush... good lord toothbrushes have changed. It not only syncs with the little display that you can put on the mirror to guide you through proper brushing, but it also syncs with a smartphone app that strokes my gadget addiction like crazy. There's too much to cover in a short review, just google it and read what all this thing can do. It definitely changes the way you care for your teeth.
"
"
The toothbrush has six different modes, bluetooth tracking device and blah, but it's all useless add-on features that you will never use.  Out of the six different modes, I only use one or two modes the most.  I don't use the tracking device at all because it takes time and effort to track something that I could careless about.  However, the toothbrush does the job and clean your mouth, but I would go with cheaper model in the future to save money.
"
"
I received the product on time however it was not posted in a mailing box, instead it was shipped in the Oral-B toothbrush box. The box was damaged and partial open.I opened the box and to my disappointment there was only 3 out of the 5 Oral B tooth brush heads.I placed the Oral-B toothbrush handle on the charging station for 12 hours and it wouldn't charge.
"
"
Doesn't work with my note 5 or samsung tablets.I'm still happy with it, comes with a screen to display the time so I don't need the app.Great for longterm use as the batteries are easily replaceable.  Will last me at least 10 years no doubt .
"
"
You never realize just how dirty your teeth are until you use a professional toothbrush. After purchasing this toothbrush the ""straight out of the dentist"" feel has become my norm. I can not go back to manual brushing after purchasing this.Highly, highly, highly, recommend this if you're oral health conscious.
"
"
Meets expectations. Love the selection of cleaning modes and timer.
"
"
I love it, so much easier to have a white smile with this brush... It really worth the price!
"
"
There's a white one and a black one. I thought the black one would be bigger but they're the same size.
"
"
VERY DISAPPOINTED! Got it as a Christmas gift, but the mood was ruined. Smartguide device is not working at all (some parts of symbols are on, some parts are off). Tried new sets of batteries several times, but it doesn't help. Pushing ""set"" or ""h/min"" button doesn't help either.Smartguide was the reason for buying this brush. I used to own Oral-B brushes for more than a decade, but I suppose it's time to switch to Philips.
"
"
Very disappointing, way too gimmicky and with very low battery life which is only 1 week. I bought this as an upgrade to my perfectly usable slim little Oral-B Pulsonic, that 3 years in, still has an impressive 6 week battery life. The only thing I like about this one is the standard round shape of the brush head.Don't waste your money; it's large, expensive, doesn't look near as great as you'd think and you really don't need all the timer variations it offers. I love Oral-B power toothbrushes but give this one a miss....it's like the windows8 of toothbrushes...you know the next version will be better so wait for that one.
"

very pleased

It does a great cleaning job. I like it

I am replacing a older Oral B with this newer model. I bought it despite reading about extremely long charging times and several complaints about the battery it uses.It has worked fine for the last month (other then taking a FULL 24 hours to charge) untill last week. I went to use it, dead. I charged it for a full day and used it before work. I got home that night, and before i went to bed went to use it. DEAD.  I'm pretty sure you shouldn't have to charge it for 24 hours to get a single use out of it. I'm going to try and get some resolution with Oral B about this issue, i'm assuming this is not by design. Maybe they can ship me just a battery and how to replace it, because the packaging was complicated and huge and i didn't save it for 2 months before it basically became useless.  I will update this review of anything is resolved.

Messy, the charging unit and bottom of of the brush  are covered with slime after three uses. The ridiculous gimics  like the ability to connect it to a cell phone to monitor your brushing practices  and to have a smiley face monitoring brushing while you brush is like having a helicopter mother hovering over you. I returned it and bought the Dutch equivalent.
"
"
i like it a lot
"
"
I love it ill never you a non-electric tooth brush again.  Although i think the 5000 is more than adequate, but i guess the travel case is kinda nice.
"
"
Received the oral-b 7000 package which im sure that was the returned or refurbished item. Toothbrush doesn't turn on, charger does not charge the toothbrush, package without 2 additional toothbrush heads, without the vinyl traval bag. Which were supposed to be included in the package, and stated including with the original retail box. Returned the next day and got refunded. If the unit is working and I used it, I wasnt even aware the package is missing the brush heads and the bag. Very bad experience.
"
"
it is very very made, just like a piece of art, but useless, actually i am a bit disapointed, not much better than a normal $2 one.

AMAZING toothbrush if you want healthy gum and great clean teeth purchase this product its so worth the money !!!
"

Absolutely love this toothbrush. It was easy to set up.Monitoring pressure and time of brushing provides very helpful feedback, to foster better tooth brushing habits. I've attached the monitor to the bathroom vanity mirror (where it doubles as a clock). The app was easy to install and use.The toothbrush itself is wonderful, giving a wonderful clean. I have ordered replacement heads f every available type. So far I've tried the whitening ones and they are GREAT! I can see and feel the difference of using this toothbrush (compared to my other cheap electric toothbrush) immediately on use. My teeth feel squeaky clean in between brushes and it makes the mundane task fun and educational.I never thought I would spend >$100 on a toothbrush...but I am so glad I did. I am never going back to my old toothbrushes after this!

First off - those who are complaining that the clear cover doesn't match the timer needs to understand that it's not supposed to. It's merely a back cover to hold the clip that affixes the times to a wall/mirror. The smiley on the clear cover is more than likely just an indicator to put two-and-two together.The deets:- Upon first charge (and as indicated by the instructions) took a full 24 hours for the charge light to stop blinking to indicate that it was fully charged and ready to go.- Switching between modes requires the sync between either the provided timer OR the downloadable app to flip through the modes and to see what mode you've chosen.- Unfortunately, it doesn't remember your setting for your next brushing which is a downfall, but not a deal breaker.- It's not dreadfully loud or have brain shaking vibrations, it's tolerable for me from never owning an electric toothbrush. Something to get used to.- The 3 brush heads that it comes with are great and feel good on the teeth.- The provided timer quickly syncs with the toothbrush once you turn it on and start brushing and does what it's described to doRead the dang instructions folks. I saw a lot of complains about things that are explained in the instructions. I know we all like to believe ourselves amazing and in no need of any instructions for anything ever! But do yourself this favour and read them!The hard case is very sturdy and better quality than I expected. It a smooth textured case that feels like you could drop it many times and everything will still be in tact and safe.The charger for the toothbrush is SO easy to use. And the added ""safe keeper"" (for lack of a better word at the moment) to hold your additional brush heads is very handy.  I can only assume that the little leatherette pouch it comes with would be to carry your charger and whatever else you may want to carry. It's a nice little touch.Perfect toothbrush ever at it's high price point. Try to get it on sale :)
"
"
The quickest summary for this item is:I spend less time brushing my teeth than before, and my teeth feel great!Notes:- pressure sensor is great for a chewer like me.- less time brushing my teeth overall- feel cleaner than before- I really like the app but the reviews are not great- Sale price is really good compared to other places- travel kit is nice for me where work takes me over night oftenI'm looking forward to my next dental visit to hear what they say.  I typically have inflammation in my top gums but the app had a program to help with that using the massage mode on the brush.
"
"
Picture of the stand above is different than the one you get, doesn't have a slot for the clock, also the plastic cover doesn't fit in place properly, falls off easily because the tabs were set on the wrong side. Also the plastic cover for the clock I got was molded incorrectly. Pretty disappointed, for the price I imagined it would be built much better.
"
"
Brush just has 3 modes, it should have 6 six modes. The guide didn't work.
"
"
Only had this a couple of months but I like it.  My only gripe would be that compared to the sonicare I had before, this brush is LOUD.  I guess it's the difference of having a rotating brush head vs one that oscillates at a high frequency.  All the extras are a bit of a gimmick, like the app and stand. The travel case is solid but it's large and heavy and it won't function as a charging station to plug in like sonicare diamond clean did.  Still happy considering the price I paid for it. Brush heads are much cheaper and seem to last longer too.  Teeth feel as clean as with the sonicare.
"
"
Omg I received this for christmas.I love it! After im done i literally have squeeky clean teeth.Within a couple of weeks i definitley noticed my teeth are whiter also. I like the counter to show how long i've been brushing. I'm interested to see how my next dental appt will go. I have small and crooked spots which were so hard to clean with a manual brush. The first couple of times my gums bled a bit, after that it was all good. I hated the feeling of the toothbrush in my mouth but am used to it now. I actually feel i have clean teeth when im done brushinh. Yes its pricey, but worth every penny!

I purchased this electric toothbrush set on Prime Day earlier this year and I could not be happier with the purchase! For years, I have used regular toothbrushes and I can say with certainty that I will never be switching back to them after using this toothbrush.The variety of brush heads allows you to use the product in several ways, ranging from regular brushing, to tongue brushing, to whitening/polishing. It also has several built-in modes that you can easily change on the fly with the dedicated button. It also includes a timer/clock that tracks your brushing and rates your brushing sessions to motivate you to brush your teeth for the full duration (2 minutes, people!). The brush has a pressure sensor that detects if you're using too much force and flashes a red light, which I really enjoy as well. Apparently I used to brush too hard, so I'm glad that I've fixed that habit.The toothbrush charges on the included dock and the battery lasts for about 10 brushes, so it's easy to pack it into its case and take it for a weekend and not worry about battery life. Personally I always return it to the dock after use so I've never run into any issues with the battery.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with the purchase and would recommend this toothbrush to anybody. The build quality is extremely high and its performance exceeds my expectations. 10/10 would brush teeth again.

Compared to the Sonicare that I used prior, this is noiser but appers to clean better and appers more rugged. Hopefully will last longer than the two Sonicares which only lasted less than 2.5 years each. Of course time will tell. Takes, as advertised,  almost full 24 hours for first charge.  The only reason for the 4 stars is not enough information on care of the Ni metal hydride battery. They do mention, to prolong battery life that it should be fully discharged at least every 6 months but there is no mention if after the full disharge it should be fully charge or not prior to reuse.
"
"
1st amazon has great delivery this time, 5 days earlier. I currently has Philips sonic care. it only last for 2 years and die with no reason. call customer service but never response. the OEM replacement brush quality is really bad. My old Oral B last more than 15 years and it still works well. Now I had Oral B and this 7000 works really good and 3D White brush has bought my white teeth back. No 1 Brand and Quality.
"
"
Great Toothbrush, so good that I bought a 2nd one for my wife.The phone App makes the system very easy to setup and use.Only issue, though expected, is that both the bluetooth connectivity to the display gets confused when 2 toothbrushes are trying to connect.
"
"
What a fantastic toothbrush.  Works awesome.  Gives you 5 stars for brushing properly on the display.  Vibrates/flashes to change sections on your teeth.  Really happy that I got this toothbrush!  Feels like walking out of the dentist everyday!
"
"
Fonctionne très bien. Mon dentiste a vu une différence.Le moniteur de temps fonctionne bien et lorsque tu appliques trop de pression sur les dents, le LED rouge est efficace.Batterie ne garde pas sa charge longtemps (Moins d'une semaine).Le module de charge aurait aussi pu être de couleur assortie.Même chose pour les têtes de brossage.Black édition se doit d'être NOIR... Tu payes en quelque sorte pour cela...
"
"
absolute teeth cleaner, I used many products before but this one surely pays off the price.  by the way, I don't use all fancy stuff it comes with such as Bluetooth software and the icon stuff, but the unit itself is great.
"
"
This toothbrush has pretty much every feature you can think of and probably more! Some even being a little unnecessary and just for amusement and I guess motivation for maintaining good oral hygiene.  If you can afford the steep price then I definitely do recommend this toothbrush as it is the best I ever used but if not then there are other brushes by oral-b that accomplish the same goal for less money.
"
"
this toothbrush is perfect, and for the price, its worth it, a lot of people think youre crazy to spend this much on a tooth brush, but for an object that you use twice, sometimes three times a day, its fully worth it,
"
"
Bought as a gift for my dad worked for a few days then suddenly charger died on me, Amazon replaced it, Whole family uses Oral B power brushes never had a problem other then battery eventually dying... Anyways great purchase and thank you Amazon for replacing a christmas gift!
"
"
Only been using item for a few days but works well. I appreciate how it encourages you to brush a full 2 minutes. Took a while to charge completely first time but now is great. Good purchase.
"
"
Gotta love Prime Days. Otherwise I don't think I would have paid full price for all the bells and whistles (bluetooth and separate timer). The travel case is awesome.
"
"
Very good quality and makes fore a good teeth! I would recemend this product to all the people I know.
"
"
Looked great until it took 24+ hours to charge and for a runtime of about 15-30mins total.Im very unhappy with this as now i dont have a toothbrush because i am returning this one !
"
"
Bought it to replace a previous electric tooth brush - very impressed.  Lots of power & battery seems to last forever.
"
"
Love it. Lots of functions and my tooth feel so much cleaner after using it.
"
"
Had a few Oral-B electric toothbrushes. This one functions great!
"
"
Lights are a little bright and flash when charging is irritating at night.  Hook up to phone is simple.
"
"
Gift for the girlfriend. Works very well, but will wake up anyone close to it!
"
"
C'était un cadeau de Noël pour mon mari, et il est très satisfait de sa brosse à dents !!Super achat et reçu très rapidement !Merci xx
"
"
Bought this before I lost all my teeth. Worked great. Now I use it as a vibrator.
"
"
The separate guide Is very useful and better than having it on your phone via Bluetooth like the newer models.
"
"
3 years of use, died. My oral B is 10 years old and works fine.Philips said “nothing we can do”.Never buying from them again.
"
"
Stopped working about year after purchace. Worse electric tooth brush I have ever bought.
"
"
Bluetooth feature is a useless grummick. But the watch gadget is useful.The product feels premium.
"
"
Pour me brosser les dents voyons! J’appréce les différents types de brossages offert par le produit.
"
"
I have always use Oral B. It is a great product!
"
"
I must admit, until I got this thing I really did think my toothbrush worked well.  It really is a dental cleaning type feeling every time you brush!
"
"
It is incredible the difference between using this and a traditional toothbrush, fantastic product and my teeth are genuinely whiter from using this. Would definitely recommend to friends and family.
"
"
Have been using a cheeper Oral B for several years. What a difference in the brush movement and vibration that improves cleaning. Very happy with this purchase.
"
"
Gift that doesn't let recipient get away with anything (brushing timer), LOL !
"
"
I love this toothbrush, ordered it on prime day and was worth it with all the extras that came with it
"
"
Love it. Never not going to use an electric toothbrush.
"
"
I love this. My boyfriend gave this to me last Christmas and I will never switch to different brand ever again. I really love the quality and style! I will surely recommend this to my friends. Good product indeed!
"
"
It really works, I wish I got an electric too brush years ago.
"
"
Genuine Oral-B and good quality toothbrush.
"
"
Cannot believe the difference it make!!!
"
"
Had it for a week so far and works great,noticing a difference already.
"
"
Delivered promptly and works great.

I can never go back to regular toothbrushes.
"
"
I'm very happy with this product as it does everything it is supposed to, however, I ordered a white unit and received black.
"
"
not bad  it's hard to find which mode I'm using.
"
"
It works beautifully.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned.
"
"
Fantastic electric toothbrush!
"
"
Sort of sad to see Oral B resorting to such marketing ploys as ""Oral B Precision Black 7000"" - this, and their hyped commercials to go along with it. Why not improve their technology?If you want a superior toothbrush, and for a similar price, invest in a Philips Sonicare! I owned both, and would never abandon my Sonicare for a clearly inferior Oral B anything --black or otherwise!!!
"
"
Vraiment fantastique!!!Très performante.
"
"
Love it!
"
"
Product is incredibly good!!

Already had one for our House in Langley and loved it so much decided to buy one for our Apartment in Vancouver. The whole family loves it

This toothbrush works. And while the toothbrush isn't a 2 star item, the entire package definitely is. I've wanted this toothbrush for years. Always lusted after it. Finally I decided to treat myself to this. Wow. So disappointed. Let me explain it all to you.The Bad:THE CHARGER: For any toothbrush over $100 I would expect a nice charger. Something substantial. And, look at the photos of the charging base with this brush - that looks great! But it's not. Not at all. First, have you seen those Oral-B electric toothbrushes you can buy for $15 that have the charging dock? I mean for $15 you get the charging dock and the electric brush. I ordered one of those cheap ones for my child. The charger included in the $15 set is model 3757. The model included with this set? 3757. You see that nice picture of the big sturdy dock in this set? No. It's not like that. It's a little $1 charger base, that you then click on 2 more pieces of $0.25 plastic onto it to make it look big an sturdy. It's a rip off.  Som, that means then the brush must be worth the $150 itself right?THE BRUSH: Have you gone to the grocery store, and bought one of those $7 electric children's brushes that run on AA battery? If you have used one of those, then you know what to expect here. See, I come from a competing brand of electric toothbrush that was different. This Oral-B is the exact same style, and type of brush head, and head movement as the $7 one my child graduated from. I couldn't believe it. That doesn't mean this doesn't work well, it does. But - where does all the $ go to? Ok, it's because it's Bluetooth and has the little happy face guy right? Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. If it was, I would at least, at the very least expect some basic memory features on the brush. What do I mean? I have sensitive teeth. The brush has 5 settings, with one of them being sensitive. So, I turn on the brush - it starts at full power and the timer starts running. with toothpaste flying all over - i need to hit the button on the brush a few times to switch it to sensitive. then i can put in my mouth. I'll clean up the mess later.  But - next time I use the brush, as least it will remember I turned it off on sensitive and start there right? Nope. Every single time - you need to go and tell the brush - only after it is started - what setting you want to use. It's ridiculous. You CAN use the phone app to change settings, even move some settings from the brush. You shouldn't need to download a phone app - to make these basic changes.THE OK:THE BRUSH HEADS: They are brush heads. They seem to work, again, the same as the $7 ones you get from the grocery store. There's no pulsing, vibration like you feeling with other brands. This feels cheap.THE 'CASE': so you put the cheap, plastic $2 base station together - and it lets you hold 5 brush heads. 3 of which are supplied. THat's ok. It's still cheap garbage though.THE GOOD:PRESSURE DETECTION: I grew up brushing too hard. I don't anymore - but I did test that on this brush and it emits a nice bright red light from the back of the brush to warn you if you apply too much pressure.THE HAPPY GUY: So this guy counts to 30, 4 times. Shows you what quadrant of your mouth to brush. It works fine. Shows you what setting your brush is on. Easy to set time on it. Made me realize I used to only brush about 1 minute total for the last 45 years. Now 2 minutes seems normal.CONCLUSION: There is no way this is worth anywhere what it sells for. I would say this is worth $80 at the most. Then maybe other companies would also start pushing cool tech brushes and real, well made base stations and chargers to create some competition. You can get the same performance for $15 from Oral-B on Amazon - just without the fancy tech. Even the $15 comes with extra brush heads.

My old Oral-B toothbrush , after many years of usage could barely make it through a brushing on one charge.  I bought this one which the battery lasts twice as long as the old one ever did (5 days vs10).  Love all of the upgrades with Bluetooth and all the hints on the app on how to get better cleaning.  I can feel the difference since the first brushing. I am extremely impressed!*** A couple months in now and I’m even more impressed.  I can see the difference now.  Stains that have been there for a long time are disappearing and my teeth always feel like I’ve just got a cleaning at the dentist.  Btw I will be getting a cleaning in a couple weeks and will see what the hygienist says.
"
"
This is a really good electric toothbrush but I believe is a bit overpriced if you buy it at normal price. I bought it on prime days with a really good discount so I'm happy with that.As a toothbrush, the various modes helping a lot. I didn't found the app very helpful, is more on the gadget side but if somebody keep tracking maybe it's worth something.One thing I don't like is the blue light when it's charging. It is staying on ad flashing all the time and this is annoying especially at night (my wife have the 8000 which have a smooth white light that's staying on only for a few seconds). I'm taking one star off for this.Overall I would recommend this toothbrush but with the right price.
"

This unit is incredible, no question about it!  I have been using the 5000 series for a few years now however dropped it a few times and the brush heads were no longer working properly.  I decided to upgrade to the 7000 and super happy I did.  The quality surprisingly is much better than the 5000.  The motor clearly is stronger or more refined if you wish.....just feels and sounds better.  How do I know this you ask because I had only an older unit to compare to?  Well I also purchased to brand new Bluetooth 5000 series brushes for my kids therefore was able to compare both units side by side.  One thing I noticed right away between the two units was with the different settings. As I cycled through the different settings, I noticed that the settings on the 7000 were much more profound or noticeable over the 5000 however for my kids who were using a manual brush, the 5000 is 100 times more beneficial when it comes to dental care over any manual brush.  These units after every brush feels like you just left the dental hygienist for a cleaning....they really are worth the money.  I do have to say one thing though....although the app is very cool and super robust, I found myself using the unit the 7000 comes with and grew tired of using the app and I'm a real gadget guy so take it from there.  The problem with the 5000 is that it no longer comes with the side unit that counts down or tells you which cleaning mode your on so the app might be more intriguing for purchasing the 5000.  I believe you can still buy the older 5000 unit with the side unit but I'm not sure if that one unlike the new Bluetooth 5000 and 7000 series, have the red light (brushing to hard indicator) right on the hand in place of it being displayed in the counter unit where you have to stare while brushing to insure you not brushing to hard.  And last, I gave this 4 stars only because the side unit that comes with the 7000 is poorly designed in that it sits flat on the counter meaning you'd have to be on your knees brushing to see it.......not sure why they would'nt have built it such that it could be tilted upwards so you can see it while brushing but ok!  It does come with a suction cup and housing to fasten to a mirror but really????? Like you're going to stick that puppy on the mirror in front to you every time you brush? Or leave it off to the side just to have to remove it every time you clean your mirror?  Not.  Other than that, this brush is the bomb and if you can afford the extra $$ to make the jump from the 5000 to the 7000 then do yourself a favour and do it.....ya won't regret it.

This being my first electric toothbrush I can't compare it to anything. It does clean the teeth. I wish it did just that without the glaring and blinking neon blue light that would be sufficient to beam an airliner down. Make no mistake, if you have a window in the bathroom, passerbys will know when you brush your teeth. I also find the handle very uncomfortable, almost like it wasn't developed to be a hand-operated device. Try hanging on to a tapered spindle. I also wish one could turn off the 2 or 3 minute timed stutter. Just want to clean my teeth without feeling I am still hanging out in traffic and someone is honking at me from behind. Ok, this toothbrush is for techno lovers that don't like to switch the static off. It's doing the job but is not something I would buy again.
"
"
This is my second Oral B electric toothbrush.  I was so satisfied with my first one, that I didn't even research any other brands.  The only reason I purchased a new electric toothbrush is because the old one would only hold a charge for a couple of uses, and would need to be charged again.It's a treat to only have to charge this one after 5-7 days of use!I like the styling of this toothbrush, and it comes with some premium accessories.  The travel case looks good and is very high quality.  I haven't used the bluetooth display very much, but shows the time and which part of your mouth you should be cleaning (there are four bars in a circle pattern, for left/right and top/bottom).  The charger is very basic and works well.  Plugging it in to charge before bed will result in a full charge in the morning.The one drawback with these toothbrushes is the expensive replacement heads.  There are cheaper knock offs out there, if the Oral B brand ones are cost prohibitive.After using electric toothbrushes for years, I would never go back to manual brushing.  2-3 minutes with this toothbrush and you feel like you have just had a professional cleaning!There are less expensive Oral B electric toothbrushes that can be purchased, if you want to try one out before buying in to the higher price range, but if you are looking for a premium model then I would recommend this one for sure.

Absolutely the best tooth brush I have ever had! I have been using Braun electric toothbrushes for over 17 years, and this one is by far tops them all. Recently, I had been using very simple Braun toothbrush for $30, and I noticed how build up near the gums is not being cleaned no matter how long I brush. I started to get some dark and calcium like building at the bottom of my teeth as well. I knew the time had come to buy a new one. I cannot tell you how happy and impressed I am with this one! All the build up is gone, and my teeth are visible whiter! I really like the smiley face and star system. It helps me to know how long I have cleaned my teeth for. The timer also serves me as a clock, which can be indispensable in the mornings. Overall, I am extremely happy with the purchase, because I can literally see and feel the results. Highly recommend. Also, what partially 'sold' me on this toothbrush is that it is made in Germany. A rarity these days when pretty much everything is made in China. Excellent product, superb quality
"
"
First get your teeth professionally cleaned and then use the toothbrush regularly; on your next visit you will see a big difference. That is what happened to me. The best toothbrush I have used to date. It is a bit expansive for a toothbrush, but I believe it is worth it.
"
"
I am a big fan of this brush. It makes me feel like I am getting a great, dentist worthy clean.(TECH) PROS:The tech side of it is simple yet effective, and even kind of scolds you if you don't floss for 4 days, which I love! It records when you brush, how long you brush for, if you applied too much pressure, if you flossed, brushed tongue, used mouth wash. It even gives you achievements for things (brushing 7 days in a row, brushing in the afternoon, etc.), which is hilarious but totally plays with my gamer side. Being able to set it up if you want whitening, or to help with bad breath, or whatever, is really neat. It will help you out by suggesting what brush head you should use, what toothpaste you should use, mouthwash... for the best results, albeit you don't need to use what they suggest. Also: you can get your dentist to put in what your problem spots are for extra attention, which is too cool! It will tell you when to change your brush head, and ask you about dental appointments.(TECH) CONS: While I haven't had problems with the range for my bluetooth, I have had problems with it not connecting with the app. Usually restarting the app will fix that.(HARDWARE) PROS: The travel case is sleek and easy to use, and can hold 2 brush heads. The brush itself is sleek, easy to hold, and the stand it comes with is simple and holds your extra brushes. The brush with vibrate when you should change where you are brushing, and flash red if you are applying too much pressure. It is pretty loud, but that doesn't bother me. The clock it comes with is cute, but with my phone app on beside me, it's not really used. This brush feels like it is cleaning everything, and my teeth feel fantastic afterwards!(HARDWARE) CONS: Replacement/extra heads are expensive! The brush itself is way expensive! I did, however, get it on sale for half off, and I felt it was worth that price for sure. I haven't used the toothbrush away from it's stand for more than 4 days, so I am not sure about the battery life, though other reviews say it only lasts a week outside of charge.I'd definitely recommend it, but mostly if it is on sale.
"
"
I was very disappointed with the Black 7000.  The toothbrushing mechanism and the anti plaque brush seem to be identical to the Triumph version which I have been using for many years.  The 1 second pause between brushing segments is simply irritating and the remote monitor is a gimmick which is certainly not worth the additional cost.  Despite the 14 day between charge claim I find that after a full charge, 4minutes use a day lasts only a week.  I certainly expected some new technology from Oral-B after so many years.
"
"
The battery doesn't hold a charge for longer than a week and takes nearly a full day and a half to charge. I'm not sure if this is normal or my unit is defective but it is annoying. I have an Oral B electric toothbrush thats a few years older that charges full in an hour and holds the charge for 2 weeks. Really disappointed that their premium product would perform so poorly. The blue LED's are also very (very) bright, and blink while charging.Looks wise it is very nice looking. I really like the new design and the colour (much better than the boring looking light gray on the older model). Also it comes with a couple heads so i didn't have to buy a refill for a few months. Well packaged.For potential travellers: the power plug is only rated for North American voltage so don't try using it overseas (even with an adapter) you can damage the battery. I had to leave this brand new one at home and bring my old Oral B to Europe because that would accept international voltage.Overall very disappointed and will be looking at getting a different brand when this one dies (which at this rate i'm sad to say probably won't be long). I've been a long time Oral B customer and advocate since my first electric toothbrush but am extremely disappointed at the drop in quality.
"

Pros: cleans teeth very efficiently.Has a variety of cleaning modes.Good battery life.Case feels good to the touch, so much so that you want to touch it every so often!Cons: Hand grip is very un-ergonomic; awkward in hand as if you're holding a long brick.Battery charge from dead takes a stupendously long time like 30 hrs; unacceptable. My camera's battery charger takes an hour!It does two little bumps every 30 secs, it's so annoying.You have no idea which mode it is unless you look at the lcd screen which would be redundant had it had the f***ing modes on its handle.No memory as to what setting was last used.In short, the guy who designed this had no idea what he was doing.  For the money you would think a little thought went into it, but no.

I thought for a long time before purchasing this:  Should I spend $200 on a toothbrush???The answer? DEFINITELY.  I have used so many cheaper models (Oral B, Philips etc) and this one does one heck of a job.  During my last dental visit they barely had to do any scaling.  It makes the whole dentist experience so much more enjoyable.The carrying case is a little bit bulky and has a foam inside which is sort of silly for a wet toothbrush.  It would be nice if there was ventilation so the toothbrush could dry.  It would also be nice if there was another way to charge it, like the Philips Diamond Clean carrying case.  10 day charge isn't long enough to take on a vacation so either I have to pack 2 toothbrushes, use a less great toothbrush for 2 weeks, or carry the awkward charger and bulky carrying case.

My dentist was extremely pleased when I told him that I had finally bought the Oral-B electric toothbrush, this one is perfect for me, I used it on deployments to Africa, and the charge lasts over a month, the Bluetooth is also fantastic, I can brush in my tent while the receiver is about 40 feet away, great buy
"

I have been using the same Oral B Triump electric toothbrush 9000 for ten years and decided to treat myself to this new one. It is amazing. I see a difference in the whiteness of my teeth and tartar removal already after only two weeks. Can hardly wait to go for my next cleaning and see if the hygienist sees a difference too.
"
"
During my last trip to the dentist the hygienist suggested I get an electric toothbrush. I drink a lot of coffee so presumably this would help with the staining, and also making sure the gums were okay near the teeth.So I went with this model and have being using it for about three weeks. It is one of the more expensive models, and it could be that you could get a less expensive one that is just as good, but I do not know. It was easy to set up. The instructions are mostly easy to follow and there is nothing very complex. There is an app that can be downloaded to your phone, if you want to go that way. There is a charging stand, and a container for the toothbrush if you want to take it on the road.If comes with three different brush heads. The head should be replaced after about three months of use. They are not cheap, so electric toothbrushes do create a self-perpetuating market for supples.I took it on a five-day trip and did not need to recharge it during that period, which was good.Overall, this appears to be a good quality product. I am satisfied with it so far, and would recommend it to others.
"
"
This is an amazing toothbrush. Before getting this electric toothbrush, I was having cavity issues (due to no flossing, lack of calcium and a lack of routine brushing). Oddly after acquiring this toothbrush, I started brushing more often, each brush was cleaner than when I used the manual brush, took shorter amount of time and used less toothpaste. I use the travel case that came with the toothbrush, and the timer is great too. I don't use the bluetooth apps as I do not feel I need my phone to brush my teeth. Overall I highly recommend this toothbrush because it is more effective than manual brushing for me. Its ease of use has somehow increased the frequency of my brushing as well. Even with no flossing, I have not had a cavity since acquiring this toothbrush.
"
"
I have been a fan of oral B for year, but not of this toothbrush, it last me 7 months after that it didn't charge at all, I got a second one and same thing, l cant believe how expensive it is and no quality whatsoever.
"
"
I bought this thing during the Mother's day sale, so the price was excellent, however, I have to say that the so-called features are a gimmick. I ""upgraded"" from a few year old Professional Care 8850.I must first admit that the toothbrush comes with quite a few accessories, including a travel case, which is very nice. Smart guide works very well, tells you which mode you're on, but seems to be judging me. If I don't make it for the full two minutes, I get a sad face, which ruins my day. Make sure you complete the cycle and you'll feel very good about yourself and the brush won't shame you.Has many more cleaning modes than my older model, but doesn't seem to clean significantly better or have a much better motor than the old one. I do like the red LED warning if you're pressing too hard.I laughed to myself when I saw that this toothbrush connects to your cell phone via bluetooth and has an app, but figured I might as well try it.  This feature does not work at all. Connects to my phone and immediately disconnects and then tells me I should brush longer next time. If you're going to advertise this as a feature, even if it's silly, it should work.Overall, it's a good toothbrush with many accessories, but it falls short of feeling like an upgrade from my previous model.
"
"
It's so good at cleaning teeth that I've decided to become an on call dentist going around the neighbourhood cleaning people's teeth for a small fee with this brush!It has different modes for different folks, battery lasts an insanely long time on a single charge and the bluetooth connectivity is more than just a gimmick. It actually promotes proper cleaning etiquette and helps you build a schedule to help you maximise your benefit from all the various brush heads they have to offer.Buy it, use it and impress your dentist with how clean and healthy your teeth and gums are!
"
"
I always thought these were a gimmick but my teeth feel so much cleaner.  I probably could have bought the less expensive one but I always options I don't use.  Beware of the heads you buy, I purchased compatible heads and they fell apart when brushing and they are choking hazards.
"
"
I have owned (including this one) 4 electric toothbrush by Oral B since year 2000 and a Philips that broke within 3 months.  Oral B quality and durability are superior. Not much to say about this model but any of this company’s toothbrush line I can get behind.
"
"
I got this product to replace an older (much older) version of Oral-B electric toothbrush that I had for years. Since I had the same for so long, I decided to go with the most recent model (at the time I bought it). I like all the features of this toothbrush - adjustable speed settings, compatibility with different brushes, sensor indicating if you are pressing too hard with the brush, convenient and easy-to-clean holder, casing for travel, etc. The battery life is just great! I've gone over a month without recharging it and regular use. I definitely recommend this product. (especially when on sale! great deal)
"
"
Très bonne brosse à dent, quoi qu'un peu cher pour un tel objet. La connection bluetooth fait un peu gadget mais on s'en sert quand même, tout comme les différents mode de brossage. Un point négatif tout de même: la batterie. Car pour s'assurer une bonne durée de vie, il est préférable d'effectuer des cycles complets de chargement, même si le manuel indique qu'il n'y a besoin de le faire qu'à l'occasion. A part cela, la batterie dure comme annoncée, soit une semaine environ. Bonne qualité de manière générale. Un plus aussi pour la boite de voyage, très utile.
"
"
I am very happy with this electric tooth brush.  I ordered it in Black because I had  one before in white {different model}and I noticed after time the white didn't stay  so white.  I thought the price on this was perfect.  I priced it in the store,  it was about $100. more than what I paid on Amazon.  This  comes in black and white.  I got the black.  As for the settings and the performance, I have no complaint.  Some reviews felt it was slow to charge.  I keep it on the charger 24/7 - I do not have any issues with slow charging.  I remove it only during use, everything is great.  Thank you.
"
"
This is a nice unit which leaves my teeth feeling clean. There is small effort from my side required and the spinning head does the most work.Have not run out of power yet since the base is a charger and with multiple heads its perfect for our family.Only issue is the base gets gunk build up even when cleaning the brush itself so you have to clean that. And maybe the base could be smaller.
"
"
Great job cleaning teeth:In 14 days of using twice daily my teeth are as clean as they have ever been. My only complain is a bit of gum sensitivity using the cross action head. I am confident this will go away shortly.Oral B customer service is top notch:My toothbrush arrived with a broken remote display unit. I called the manufacturer and had a new one at my door in 3 days.Some issues:The remote unit has a cheap screen and the app should allow you to add flossing sessions manually.
"
"
After 30 days of trailing this model and coming from an older high end Oral B toothbrush, what a difference. It is great to be made aware that you are brushing too hard as you would never think you were. Also gums feels so refreshed and teeth look and feel super clean. Absolutely love the application. The Bluetooth connectivity at first seams senseless, but after actually utilizing it, I find it a great tool for keeping up my oralHygiene.  Highly recommended!!!
"
"
Amazing! I switched from manual to electric and I was a bit worried because I tend to have sensitive teeth but this brush has been great. The different modes are really conviennent and I saw whiter teeth after one day of use. Really gives my mouth the « dentist clean » feeling. Will definitely buy one for my wife.
"
"
Works very well. It's relatively quiet, and communicates via Bluetooth without any problems. The downside is the length of time it takes to recharge: ~23 hours. Because of its slow charging time, plan to use a manual brush at least once every time.
"
"
Very pleased with the Oral-B Pro 7000, as this was a replacement for a 8 year old model, what a difference in technology in those years.  The digital clock interfaces with the device and give one a status of brushing, The only negative is the travel box is very heavy, but also very robust, but it is a bit overboard and could have been made much lighter.  When flying every OZ counts these days.
"
"
Prosfeels high quality3 brush heads includedmany modes and extra featuresGerman madeOral B brand something i can trustConsmany features but excessivetoo many extra parts, I perfer just a brush and charger that is it. no case.expensiveMy version did not come with bluetooth  but all other features are the same so i had to request for refund.  Very good electric toothbrush with premium feel and high price. I say it is worth it considering how expensive dentist charge . This is a small price to pay for good teeth.
"
"
The brush is good but battery is horrible, had it less than a year and now it won't charge at all and it's not replaceable. I think warranty is two years so will be contacting support but it is poor design to not be able to replace the battery. This device will not last you more than 2 years.
"
"
Have been using the oral B 5000 for some years now. This is pretty much the same with some new improvements. Firstly the lovely black handle with blue lights is a really nice touch and the premium feel of the travel case is a welcome update. There is also a tongue cleaning mode (where the pressure sensors are off) but I must say I don't use the modes other than clean and deep clean (3 mins instead of 2).The only thing oral B should really do for the next model is to please upgrade the battery to a lithium one as NiMH is such old technology with issues such as battery memory and the need for complete discharging, etc.Overall a great performing toothbrush with some aesthetic upgrades compared to the lower model 5000.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush, I didn't care for the all the Bluetooth stuff so I got rid of most of that stuff, nobody needs to ""track"" their brushing on their phone. As for the brush itself, my teeth have never been cleaner. At first my gums didn't like the power of this brush but delicate power setting let my gums acclimate to the increased brushing force coming from a good 'ol manual toothbrush.
"
"
I received a old box, there is a coupon expiring jul 2017, so I’m pretty concerned how long the battery will be good for.Honestly, you don’t need 6 modes, travel case, Bluetooth, a clock... if I was to redo my purchase, I would pick the basic one
"
"
Great toothbrush. I've used the sonicare black for the last 2 years and this one is way better! It's like I've left the dentist every time I brush my teeth. My teeth feel clean all day! I thought the timer was a little cheesy, but it's actually great!
"
"
This toothbrush works great, has alot of power. I don't like where the modes button is because I often hit it while brushing. I also can't really tell the diference between the diference modes all that much. I do love the soft travel case. The timer seems a little sily and it needs bateries so I'm never going to use it. I don't know why it couldn't have been somehow a part of the base and there for powered by it.  Anyway I got it on sale and I think it was a good buy. Never going back to a manual bruch that's for sure.
"
"
I was hesitant before making this purchase as i really liked brushing manually. But i bought this on Prime day at a discount and till this date I haven’t had any problems with this product. It has 6 different variations and speed. I didn’t use its time clock and we don’t even need that as the brush is programmed such way that it will take 2 minutes to finish all its modes. I would recommend this to everyone!!!
"
"
Seems to be to hard on my teeth even at a low speed.Bluetooth just seems to be a gimic unless you can't time 2min for brushing its not worth the hassle, stick to the basic models with a waterpic and your set for oral care.
"
"
Really like the toothbrush, the battery could for sure last longer, lasts about 5 to 6 days.I brush once a day for about 4 min.Also the ⏲️ i don't think its very water proof the numbers are already looking weird.
"
"
Love this thing. It has completely changed my dental hygiene. Interactive display with feedback on brushing. Motivates me to be more attentive and better enjoy the process of brushing my teeth.
"
"
The only concern I have is with the battery being NiMH. For those unaware it's an older type of rechargeable battery where a memory effect occurs. What this means is that if you don't let if fully charge and discharge, the overall capacity of the battery will lessen with use over time. For someone who's willing to pay the extra for dental health, I wouldn't have minded the extra cost for a lithium battery where the memory effect isn't as much of a concern.
"
"
Been using it for almost an year now and it's really been a great tool and I love the travel case that comes with it so I can carry it on vacation easily. Great overall buy. Clean my teeth and has slowed down my gum recession. Would recommend to all my friends.
"
"
Best toothbrush I've ever owned. I came from a ""manual"" though. I don't care so much for the crazy modes, not sure if anyone uses them, and the bluetooth function looks like a neat thing if you're really into your dental health. I am a brute and just use it for its sheer power. Gets into all those nooks and crannies. Would recommend.
"
"
The brand was recommended by my dentist. Love using the toothbrush, and the timer is a bonus. Also love the travel case. I wish there was some sort of a usb charge mode where this brush can be universally changed - even overseas on an extended vacation - hence the 4 stats. Other than that, I'd recommend this to family and friends, especially when it's deeply discounted.
"
"
First time ever owning a electric toothbrush and it was worth the purchase on prime day!It vibrates when it is time to move to another area of your teeth to brush! I would highly recommend buying this if you want white teeth!
"
"
Battery dies fast and you can feel it fading away after not charging it for a single day. Unlike lithium batteries, the strength fades according to the charge.Really nothing special compared to other, far cheaper products.
"
"
As of right now I am dealing with a faulty battery which will not retain a charge long enough to brush for 1 full cycle, after only 2 days of owning it. I'm going to give it another day or two to try and sort this out and then will be sending this back for a replacement. The product was excellent when it did work, and the features are great. Hopefully I can get over this charging hurdle without having to send it back.
"
"
Love this toothbrush!  Have been using it for awhile now and my oral health has really improved.  My dental cleanings take no time at all, my gums are really healthy (used to bleed a lot during cleanings).  There is also very little plaque build up.  Worth the money
"
"
I love the brush and see a big difference already. I have been using it for a couple months now.The charge only lasts for 1 week, and I brush twice a day.Not sure if this is normal, but my daughter has the same toothbrush and her charge seems to hold for almost a month, brushing twice a day.
"
"
It is a toothbrush... It is convenient to know how long to clean my teeth for but the little clock it comes with is a bit of a gadget lover's gimmick and unless you really feel you need the extra cues for teeth cleaning, not worth while. As far as teeth cleaning is concerned we shall see what my dental hygienist says in a few months. Which? UK (this is the unbiased version of Consumer Reports which is available in Canada and the USA) says that the Black 7000 only does an OK job compared to some much less expensive brushes. How many words can I realistically write about a d@<n toothbrush?
"
"
I was worried at first. Paying so much money and it had a damaged box. Overall it’s great but their is a lot of useless extras that comes with the brush. Many of them useless to me.But the brush is great. Shipping time was also reasonable delay.
"
"
Love the Oral B product. Got this item on sale and the display on my iphone just enhances the experience. My teeth feel extremely clean with this tooth brush. The added enhancement of pressure sensor is an added bonus since I have receding gums from brushing too hard with a manual brush
"
"
First few days of use and it is great. Replacement for one that just burnt out after 10years so hope this lasts the same.
"
"
These toothbrush works well.  Don’t  know that I really need to bells and whistles, but I do use the sensitive option to brush my teeth wth the sensitive brush.
"
"
It's a good toothbrush, but it isn't worth the premium you pay when compared to their ""lower end"" brushes. It likely has the same motor as the cheaper Oral B brushes. You still get a Nickel Metal battery instead of a Lithium.What are you paying extra for?... the style.Thankfully, I bought it when it was heavily discounted during boxing week.
"
"
Me and my fiancé both purchased one finally after many years of my dentist telling me to get an electric toothbrush. I feel it works much better than a manual toothbrush as if I just left the dental office after every use. Battery life is good, no complaints
"
"
Nous avons essayé un autre marque de brosse à dents ont la retournée et commandé celle ci et ont l’adore !
"
"
I was lucky enough to get this brush on sale. While I don't see a huge difference from any other electric toothbrush I've used, what I do appreciate is the small base it comes with for recharging. Other brushes have bases that take up a fair amount of counter space. This brush is the perfect size.
"
"
Had an old Oral B that stopped holding a charge. This one was on sale so I bought as a replacement. Do not need the gimmicky wireless timer that comes with it. Travel case is big and heavy. Those are my only 2 negative complaints.I have a Sonicare that I leave at the cottage. Both seem to work fine and I would not recommend one over the other.
"
"
Awesome toothbrush... honestly I was driven to this model because I travel and it has a really nice case with a very portable charger pod.It does work very well.  The clock is handy in bathroom too,  I never would have thought about that :)
"
"
Had a few electric toothbrushes this one is great to hold and build quality is good.....there was 1 time in the first week the red light kept flashing so I banged it on my hand fixed it...not hard!...it's an issue with oral b's.
"
"
Absolutely love this toothbrush! Thank Amazon for lightning deals! After only 2 days people started commenting that they thought my teeth looked whiter. Great buy!
"
"
Super excited to have it in my bathroom. Glad to use it and it's a real pleasure to brush my teeth and watch the small clock with the smiley.I really love the design, the quality ( i can select many options like for sensitive teeths or for whitening teeths...).Good n fast delivery !!! Excellent service !!! In a word, i was a happy costumer.
"
"
Fantastic toothbrush got this for an extreme savings during the Black Friday deals. Teeth feel even cleaner than with our old 3000 Oral B which we have had for at least ten years and just recently have noticed it doesn't hold the charge for more than 2-3 days but still works. Like the fact it lets you know on the brush with a red light that you are applying to much pressure.
"
"
I had my last Oral B electric toothbrush for 10 years so I was due for a new one this toothbrush is excellent and well worth the money I didn't think there would be much of a difference in the cleaning of my teeth from my old toothbrush but there was a huge difference I brush my teeth on the regular setting for two minutes and then a minute on the diamond setting and it truly has taken off the service stains making my teeth nice and white and feel extra clean! Excellent product!!
"
"
Works pretty good, lots of features. Bluetooth is a novelty but is good for adjusting the handles settings (the order of the different modes). App is only meant to keep track of one person so it's not suited for sharing the handle with a partner. Bluetooth connection drops constantly with Android but works well on iOS. So other than the Bluetooth and App issues is will clean your teeth like a champ!
"
"
Amazing product. Powerful and holds a charge well. Love how it signals the user every 30 seconds to move onto the next of the 4 recommended sections of your mouth. Bluetooth and app is cool but not very useful in my experience.
"
"
Love it!Easy to use, motivating and keeps you on track.Only thing I would like is that the app would permit to track more than one person's brushing (ie a child's)...
"
"
Too loud. Comparing to the old versionExcept of that- all is good
"
"
I decided to try the Oral B Precision Black 7000 after having had the Oral B Sonic complete for about 10 years and it still works.I have to say the 7000 makes you want to brush your teeth! It leaves a clean just from the dentist feeling on your teeth.The only con, with all electric toothbrushes is the base gets dirty and needs to be wiped daily.
"
"
The bluetooth features are a little overkill for me but the toothbrush is solid.
"
"
Le chrono bleu tout est déjà brisé mais pas vraiment utile.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush.So many functions, and my teeth have definitely gotten whiter and feel cleaner than they have ever before.Love the timer, and the carrying case is perfect for trips.Would highly recommend if you're on the fence about this product.
"
"
Excellente brosse a dent je l’adore tout simplement et tellement merci pour la rapidite de la livraison car j’avais si hate de l’avoir lol quel service merci c’est excellent
"
"
Excellente brosse à dent ! Jamais déçu avec oral B. Je ne met pas la cinquième étoile car trop difficile de se servir de l'app oral b connectée en tout temps. Mais un très bon produit que je recommande :)
"
"
\Has some interesting feature to insure good gum protection
"
"
La lumière qui s'allume quand on pèse trop fort, tres bien
"
"
The toothbrush is great, I love the speed and intensity of it (something I wasn't able to find with the other toothbrushes I got in-store). The issue I have which makes me not want to give a five-star review is that as soon as I opened the carrying case both the metal ends fell off. I'm either going to have to glue gun the ends back on or not use it at all. Super disappointing.Shipping was quick though.
"
"
This toothbrush works great.  It tells you exactly what you need to know.  I have always used Oral B and this is by far a fantastic hygiene tool!
"
"
Best purchase. Our teeth were actually noticeably whiter in just a couple weeks. It was insane. The movement was shocking at first on our teeth but after a few uses it feels normal. Love it.
"
"
The toothbrush works really well and meets all my expectations. My teeth have already started to whiten up and stains are disappearing. I had a bad case of teeth stains so I decided to spend big to clean them up. Definitely not disappointed. Some small things was that on the oral b website, it said it came with 2 floss action heads, but it only came with 1.
"
"
This is the best toothbrush I've ever owned! Awesome cleaning action that leaves your teeth super clean. Once you try this toothbrush, you'll throw out your old one with no regret. This is a MUST buy.
"
"
Works perfectly. Let's face it, it's not hard to brush your teeth. This just lets you do it more accurately with improved technique. You could get away with a cheaper model, but the smartguide is awesome and the app works amazingly well.
"
"
This toothbrush was delivered very quickly, which was important to me because my last one died. The charge lasts well over a week & it comes with a couple of different brush heads. I have have it for three weeks now & feel like I have been to the dentist recently.
"
"
I really love this electric toothbrush. It really makes my teeth/mouth feel more clean. It also helped me with my teeth sensitivity because I don't over brush anymore.
"
"
Amazing electronic toothbrush.I'm a smoker and drink coffee all day and honestly I only brush my teeth once a day and my teeth are white again in just 2weeks of use. It feels like you went to your dentist for a cleaning every time you brush. Definitely worth every penny😀!!!
"
"
I love this toothbrush. It was my first electric toothbrush and I will never go back. Cleans thoroughly and efficiently. I like the visual timer.
"
"
I have been a long time user of Braun electric toothbrushes and like its predecessors, this one lives up to its billing. My teeth feel as if they've had a daily cleaning by a dental hygienist and there is nothing better than that. Can you tell I love this toothbrush?
"
"
Already broke! Started losing power after a few months - I wish I had returned (the replacement-after my original one died within weeks).
"
"
Could not ask for a better toothbrush. This thing has exceeded all expectations.
"
"
Good Item, but why have Blue Tooth on a toothbrush
"
"
Le Bluetooth ne fonctionne pas avec mon cell sur android 7.0. Oral-B recommande 7.2, moi je recommande un modèle sans le Bluetooth, moins cher. Sinon, très satisfait de son fonctionnement.
"
"
Great toothbrush. Lot of power
"
"
I have owned Oral B toothbrushes for many years! This is my latest upgrade & I absolutely love it! Cool touch with the Bluetooth etc.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush, does its job perfectly.Numerous programs, easy to use, and cleans all teeth a very nice way.
"
"
Works great. Don't really use the bluetooth part since I don't pull my phone out just to brush my teeth. Cleans my teeth and they feel great.
"
"
I love my Oral-B as it leaves my teeth feeling ""dentist clean"".  The only problem with it is the little time indicator doesn't work.
"
"
I may be exchanging it. Love the timer and all the settings but the head vibrates a little to hard.
"
"
the product itself is ok, but when it is delivered to me, it's not in a seal box, it's opened, but not used. Looks like someone returned it and it was delivered to me within 24 hours, i was surprised. I kept it as it is not used
"
"
Excellednt product.  Would recommend and buy again.
"
"
GOOD TOOTHBRUSH, but I find that you cant brush that hard and get the good stuff, $5 dollar tooth brush is better. But overall good.BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY, THIS IS MY OPINION.
"
"
Have had many different electric toothbrushes over the years.  This one is the best.  Teeth feel very clean and brushing.  Also very sensitive on the teeth and gums.
"
"
Great product
"
"
Love this product, my dentist noticed I had changed things - said I was doing a great job at brushing!
"
"
Happy with it, but I think I will go with the sonic for my next brush
"
"
The brush has lots of power when it work.Most of the time the power shuts off on it's own and I have to turn it on a few times at time to complete my brushing.
"
"
The battery does not last as long as they claim. You have to charge it after 3-4 days of use. The travel case can scratch easily.
"
"
works very well, does as advertise, and while the phone app could use some improvements the fact that it will sync up after a few days is helpful if you like to monitor your brushing activity
"
"
5 stars
"
"
Teeth have never felt cleaner. I like the clock that comes with it. It gives you a simple goal to follow when brushing your teeth so you don't rush it. Also the pressure sensor made me realize I've been brushing my teeth way too hard.
"
"
I love this toothbrush. Love the blue light and all the modes. It feels solid and the travel case is really nice as well
"
"
Great product with a high price.  I always say ""Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is""!!!
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Great product!!
"
"
Really like this brush. I had a Sonicare for the last three years but decided to try the OralB. They are both very different in their design but achieve similar effect. Very simple to use and cleans really well. Very happy with this purchase and would strongly recommend it.
"
"
Purchased this product to replace an older model I had .  I love it - works great.Was delivered within the time indicated.
"
"
Very well built. Lots of technology in a small package. It feels like you're at the dentist office.
"
"
I love this tooth brush!!! Of course it is a little bit expensive comparing to others, but it worths a shot. So far I've triedb two brushes and I love them. Totally recommend to people who have sensitive gums like I do. It will make you enjoy brushing your teeth.
"
"
Simply the best toothbrush I have ever used. Honestly my teeth are way whiter and whole mouth feels better just using it. Fabulous!!!!!
"
"
Operates exactly as wanted. Its good. No issues with anything.
"
"
Love the toothbrush and great results . Only thing I dont like is the big bulky handle body. Its hard to hang on too.
"
"
As described
"
"
J'ai dû remplacer ma brosse Oral B après 20 ans. Avec l'achat de Oral B 7000, vraiment le Meilleur achat que j'ai fait. Et j'aime beaucoup la minuterie qui nous pousse vraiment à faire un brossage de 2 minutes...même pressée, ça devient un devoir !
"
"
tres bien
"
"
This toothbrush does it all.
"
"
Works very well but I wouldn't recommend it to everyone... very important to follow instructions...excellent product.
"
"
good construction, warns user when too much pressure, clock/timer works about 8 months on two alkaline cells
"
"
This one is perfect. I so love it! It keeps me away from ""yellow"" teeth and cavity for everyday use.
"
"
Product works as described.

I can't believe I didn't make the jump years ago! It feels like a professional clean. Your teeth are so important, I'm glad I purchased this! Worth it!!
"
"
The whole family loves this brush even I have given up my sonics diamond clean to use this brush
"
"
The toothbrush does the job but the clock and bluetooth are un-used.

Excellente brosse à dent électrique
"
"
very good arrived as described
"
"
This is an excellent electric toothbrush. Mouth and teeth feel so much cleaner and fresher.
"
"
Excellent toothbrush that surpasses my oral b triumph largely. Easy to use and light. Should have bought it long ago.
"
"
Love this toothbrush and timer.  Highly recommend.
"
"
it can brush teeth, i was looking forward in using the app but its only on iphone and androids i believe so i paid extra for nothing
"
"
Love this
"
"
Incredible - even better than I expected. Have already recommended to others. The only complaint is that the spare brush heads that come included are not labelled but a quick google solved that problem.
"
"
Amazing. Simply amazing. You want your teeth cleaner and healthier. This helps you tons.
"
"
Very happy with this product, works amazing.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush, however I was a little disappointed that I couldn't tell the difference in power between the 5000 and the 7000.
"
"
a supricely good tooth brush works very well! I gave it a 4 cuz the small helper clock gaget  is pointless and the brush has a very long charge time when the power is low! The price is very hi to.
"
"
Love it
"
"
It does the job, but I can't find any difference from Sonicare.
"
"
Works well!  My son brushes his teeth better!
"
"
Cleans like a charm
"
"
Super nice package. No problem with charging. Have used it yesterday night, feeds great. Pressure sensitive help you to brush better.
"
"
Oral B always has good products, this may be a little more than I needed, but all good and the price was right
"
"
It was a gift so cant say much about the functionality but bought it because it had good reviews.
"
"
bon
"
"
Works great. Excellent battery life. It is my second Oral B rechargeable and I could not go back!
"
"
A decent toothbrush and worth the money when on sale. BT is of course more of a gimmick, but if the brush is for a child, it may come in handy.
"
"
Teeth love this tooth brush
"
"
My teeth thank me.
"
"
Seriously..love my toothbrush..totally rocks!!!
"
"
I wish I would have bought this 20 years ago. It is almost fun to brush my teeth now.

Excellente brosse a dents.
"

This is the best tooth brush. It took 12 hours too charge and cleans like nothing I have every used before. I would recommend it good buy
"
"
Everytime I used this toothbrush it felt like I just left the my dentist's office with a prefect cleaning!
"
"
even better I was thinking

Does an amazing job!  Has every bell and whistle you could ever want.  Has multiple cleaning settings and if you like to track your routine the app works well and is easy to use!
"

"
"
Very fun and effective! I feel as if my teeth are cleaner with even less effort.
"
"
Works great with the iPhone app. I'm sure I remember to brush more now with the app reminder. A bit pricy for what it does, but I'm happy with the purchase.
"
"
Good.
"
"
i'll never use a manual toothbrush again!
"
"
Super
"
"
My husband really like this one.
"
"
Love this product.  Teeth feel smooth and clean after each brushing especially after the deep clean cycle.
"
"
Never going back to manual brushing. The different settings are great for all type of cleaning. In addition the travel case makes it easy to transport. Highly reccomentd.
"
"
It is great toothbrush, highly recommend
"
"
It's better than my previous Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush, so the product has improved with a new version.
"
"
Love all the different settings, especially the sensitive one. Dials the brush down a notch for those with sensitive teeth and gums.
"
"
This is a great product, feels as if you have came from a dentist every time. The only complaint I would have is the plastic base is a bit cheap and would be good if it was wall mountable.
"
"
It's no really worth to get the tooth brush with bule tooth device.The Brush it self is good enough to use.
"
"
amazing feel like just visited the DR.
"
"
I'm not good at brushing my teeth, so I find this to be incredibly helpful. I love the pressure sensor.

"

Improves upon my former Braun unit. May take a week or two to achieve a proper evaluation but, at present, I am happy with it
"
"
over priced and bulky and heavy. other then that its ok
"
"
it is as good as any OralB that you can get for $20 or $50. extra bells and whistles on paper really.
"

Great toothbrush ever, I looooove it.

Quiet while operating. A variety of settings. Love the travel case. Bluetooth is a bit over the top.

"

I love it. Appears as it will last for years and years.

It cleans much better than regular toothbrush. Good buy.

As my old Phillips Sonicare was giving it up and dying this week, i've found out it had a design flaw on it. On the Sonicare, the activation button is unfortunately not sealed so not waterproof.After a year and a half of daily use (2 times a day by 2 people), with water, saliva and toothpaste that got inside the mecanism, it started to rust and then PAWWW! The toothbrush wasn't working anymore.For those who never used an electric toothbrush, at first I wasn't understanding well what it was bringing more to brushing when using them but since I own one I had WAY LESS plaque and my visits at the dentist were far more ""fun"" and faster.So.... I won't suggest you the Phillips Sonicare after making a few searches, I've discovered I wasn't the only one to have the same trouble with them.After a few other searches and reviews reading, I've stumble on this really good quality model. The german Braun Oral-B Professional Care 7000.At first, it was way too much for my budget (240$ almost everywhere - Walmart, Future Shop, etc) until I've decided to give it a try on Amazon.ca and then I've found it here.The deal was amazing at 46% rebate (129$)It's one of the best electric toothbrush on the market.The head oscillates, rotates on itself and pulse. All that to stimulate your gums to prevent gingivitis and simultaneously removes deeply the plaque on your teeth.In addition, it comes with 3 different heads, a charging base and storage for your heads. It has a bluetooth brushing encouragement module (which suggests a 2-minute brushing - as all dentists do). It gives you the time (clock) when not in use. But when it sense that you've start your toothbrush, it automaticly starts a 2 min countdown showing you which quadrant of your teeth to brush.The toothbrush has 7 different modes of brushing, each adapting to your type of teeth, gum sensitivity, etc.It will tell you which quadrant of your mouth to brush and how long to brush it. It will also tell you if you push too hard on your gums by glowing a red light around the handle.Finally, it comes with a nice quality travel case (leather & metal) to protect your toothbrush and its heads when you're travelling abroad.For you, technology savvy, the toothbrush has a built-in Bluetooth module and can be connected to your cell phone (iPhone or Android) with the free app from Google Store or the AppStore.This means that you can download the application from Oral-B and your tooth brush will be connected to your cellphone, which helps you for a much more personalized brushing, controling every aspects of the brushing.With the application, you automatically will hold statistics about your daily brushing. Information that you can pass to your dentist at your next cleaning.Buy with confidence, it's a really good toothbrush you'll keep for years!
"
"
I must say that this is one fine product. Ive used other manufacturers but i was never happy with their devices. From performance to product quality. The 7000 is leaps and bounds above the ones i used before. Not sure how it stacks up against the 5000, but if its close then you may consider that model seeing that this model is pricey. Thats my only complaint thus far after a few weeks of use. I also dont find myself using the clock/timer that comes with it. But i must say that the quality behind the product is top notch, from the actual toothbrush to the carrying case and the other accessories. Very happy with my purchase. Love the warning light when im pressing too hard.
"
"
Product is annoying compared to my original Triumph from years ago.Here is what is wrong that made me angry:- We as a couple have one unit, with our own colour coded brushes ( which is why you have the colour personalization bands). However the Bluetooth app cannot track who is who making collecting stats for a couple, completely useless.The next major flaw is the lighting.  This brush has several blue LEDs thatlight up and stay on long after using your toothbrush, meaning the entire room is glowing blue at night if your master bedroom has anopen concept bathroom right next to it.  You have to put electrical tape around the lights - which provide little in funtionality.  Oral B just jumped on the LED bandwagon with no thought towards usability.The neoprene case is much much nicer than previous models, however does tend to stain slightly inside if any toothpaste rests on it overnight.
"
"
I got this tooth brush on time, so shipping was very good. However, I started using it and it really took forever to charge the battery to full bars. I thought maybe that's only happens the first time I charge it as it took three,,, yes,,, 3 days to fully charge. But it just kept doing the same thing until now. There is something wrong with the battery and they really need to have better quality control over these things as replacing the battery could be very costly and inconvenient. I used to have the 5000 series which had the indicator and you can see how much battery you have. This one you have to push the button to check the battery level.Also the Bluetooth doesn't start sending data to your iphone app and you have to enter everything manually which something that I really don't want to do when brushing early morning before heading out to work. I'm very disappointed.
"
"
Tough to rate really. I guess my ""iffy"" feelings could be someone else's awesome feeling about this. Not much "" wrong "" with it but I did return. Why?  Battery and charge time really surprised me at the length to charge. I know one can leave it on the stand to charge but my outlet is grounded so it shuts off with the light.  Not sure if that's me or most bathrooms so I guess I can't complain too much. I found the futuristic carry case and pouch and all that a little gimmicky.  I usually just tossed my old oral b electric in my shave kit. The Bluetooth??? Seriously???  Way gimmicky. Loading an app on your phone to monitor your habits is way way overkill for me. I didn't even bother with the headline news feature.  I don't need or want to bring my phone into the bathroom with me. So odd. I think this Bluetooth thing will backfire with this product. And just like my last brush, I didn't bother with the external brushing display. Another gimmicky piece to me. For fully swing on this you would have the brush going with the display and your phone. Too much IMHO. Having said all this, if you want to buy this, Amazon is the best price by a lot.  I did a comparison.  The 3000 model has the exact same ""motor"" and specs as the 7000 for $70 (a year of Amazon Prime) cheaper. So went that route. I won't miss the tongue cleaning mode. Or the deep clean mode or the extras.  All gimmicks.
"
"
I have owned an electric toothbrush for over a decade now. After a visit to my dentist, the hygienist recommended the Oral-B. I thought I'd give it a try, even though I was a big fan of the Sonicare. I bought a ""cheaper"" model and liked the Oral-B as soon as I started using it. When I saw the 7000 model, I decided to buy it because it offered many options (sensitive brush, white cleaning brush, tongue brush,...). Even though the price was high, I didn't regret buying it. It's worth every penny.
"
"
The charger is not working half the time I put the brush on it.  This happened 4 months after purchase which is just after the Amazon warranty period.  3 months is pretty short!  They told me to contact the manufacturer.  I emailed Oral B by they never responded.  I called them and they said to go to a service center.  The service Center said they will charge me for the repair even though it's under the Oral B warranty unless I email (form email) Oral B through their warranty department.  I emailed and again no response.If I had bough this at a store instead of Amazon I would have been able to exchange it for up to a year.  Buy it there instead.Lots of money to spend on an electric toothbrush that last as long as a standard toothbrush.
"
"
OK, this is a great toothbrush.  My previous model of this device lasted 10 years (with it being on the charger every day), and the battery finally reached the point where I could not brush my teeth for two minutes without it dying, so it was time to replace it.A couple of points.  First - the bluetooth seems like overkill but it does link to the clock and keep me on track for a thorough (3 minute on the + cycle) brushing.  I am not interested in linking this to my mobile device.  That would be overkill.The other thing that I miss from my old model was that with a press of the cycle button it would run at half speed when I was done brushing for cleaning the toothbrush.  This model is not so easy, and it takes several presses to find a mode that is less likely to spatter the tooth brushing foam.  However, that's a small complaint.It does stay charged for 7 days, with me using it twice a day for the 3 minute cycle each time.  Conveniently it flashes a yellow colour at the end of brushing to indicate it needs a charge.  Recharging basically takes 24 hours.Can't say as I am into using the other attachments other than the floss action head.  That I do like, which I find better than the standard heads. I will be switching once I use up the ones I have.Yes, it's an expensive toothbrush.  Consider that it will last you 10 years, and then the cost is a little more palatable.Those on a budget should perhaps consider a lesser model with the same brushing speeds, but less features.I'll use this brush (or it's next model 10 years from now) for the rest of my life.BTW, I get great check ups.

Purchased for 134.99 before tax some time in June 2016.Pros:- Comes with a clock and syncs schedule brushing on Oral App (clock is a handy feature in the washroom!)- Lots of features which include tongue cleaning, deep cleaning, massage for gums and many more- Teeth definitely feels much cleaner than a regular toothbrush, slipper teeth when you run your tongue on them!- Very powerful - might feel gum soreness for the first few days of use which is normal which means its very thorough and does a good job of cleaning away plaqueCons:- Takes forever to charge! Almost 3 whole days but I guess it last very long so its not too bad (won't be too bad if you charge it everyday)- The light is very bright (if you charge in your room, it could get annoying)10/10 would recommend this tooth brush!
"
"
Replacement for a 6 year-old version.  The pressure sensitivity sensor, with its red light, is really not needed.  The timer device, and bluetooth connectivity appear to be quite needless.  The case is roughly 2x the volume of previous version (travel impact).  Notwithstanding these comments, the Braun electric toothbrush is a great toothbrush.  My pref, build a version with a larger battery, market it in this way.
"
"
best price and best toothbrush out there.  after every brushing i feel like i just got back from the dentist office.  best electric tooth brush ever.
"
"
Good product!It was a gift for my wife. She likes it overall; but, she mentioned it to me that the battery does not last as long as her previous one, which was a different brand purchased in Germany.This one lasts around 1 week; the previous one could last about 1 month.Still, she is very happy with this!
"
"
My old Oral B that I had for more than 10 years died a few weeks ago and I replaced it with this more recent model. It is much lighter to hold than the older model. The On/off switch button is not well positioned, but other than this, it is quieter and cleans teeth efficiently. I'm pleased with my purchase!

I have been using this toothbrush for over a year now.  Overall it works very well.  The little timer is a gimmick.  it is neat at first but once the batteries run out you probably won't bother using anymore.  However the brush itself works great.  It comes with a selection of heads that match the different settings on the brush.  I have had no issues with the battery.  It lasts long enough for a week long trip.  The travel case is a bit bulky but very solid.  I make sure to drain the battery completely every couple months as it is not a lithium battery.  If you do that the battery should last for years.
"
"
love this toothbrush. Seriously, it's amazing

Wish the battery life was better but love the toothbrush overall. Dentist commented on the difference in my teeth before I even mentioned buying a new toothbrush. Def pricey but worth it in the long run

Honestly, this is the best toothbrush I have ever owned. Amazing product at a great price.Background: My electric oral-b toothbrush from Braun had lasted me almost 10 years before it died so I've been eyeing the 7000 series the last few months. The price was originally well over $200 which is quite off-putting but as soon as it went on special I decided to pull the trigger.Pros:The toothbrush itself feels amazing in your hand, light and easy to maneuver, and packs a lot of power. Even though I was using what I thought was an excellent electric toothbrush for the last decade this one blows it out of the water. Not only that but the timer really helps me focus on quadrants in my mouth to ensure good hygiene and I've really kept up with it so far. The extra modes etc make it really easy to take good care of your mouth. Honestly, the brush itself gives me no reason whatsoever to complain.Cons:There are none on the brush itself. The bluetooth connectivity, which easy and flawless, is slightly redundant given the timer that they give you with the brush but the app is well made and well designed and feels really good. I was impressed by the effort they put into the app but I am not sure how much I will be using it.The other major/minor con is the cost of the additional heads. As you know you can get 5 heads for $30ish dollars right now which is not bad but its certainly not cheap and add to the longterm cost associated with the toothbrush. I wish oral-b would reach out to long lasting customers and provide incentives and discounts but alas this is a minor quibble. If you can afford this tooth brush you can afford the heads.Summary:Excellent toothbrush overall. The plastics used, the quality of workmanship, the ability to clean my teeth - they are all excellent. I could not be happier with the performance. The cost right now is very reasonable given the long life I am expecting from this device; the extra heads and travel case are a nice bonus thrown in there too. I would seriously urge anyone and everyone to consider purchasing this product, you will not be disappointed.

I have brushed with a manual toothbrush for 24-years, for at least 5 minutes twice (*cough* that's debatable) per day. When working shift-work, brushing can feel like a chore at times. My dentist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush years ago-- I finally pulled the trigger recently. Honestly, this was really an impulse buy; however, I'm glad I made the purchase.I use the 2-minute mode on the brush (down from my 5-minute routine with a manual brush). At first 2-minutes felt like nothing; however, my teeth have never felt this clean before (aside from when going to the dentist for a cleaning). I guess I've been brushing the wrong way for 24-years, FML haha.I HATE brushing, and push it to the last minute before bed. Sometimes this procrastination drags on until 1am when I have to be awake at 5:30am. It's weird to say, but I actually enjoying brushing with this toothbrush. There's no effort involved; you can just hold it in your mouth while you're still half asleep and still get a better than average clean.I normally don't review products as I couldn't care less about wasting my time on such a thing; however, since this essentially opened my eyes to oral hygiene, and that brushing doesn't have to feel like a chore, I chose to add a review. I'm actually pretty anal (can we even say that?) when it comes to brushing now.
"
"
Pros: Good quality product, easy to use,versatile ,  looks goodCons: noneWorth the investment
"
"
Give me a break ..it's just a really expensive toothbrush for my 86 year old husband and I can't figure out how the clock works or how to set the toothbrush ..or co-ordinate it with a smart phone ..or whatever ...was just looking for one with a brush that went in a circle not back and forth movement ..and there were not many to choose from. I told my husband, put toothpaste on the brush, put it in your mouth and use it ..enough already!
"
"
Had the older model and see a significant difference with the newer version. This one seems to rotate faster and leaves teeth feeling very clean.
"
"
The toothbrush works great but I thought being Bluetooth it would be more interactive! The toothbrush comes with three heads, a charger, a mount to hold toothbrush and heads and a timer. You connect to an app which sync with the toothbrush and you can choose one of their programs which will remind you of proper brushing. On the app, during sync it will give you 30 second for each section: top left bottom left top right bottom right and then the remainder timing on your front teeth. While sync to the app it definitely helps keep you on the min 2 min brush time recommended but I am yet to figure out the value or purpose of the timer/clock thing. I thought it was a timer but it does it thing and randomly smiles and counts time and then countdown etc etc and my box did not come with a manual so not sure how to fix it. Anyway good product overall to keep you on track for brushing but don't see any value to the timer included with toothbrush.

The kit comes packed with accessories, as expected from a high end electric tooth brush from Oral B. However, in my package I was missing 2x brush heads. According to Oral B's website, the kit should have come with 5 brush heads:- 2 CrossAction Brush Heads- 1 ProWhite Brush Head- 1 FlossAction Brush Head- 1 Sensitive Clean Brush HeadMy kit only came with 3:- 1 CrossAction Brush Head (preinstalled on handle)- 1 ProWhite Brush Head- 1 Sensitive Clean Brush HeadFelt a bit cheated because of the missing 2 brush heads but a quick chat with Amazon Canada quickly resolved that.In addition to the supposedly 5 brush heads, you also get the following:- 1 Oral-B Pro 7000 Handle- 1 ""Premium"" Charger (LOL) with Refill Head Storage- 1 Premium Travel Case- 1 Travel Pouch- 1 SmartGuideThe handle itself is excellent and is well crafted. The build is excellent and feels like it's worth its price. It's got alot of various modes for all your brushing needs. The travel carry case is indeed worthy of the title ""premium"". It is a hard carry case that feels like a carry case for very expensive glasses. It also comes with a small travel pouch which I assume would be for the travel charger. The new SmartGuide pretty much works like the old one that came with my Oral B Pro 5000. Beyond cosmetic changes, I think the guts are the same. The handle, brush heads, charger, and SmartGuide are all made in Germany. Only the travel case is made in China.I see alot of people complaining about the 7000 still using nimh batteries instead of li-ion. I've have had a Vitality, a 1000 and a 5000 for a good couple years already.  All of them had nimh batteries and they are all still alive and working to this day. I can't say the same for my most of my older smartphones (using lithium ion batteries) which either cannot keep charge or the batteries swelled up considerably.  I have no complaints about whatever Oral B is doing for their tooth brushes as long as they remain reliable.Finally, my only complaint about this toothbrush is the charger. This so called ""premium"" travel charger still only works at 110V to 130V which makes it useless for many parts in Europe. Come on Oral B, why is your top of the line tooth brush still using the same crap as your cheapo handles? I mean I'm looking at my the charger that came with my $20 Oral B Vitality tooth brush and it looks identical to this one and operate at the same voltages. What's the point of all those fancy travel accessories if the charger don't even work for traveling (unless you travel exclusively in North America and wherever else that uses that 110V to 130V voltage range). Knocking one star for that.I got the new 7000 because of the bluetooth/smartphone connectivity feature but turns out I never bring my phone with me when I brush my teeth, so I ended up never using that. I actually did try but it felt like such a chore. Maybe if your phone is close to your bathroom, it could work. The SmartGuide works well enough for me to not miss this feature.

Amazing!I bought this item for my wife. She has notoriously bad teeth and constantly has cavities which is costing a fortune in dental bills. Since buying this for christmas for her it has turned all that around. Not a single issue with her teeth (its been more than a year) and her dentist is thoroughly impressed. I was so impressed that I gave it a try myself. I have never imagined that an electric toothbrush could be worth this much money but I am now a believer.The grip is smooth on the unit but I find the crescent shape of the grip a little odd in my larger hands. the interchangeable heads are a great bonus and the handy holder on the charging base is a plus. I find the carrying case is very nice and we have used it often when visiting family. the bluetooth computer display that accompanies this product is a fun gadget. my wife was hell bent on getting a perfect score (rated by pressure and duration of brushing) and it does a handy countdown of 2 minutes with a grid to indicate what quadrant of the mouth to brush. I found this very helpful despite thinking it was unnecessary at first.I dont find a difference in the brushing heads (pulishing brushing...) despite several trials. Its nice to have the extra heads so that I can have my own however. It holds a charge very well, allowing a dozen brushings before needing to be returned to its base. This is handy as you dont have to lug the base on every trip you take, just fully charge and good for a week or more.I would highly recommend this brush for anyone regardless of oral hygiene. It will improve your brushing habits and provide a great cleaning in the process.

I love this toothbrush. I went from having a lower end electric toothbrush that was dying to this. What a world of difference. The bells and whistles are cool, but not necessary. The little timer/clock thing is fantastic! I haven't used the Bluetooth more than a few times, but I use the timer/clock every time I brush my teeth. I'd say this is the Cadillac of toothbrushes.
"
"
I didn't order it from Amazon but I do have one of these and the Bluetooth stopped connecting just after the 1 year mark. Would be a great toothbrush if the technology worked. Yes, I tried it on multiple devices (both Android and Apple) it just won't connect to anything anymore, including the timer device that's included in the box.
"
"
After just over a year the battery is almost gone.  So the need for the fancy travel case is definitely not needed as I can't take it anywhere unless I'm packing the charger.  For someone who travels a lot, this is not ideal.  I don't use the fancy travel case any more as its heavy and bulky - a bad combo for travelling.I have used Oral B rechargeable toothbrushes for over 20 years as this is by far the most disappointing model I've owned.  Its also one of the most expensive.  I definitely would not buy it again and certainly not in black as it highlights any toothpaste residue.
"
"
I bought this thinking it would be able to last much longer on a charge and be able to perform better than the basic Oral-B electric toothbrushes, boy was I wrong! I find that I still sometimes have to use my manual toothbrush after using the electric brush. I actually regret not trying the competitor instead. Given the high price, I would not recommend this product.
"
"
Best electronic toothbrush out there! The app does sometimes stop working but honestly who really needs an app to brush their teeth? You can see and feel the quality of this toothbrush & the accessories. I thought the timer would be useless but I have to say it's really practical in knowing how much time is left for each quadrant of you mouth. Tong cleaning option is also really cool and does work. Just waiting for another sale so that my wife and I can have our own...
"
"
Great product, forces us to brush our teeth consistently and keeps our progress in the APP.I was skeptical about a bluetooth toothbrush but i do not regret the purchase. it won me over after using it just once.We'll see how it goes on the long run, satisfied for now.

This is our 3rd Oral-B electric toothbrush. My wife and I have always been partial towards them as the smaller round head of the Oral-B system worked best for us in cleaning tight, hard to reach areas such as wisdom teeth.We've owned a basic Oral-B model many years ago that we eventually replaced with the Oral-B Professional Care Triumph about 6 years ago. The Triumph is the predecessor to the current Professional Care 5000 and also came with the Smart Guide.Our Triumph served us well. The battery eventually started losing charge, lasting only a few days before needing a recharge. More critically, the plastic started to chip around the top causing the head to twist somewhat loosely, so it was time to replace it.We compared the 5000 and 7000 and really had a hard time choosing until Amazon.com (U.S. site) put the 7000 on sale while at the same time Oral-B was giving an additional $30-off via an instant online coupon, making it cheaper than the 5000 so I decided to order it.Even with the exchange rate, shipping to Canada, taxes and duty etc... it came to ~$30 less than the lowest Amazon.ca price, which itself was significantly cheaper than all Canadian brick and mortar stores (which were all selling for above $200). And to my surprise the package that came was the full retail Canadian packaging with both English and French text, manuals and included both US and Canadian warranty.There are two disappointing things about the 7000 that I should mention:1. The battery is still NiMH. I had hoped that Oral-B had finally transitioned to Lithium Ion but they haven't.2. The included AC charger is 110V only. My old Triumph included a world charger (100V-240V) which now Oral-B sells separately.These might be deal breakers for some but I knew going in about them and they didn't impact us. First, our old Triumph also had a NiMH battery and with proper care (e.g. complete discharge every 6 months) it easily lasted 5+ years; by that time we started seeing other, more pressing, physical breakdowns necessitating a replacement. Second, the 10-day battery life on the 7000 covers most of our trips outside North America.Now if you can live with these two limitations then you're in for a real treat with this toothbrush. Compared to our old Triumph, which we still consider it to be a great toothbrush, this one just trumps it in most respects.It's thinner and lighter yet Oral-B managed to somehow retain, if not improve, the feel in the hand. The outer casing has rubbery parts and is more sticky (in a good way) than the Triumph which was very slippery especially when wet. Operation wise, button layout, modes etc... are almost identical (the 7000 has one additional mode than the 5000 - 6 modes in total) making it really easy to pick up and use without even reading the manual - it's very intuitive.The toothbrush, shockingly, took almost 24 hours to fully charge from a complete discharge state, which is much, much slower than any of our previous toothbrushes. This is partly due to the use of a NiMH-type battery, but more likely I think Oral-B went to a new charging model (old Triumph charger does not work with the new 7000) where it now trickle charges instead of the old fast charge method. Upon further researching, if it is indeed true that this new charger is a trickle-type charger, then it's a good thing as evidence suggests that trickle charging these types of batteries not only reduces heat and wear on the battery but can in most cases significantly prolong battery life and charge cycles. Maybe that's Oral-B's small way of combating long term battery issues without going to Lithium Ion.The new Smart Guide is a little smaller but unlike the old one which when sitting its LCD display was angled slightly up, making it easy to read, this one sits with its face perpendicular to the surface so when looking down on it the display is a little faded. It comes with a clear mounting apparatus that allows you to have it mounted on a bathroom mirror. I found that with the mounting apparatus installed, but without actually mounting it to a mirror, you can have it sit on the counter with the display angled slightly up, making it much easier to read and this became our preferred placement option.While it is nice to see the timer and sequence of mouth quadrants while brushing, I don't think the Smart Guide adds much value overall. However we do find that it makes a great bathroom clock so that's handy.The travel case that's included is really nice. So nice in fact that I almost feel like I need a case for the case. The inner lining is removable and can be washed in a dishwasher.The kit included three different Oral-B brush-heads. Our favorite is the Floss Action; one of which is included.Up to four brush-heads can be stored neatly on the charging base and each brush-head, as with most Oral-B units, can have a different colored ring on the bottom to differentiate individual ones (his, hers etc...).But where it counts the most, teeth cleaning and gum massaging performance, is where ultimately one decides whether this is a good buy or not. And boy is this ever great in those regards. After using it the first time, my teeth and gums felt phenomenal, got that tingly sensation back (that one you get right after a thorough cleaning by a dental hygienist). I had used my old Triumph merely a few hours earlier, using the same head, and the difference was night and day. The pulsations on the 7000 felt noticeably smoother and tighter than our Triumph. My wife felt exactly the same way after her first brushing. We threw away our trusty old Triumph immediately after that.This is by far the best electric toothbrush we have ever used. I highly recommend it. My only gripes are that Oral-B stuck with NiMH batteries and they no longer include a world-adapter. For the asking price, I think it's only reasonable to expect those two shortcomings be addressed. Despite this, we still gave this brush 5-stars based on its most important virtue, performance.

I don't ever use the Bluetooth functionality, but the brush itself is terrific. The various modes are handy, especially for sensitive teeth/gum - and it looks nice!

Worked great for 2 months. Then just died. No vibration any more. There is nothing you can do. It simply stopped vibrating despite a 24 long charge and indication that the battery is fully charged. Wrote to Amazon. Will see what happens.Update ! Amazon wrote back, gave me a customer service line for philips. I called and got through on the first call, no wait. Few questions later my product was replaced. I’m happy again. Perfectly working.
"
"
I have to give it 1 star for a simple reason; the charging mechanism in unpractical. For this model, the only way to charge is with, literally a drinking glass. One cannot fit the toothbrush into the base without the glass and if you do not have the glass ( broken, missing or traveling), you cannot charge this model. This is a major, major restriction. The only other option is to order and buy a separate charging carrying case. What were they thinking? A breakable drinking glass to charge. They could have made the brush also fit into the electric base but a genius designer never thought of that. I am hesitating returning it, or ordering the charging case. Buyer beware.
"
"
This is my second Sonicare toothbrush. My other one was old and getting a little worse for wear. I finally broke down and bought this one and it’s well worth it. The app works perfectly and the set up was a breeze, you don’t have to be technical to use this brush or the app. They work seemlessly together... my only issue is that the sensor doesn’t accurately tell you where you’ve brushed/missed. I’ve tested it several times by only brushing in one area and it picks up that area as not brushed and others brushed. I’m hoping this can be some sort of update they can fix.
"
"
First off, I don't use or need the smart-app capabilities of the device.  Talk about pandering.But this is so much better than my 2016 SC brush that died.  How do I love thee? Let me count the ways …- Sweet grey colour.  Really is good looking.- Light in base activates if pressure too strong.  Who needs the smart app with this?- Feedback when pressing too hard with the brush, or every 30 or seconds to indicate ""quadrant brushing time"" is up.- Two buttons. One to turn the unit on or off and one to cycle through 3 speeds- Charger base is black, and the charging glass is a more modern style- Works great, cleans in a jiffy, with the bonus you can ensure all toothpaste is washed off the brush because of its colour.- Is FAR quieter than any ORAL-B tool.- Pricey (loses value star for that) but damn, this is a fine toothbrush.
"
"
In terms of cleaning your teeth this is an excellent product.  Even my dental hygienist has noticed a huge change for the better - and for this reason alone I bought a replacement as soon as my first one died -right on the expiry date.  A family member had the same experience with theirs - it expired with the expiry date.  So its expensive to have a buy a new one every two years, but arguably you are saving it on dental bills.
"
"
This is an expensive toothbrush but I decided to try it out.  I’ve been using my Sonicare for about 3 months now and my hygienist said she sees a reduction in the amount of tartar I normally have.  That makes this product totally worth it.  I took one star off for the app connectivity.  I like that it will track my brushing but I don’t keep my phone in the bathroom.  It’s not convenient to get my phone before I brush my teeth so it’s not recording the data.  This is more my issue than the brush, but I wish it’d save my data so I could track it.  I do really like little glass cup it charges in.  Much nicer look.
"
"
The cleaning is incredible. I noticed the difference after just a few days. I had been using the Sonicare Platinum Plus for years.The app is inaccurate and useless. I stopped using it after a few days.Sonicare has a new Diamond Clean without the 'Smart' capability but with a USB charging travel case. That would be my choice knowing what I do now. It will also save you a fortune in replacement 'Smart' toothbrush heads.
"
"
I bought this to replace my 3 year old Diamondclean (battery died and I didn’t want to open it up and replace it.) I chose the black colour to switch it up (I previously had white) and I like the black one a lot. Finding black heads are harder so I’ll see how that goes when my 3 heads are no longer useable. I have extra white heads from Costco - I’ll use those up before I buy more. It will look weird, but oh well.When I first started using this brush, I used the app.. but after a couple weeks, I stopped using - mostly because I forgot to bring my phone into the washroom. But I really liked the app - it changed the way I brushed! Now I try to mimic the way I brushed according to app. I suggest the app for people who want to take their cleaning seriously or who are new to brushing with an electric toothbrush.Overall, these are pricey toothbrushes, but well worth it. It’s an investment. I went on holiday with it fully charged and it lasted almost 3 weeks.
"
"
This is an amazing product which is worth every penny you pay for it (even if it did not have that phone app which I do not use). I don't think my comment will express all my satisfaction I have with this product. It makes brushing a pleasure.Recently, I started to develop some black stains on my teeth and this brush is very good for fighting those stains and plaque. After every brushing I feel as if I came out of dentist's office. My first handle was malfunctioning very first day and I contacted Philips via their live chat service and the service they provide to their customers is SHOCKING good. They advised charging it for the first 24 hours and when it did not help, they send me a new handle. After using this toothbrush, you will never want to go back to manual or any other ones.
"
"
It is dentist recommended for a reason. It is excellent.I really really wish I had bought this a long time ago. Much better than a regular toothbrush or one of the cheaper electric ones. I've had mine for nearly 3 weeks now and I already feel and see a difference in my teeth. The app is great to keep an eye on the amount of time you need to spend in a certain area or to show you if you missed areas while brushing. One downside with the app is that sometimes it has trouble connecting to the toothbrush so you need to put it in the charging dock to fix that. not ideal but not a big deal by any means.It is pricey but so far I would have to say that it is definitely worth the money.

The product overall is good. It is the post-purchase service being painful.The charging base stopped functioning in august.I called customer service immediately and the reply was kind.Says they will ship me a new one.It is now October 25th and no ETA was provided
"
"
Now look, I'm totally with you. This seems expensive. No, it is expensive, not just for a toothbrush, but any personal grooming hardware. I promise I hummed and hawed for months. I was not let down. My teeth and mouth have never felt so clean, save for post dentist. I had the cheap version without the bells and whistles prior to the 9300. This experience is the difference between a regular manual and the entry level phillips. I cant imagine the 9700 version being that much better with a couple extra brush heads... This is a great buy at 200 dollars. Happy brushing!!!
"
"
Great product! At beginning, it feels a bit of too strong, even the lowest power feels strong. but when you get used to it, the teeth feels sooooooo clean.!Wish I had order the charging travel box with this teeth brush. the one coming with this purchase is ONLY a travel box with no charging.
"
"
I have been using Sonic Care for about 20 years. They are an excellent toothbrush, and customer service is great. The Diamondcare is at a different level to other toothbrushes - it blows away my parents' Oral B electric toothbrush. My friend who is a dentist told me nothing compares. You are spending more on this - but it is your oral health - and you will immediately see the difference.
"
"
We have four other Sonicare products that have a USB charger in the travel case which is extremely useful when on the road. This model is supplied a case that has no charger! For me, this is a huge negative.
"
"
I've only had this for 2 days, but the title says it all. It's convenient, I never brush too hard, and the app helps me clean everything evenly. Will probably save me its price in dental bills in the next few years.
"
"
Ok pour un nettoyage en profondeur. Beaucoup plus performante que mon ancienne Diamond Clean qui a rendu l'âme après au moins 5 ans de service si c'est pas plus. J'ai la sensation d'être sorti de chez le dentiste, très bon produit.
"
"
After a mouth or two, the toothbrush already dead, this is the worst Sonicare product I ever had.The power botton is really poor, the app almost useless, I call the Sonicare severe line, they asked me charge the toothbrush 24 hours, and have to use app to brush teeth every time, is that real? If it is, what a brainless design.
"
"
Like the handling of the brush. Still too early to comment on results.Download the App but still not able to use the instant feedback during usage? Did not realized when ordering this model that the Travel case did not come with charging cord, not mentioned on description of product.
"
"
This was a replacement, my 3rd Sonicare.  The newer feature where the vibration changes if you press too hard is very helpful.  I wish we could change the battery.  Once I viewed a YouTube on how to take it out, I was very leary of trying.
"
"
Love how you can easily track your brushing and the app is simple and easy to use. It’s a great motivator to do a complete 2+ minutes of brushing as you can see what areas in your mouth need a bit more attention and which areas you’ve well covered. Highly recommended!
"
"
Seriously it’s like dentist level clean- I love this toothbrush and the app is fun to use for the visual when brushing. The charging cup is pretty great too. I don’t think I’ll be going back to using any other toothbrush for the rest of my life
"
"
My wife and I ordered this in half year ago. We love it! At the beginning, it is little bit difficult to use -- you may use the App to instruct you to bush correctly.  We use it twice a day, feels better, cleaner tooth since then.  Highly recommended.  We also bought extra Philips brush heads.
"
"
Great toothbrush love the way it connects to my phone and thru the app can manage how I brush shows where u missed and where you may have over done.
"
"
Worked for 5 months then didn't function, I reached out to this seller and they don't want to help replace it said it has nothing to do with them!Be warned even though it is under warranty this seller doesn't want to help
"
"
I have used both and found sonicare to be less efficient and less of a joy to brush teeth with.  I couldn't believe how powerful it was at first.  Maybe 2 powerful.
"
"
For the value I don't think it is worth it.I just think it is incredibly a WASTE of MONEY.But if you've got money to burn here is your item.Enjoy.
"
"
I was very disappointed with this product. The tooth brush only worked properly for a month, the second month it was glitchy and by the third month it did not work at all. This is not a cheap product so I expected it to last longer then 2 months. I won't be purchasing any Phillips products in the future.
"
"
Arrives quickly and exactly ad described. This electric toothbrush is excellent. I have used different Oral B including top of the line but this Sonicare is best. Easy on gums compared to Oral B
"
"
I just love it! The performance is good and it is so beautiful! Placed order on the 17th and arrived on the 24th. Used for a week and so far I feel my teeth are cleaner and smooth, also a bit whiter then before. So satisfying! A bit expensive but totally worth it!
"
"
Best toothbrush ever! Amazing quality. I am never going back to a regular toothbrush. I don’t know why I didn’t purchase this awhile ago. I Just wish I could use the app without the internet
"
"
Does not connect through bluetooth. For the price, it should work flawlessly.Colour and feel is nice.
"
"
I bought this 6 weeks ago and it has broken already. The last Phillips I had lasted me 3 years and this one turned out to be a lemon. Also, this company is being very difficult to replace it. I'm very disappointed given then price I paid for it.
"
"
I use this toothbrush daily & love it.  It lasts two weeks between charges.
"
"
Had this brush for a few days now, my teeth have never felt cleaner! The app tells you if you're moving to fast, and if you're applying to much pressure. The brush is very nice, quieter than expected, and cleans very well! Would recommend to everyone!
"
"
Great product. Only dissapointment is travel case does not have usb charger so can only charge in glass. Go with 9500 to get chargeable travel case.
"
"
Great toothbrush, love the colour. Although this one doesn't have the stand so the toothbrush can stand upright on the charger, just has the charging glass.
"
"
The software behind it is useless and a waste of time. It's not accurate so doesn't give useful information and it doubles the amount of time it would normally take to brush your teeth. They make you jump through hoops to get a refund on the product, so the 90 day money back guarantee is useless.
"
"
The produce arrived ahead of schedule which is fantastic with all that is happening. The new model has more features than the old one. Excellent product.

I must return I thought this is one came with a USB charging travel case ... which is what I’ve always had ..

Like the look and brushing. There are 2 of us and it’s not apparent how to track brushing separately for 2 people.
"

it is expensive but it is definitely worth the money, great experience.
"

This is by far the best toothbrush ever!!!Not sure if all those settings are all that important, but the deep clean is great!!!

Best toothbrush i have ever bought. Cleans so well, its gorgeous, and i love the wireless charging cup. I got pink
"

Bought this for my wife, she loved the performance also the color.  Greatly reduced plaque.  We both have one now.
"
"
I'm enjoying using my new Sonicare - looks great, works quickly and easily, and makes an annoying duty now a fun few minutes.
"

Noticed a significant improvement in my gum health and reduction in plaque. Well worth the investment for your health.
"
"
Multiple settings.My teeth are whiter, cleaner and my gum line is freshLovely case too!Love the cup charger option too
"

Love this toothbrush.  Makes teeth feel dentist clean everytime you use it.
"

Moved to this from a spin brush.  I didn't expect a significant difference, but was pleasantly surprised how much cleaner it gets my teeth.  The Android App also helps keep you brushing for the full amount of time, so you avoid rushing areas.

I purchased this toothbrush by 6 months ago, and it cannot recharger anymore right now. I have no clue that it’s toothbrush or charger’s quality problem. This is a so bad experience.
"
"
Why did it break down after only a few days? The teetbrush has no response when I press start, and no response when I put it in to the charging  base
"
"
This TB does such a great job my dental technician was wondering what I was doing differenly when I went in for my routine cleaning
"
"
Great cleaning product for your teeth. The best out there.
"
"
Great product, but no longer has a charging case.
"

The quality is good. But it cannot clean all the corner.

I bought 3 more for my whole familyBut you should really understand how to use it and brush the teeth so you don’t harm them
"
"
Battery problems after 30 days. Won’t charge properly.

This is not good value. Too expensive and need to change the brush in a few weeks. Only used a couple of months and dead.

Great toothbrush but the app is glitchy.  Sometimes it finds the toothbrush, mostly not.  When it does it often misses areas or says you did.

I bought this toothbrash for 4 months, and it started to have charging issue since this month. The power runs out much more faster than normal, and it cannot charge anymore. Terrible quality

I've used some pretty high-cost pieces of technology in the past and haven't always been left impressed, so I'm glad to say that I feel the cost of this brush is very fair when compared to other brushes on the market right now. Sonic brushes are the best you can get for your teeth right now and after using this, I can easily see why Sonicare is a leader of sonic brushes. That's not to say there isn't room for improvement, but the problems with this brush are very minor and not related to performance. Performance-wise, I have to admit that it's perfect. I usually use a regular electric brush, but have been lazy lately and using a manual, the difference in how clean my teeth feel after brushing with this is massive. It absolutely gets every bit of food or plaque.It's also really quiet, far more quiet than some of the electric brushes I've used. Since the sonic is quite forceful, but it's a higher pitch, it doesn't sound very loud at all. I feel comfortable using this late at night without worry.The charging glass is a really cool concept, but it has some flaws that could be worked out. If you have a sink mounted in a cabinet style and you already use a rinsing glass, this would be perfect for you. However, my bathroom layout is not as great, I have shelves near the sink, but not enough room for this charger by the sink where I use my toothbrush. I don't currently use a glass for this reason, so while the design and concept is really neat (and works great) it doesn't fit my bathroom layout at all.Which brings me to the two problems with this product (both minor and both related to the charging glass). One, the cord is far too short. My shelving unit is right next to the sink, on the right and my plug is on the left side of the sink. The cable wasn't long enough to stretch (about 1 and 1.4  length of a standard sink). This is an ongoing issue with Philips products that I wish they would fix. The second issue is cosmetic. While I love, love, love the sleek black toothbrush design, the cord on the charging glass is also black (only on black model). Nobody has a black bathroom. Overall, people definitely have white, or lighter coloured bathrooms, so why make the cord black? It stands out like a sore thumb and makes the bathroom look ugly and cluttered. This wouldn't be an issue with a cheap brush, but with the Sonicare standard, it's definitely something they could change to make it feel even better. Just a little change of a white cable would make a huge difference to how this product looks in a room.If they really wanted to go nuts with improvement, they could move the 'change setting' button further down. I often accidentally hit it when the app tells me to turn on the brush for a 'touch-up' and that can be a bit annoying. A pause button would be an improvement too as when using the app I often feel rushed to make sure I hit every tooth and don't have time to spit which inevitably can be a bit uncomfortable. I do really like how the brush and app tells you when you are using too much pressure or motion as it's really helped me make the change from a regular toothbrush to a sonic and make sure I'm cleaning correctly.I would definitely recommend this for the difference in brushing alone. All of the complaints I have are minor nitpicks that Philips could use to improve the product, but shouldn't stop you from buying this. I think it's absolutely worth it to take care of your teeth and have noticed a big difference in mine since I switched.

The toothbrush works as promised. It's fantastic! I stopped using the app because it shows you where to brush but doesn't include the backside of the front teeth nor the molars ( where the food gets chomped ). The brush shuts itself off after 3 minutes then the app says you missed the areas it didn't tell you to brush.... Do yourself a favour and save a bit of money. Don't go too techy when comes to brushing your teeth
"
"
Really like this product. Unfortunately, the base has stopped charging the Sonicare Toothbrush making it unusable.  Do not know how to contact seller or to order another chargering base to make the brush functional :(
"
"
Sent back.......very rough on my teeth.
"
"
i just used two month. And doesn’t work today. Is it has warranty of that?
"
"
Its amazing at cleaning teeth, the app provides helpful guidance, it looks and feels well built, the charger is pretty.
"

An otherwise awesome toothbrush is ruined by the stupidest charging station I've ever seen.

I love this toothbrush!  I've been using a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for years and in my opinion nothing compares to the cleaning performance.  So when I was given the opportunity to test the 9300 DiamondClean Smart, I jumped at the chance to give it a try, and I am very impressed.First off, it's so cool-looking.  It has a simple, attractive white design with only two buttons and a base that lights up.  Indicator lights on the toothbrush are invisible until they light up too, very nifty.  The charger is actually located in the base of a glass that you keep on your counter.  When you're finished brushing you just put the toothbrush in the glass and it begins to charge.  Very neat.  It comes with a very nice soft leather travel case.  The quality is amazing.This is a very easy to use and very user-friendly toothbrush.  Just install the app and follow the instructions on your mobile device.  The app enables some cool features to help you brush more effectively and keep track of your brushing habits.  It will even tell you in real time if you missed a spot.  The app also gives you tips to help you brush better.The toothbrush comes with 3 different heads to give you three different cleaning types.  There's a deep cleaning head, advanced gum care head for sensitive gums, and a stain remover head for deep stain removal.  And here's a really impressive feature... Each brush head contains an ID chip so the toothbrush recognizes each head and changes the vibration characteristics to suit each head.  And I find it really helpful that the toothbrush actually keeps track of individual brush head usage, letting you know when it's time to change heads, even if you use multiple heads.  Very smart!If you're new to the Sonicare system, it can take some getting used to the intense vibration of this cleaning system.  So to help newcomers, it has an easy-start feature that starts off with a lighter vibration and ramps up over a couple weeks to full power to help you get used to the sensation.  I think lots of people will appreciate this feature.  I deactivated this feature since I've been using the Sonicare system for years.Lastly, for peace of mind this toothbrush comes with a two-year warranty.So to conclude, this is one smart toothbrush that is sure to impress you as it did for me.  I think it's the best toothbrush on the market and I recommend it for anyone who likes technology and connected devices and wants a toothbrush that will keep your teeth cleaner than ever.

Ok, I've been using electric toothbrushes since the mid 90's.  Primarily sonic are, but also oral-b.  I've also had some dental issues in the past, so when it comes to oral hygiene I don't mind paying a premium for the next best thing if it's going to actually make a difference.  As a result, I've picked up a few extra electric tooth brushes and devices over the years.  That said – is it's ""actually going to make a difference?""  is a question that's been hanging in my mind for years. Are the current breed of high end toothbrush any better than their lower priced counterparts?  Is there a difference in performance, or are we just talking extra features, and do those extra features actually have any real world practical utility?  I've been wrestling with this every time I leave the dentist's office – perhaps I should get a newer brush, perhaps it will help, but every time  I look at these high end brushes I'm left with the impression that it's the same performance (~30,000 strokes, etc) throughout the sonicare range, etc. and the difference is just aesthetics and extra features that don't really make sense to me, and I've held off purchasing something new over the last 3 years.  So when the opportunity presented itself to test this brush I was very excited.  Unfortunately, my experiences with is suggest that my doubts were well founded.  Does it perform better than my lower end sonicare tooth brush? No, performance appears to be the same.  Do the extra features (pressure sensor) and app actually add any value – no, not really.  The app was a bit finicky connecting to my brush – had to turn it off, then put it on the charger, then take it out and turn it back on, to get it to connect.  The app also has a number of dental hygiene regiments that it will guide you through, but how many of us actually have the time to go through these? Certainly not me.  The app also provides you with a picture of your teeth and slowly guides you through the different stages of cleaning them, but we should all already know what the pattern, so not much value to that either.  Going through this several times, the only tip/reminder  I picked up out of it was to move the brush head slowly and let it do the work, don't move it too quickly back and forth otherwise the sensor indicates you're moving it too much.  At any rate, the app is really just a gimmick, but would likely only have real value to someone who doesn't really know how to brush their  teeth. While I expect there's a fair portion of the population that probably fits into this group, the fact that they don't, and have never sought out the correct way, would suggest they're not the type of person to pay attention to this app anyway but I digress.  So, was there any extra value to all the features? No not really. The only feature that has value, and is also available in the lower models, is the brushing quadrant timer, which helps you ensure you spend enough time on each quadrant.Aesthetically – this brush does have some additional value – it's slimmer and sleeker then some of the other models and the charging cup is a novel idea with some additional utility.  I find it goes quite well with our modern décor in our washroom, and looks much slicker then some of our other brushes.  In this regard, I only have one criticism, and that's that the brush does not stand straight when charging in the cup, it has to lie at an angle, which somewhat detracts from the aesthetics in my mind – creates a bit of a visual fauz pas to me.  I prefer  things to stand straight, not cockeyed.  Also, I note that this brush as a certain rattle to it that my lower end model doesn't exhibit – I haven't been able to actually pin point what's causing it, but might just be a minor defect with my brush.  It's not really an issue, just detracts from the feeling of quality in my mind.So if this brush for you? Perhaps if you needed the latest and greatest, or you want something that looks more aesthetically pleasing that a cheaper brush, but if you're just looking for a good clean, it can be accomplished with a lower model at a more reasonable price.  I kind of appreciate the upgrade in the aesthetics for something that I have to look at every day, and also appreciate that the charger/glass actually looks nice sitting on my glass shelf above my sink, as opposed to something that clearly looks like tooth brush charger, so in my mind it's actually filling a need above that of the base models, and as such would upgrade it from a 3 to 4 starts for that.  It's not going to get 5 stars because there really limited brushing value added over and above that of the lesser models.Lastly:  Mechanical Oral-B vs Sonicare – I've also researched this on and off for the last 10 years, and here's what I've concluded based on my research as well as my experiences using both.  If you spend the necessary time brushing your teeth the Oral-B will provide a slightly better clean, and I believe that independent testing has also born that out.  That said, it requires someone to take the necessary time and attention to the task to effect that outcome.  How many of actually stick to that regime? Probably less than 10% in my estimations.  My life is way too complicated, hetic and fast pace.  Do I spend 2 minutes + brushing my teath, or a full 4 minutes if you want to get a deep clean? No, I spend about 60-90 seconds depending on the day. Does oral-B clean better than a sonicare in 60-90 seconds – no, likely not, and you may actually get a better clean with the Sonicare in that time because the brush head is bigger and you'll likely cover off more area than you would with the Oral-B.  Not scientific, just my impressions.  Lastly, and most importantly, which brush to you like to uses more?  You'll likely use whatever appeals to you more, better than you would the other, which is one of the reasons I uses sonicare over the oral-b, despite being able to get a better clean with the latter.  I find it just seems to take me longer to cover off all my teeth with the Oral-B which has me reaching for my sonicare 4/5 times.  I still uses the oral-B 1-2 per week, just to switch up my dental hygiene, but if I had to choice one it would be the sonicare –that said you're preferences may differ. In this regard, I've been watching some of these new tooth brush systems coming out, and

First off: I’ve loved my sonicare when I first bought it 6 years ago. It would hold a charge forever and cleaned my teeth very well.However my old one finally died about 8 months ago so I purchased a new one then. It died in 3 months. Wouldn’t hold a charge. I thought “weird but ok” and bought a replacement.Then the replacement died in two months.I can’t keep replacing this product at such a high cost so I’ve gone back to old fashioned tooth brushes.Clearly there is a manufacturing problem and I’m not getting the product that is advertised.Move on to a different product, do t buy this one.

I have used to the rotary kind of electric toothbrush for years and I immediately liked the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Smart Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush for one important reason, both types of brushes do a good job of cleaning, massaging the gums and polishing the teeth but in my case at least, this Philips toothbrush does fantastic work of dislodging food stuck between my teeth.The Philips Sonicare app is very nice and since it uses SmartSensors inside the brush heads instead of the iPhone camera, it makes monitoring much friendlier and accurate. However, those same sensors make replacing the brushes more expensive.The charging base glass, to me, is cute at best. Sure it holds the toothbrush but is of no use to store the other brush heads. It is also impractical when travelling but the brush does hold its power for a long time, longer than my trips anyway. Philips advertises 2 weeks per charge. Speaking of travelling, the travel case only holds 2 brush heads, does NOT charge and I find it fairly bulky.SO to sum up, I love this brush but not the bells and whistles.

My wife and I have been using this for a few weeks now and here is what we found.- The overall design and build of this toothbrush is excellent, as with all Philips products. They appear strong and durable. We are impressed with the charging glass, and it is quite a unique design and idea. Looks like a regular rinsing glass but works differently. Whoever came up with this design needs a raise.- The set comes with three brush heads. The bristles in the brush heads are not too soft and not too hard. It is just right for us. However, the three brush heads are not the same. They have different purposes. Therefore, the brush and the brush heads aren't really designed for family use. It is designed for a single person's use. We have spare brush heads for the other Philip toothbrush we have used in the past, and we use those spare brush heads with this set, too.-  The brushing intensity can be changed. There are three intensity levels. The modes can also be changed. There are four modes. So, there is room for people to experiment and find the right intensity+mode combo that suits them. My wife's teeth and gum are a bit sensitive, so she chooses the low intensity and the simple ""clean"" mode. I sometimes go for the ""gum health"" and ""deep clean"" mode. However, since I also have dental fillings, I avoid the high intensity levels to avoid any damage to my fillings. So, these intensity+mode combo can be adjusted and refined according to need.- The battery lasts surprisingly for a long time. We charged it the day we received it, and did not have to charge it again for about a week. So, when fully charged, the battery lasts at least for 7-10 days easy, maybe more.- I am not a big fan of the bluetooth and app features in electric toothbrushes. I have found that they're not extremely useful from my previous experience using other Philips brushes with bluetooth features. However, that is only my personal opinion. Other people may find the feratures useful. For example, the app tracks the brush head use and lets us know if the brush heads need to be replaced. People may find that useful.

The world's most advanced smart toothbrush!First off the bluetooth connection to your phone is rock solid.  Once you download their app, it shows a photo of a mouth, top and bottom and begins to animate areas that you've been brushing currently on the screen.  If you've been neglecting that back left tooth, it will show you!  Other than that it also has an a timer, which all smart brushes do for how much time is left in your brushing as a reccomendation daily brush.  I beleive it's about 2 min.  While the count down is happening on the phone, it will alert you if you're pressing down too hard as it has pressure sensors in the brush.  It will also alert you when it's time to change the head based on data.The one draw back I found, was I couldn't figure out if the pressure sensors are in the head or the base.  Philips wants you to buy their special heads for 20 dollars each which have a technology called ""brushsync"" I'm which the brush head pairs with the base.  Not sure if it's an nfc protocol, or something much simpler. So while other companies offer cheaper compatible hheads for this model; I couldn't really tell if they'd fully work with such an advanced base as they lack brushsync technology.That being said, I believe that philips is making an attempt to flush out compatible brushes by offering this brushsync technology in the hope that you'll only buy their highly over priced brushes.  Becuase where smart brush companies make the money is not the base, it's the brush refills.  So for that reason even though it's the world's most advanced and sofisticated smart toothbrush, I've docked the review a full point.For our family, we standardized on oral B, with very cheap compatible brush heads from Amazon Canada prime.  It does the job way better than a manual toothbrush, for very cheap.This brush is an absolute technological marvel.  It makes brushing fun for all ages, gives you alerts, trends and reports, a long battery life, sleek and sexy and will complement any decore, you just need to research the heads a bit, before you commit.  Fanastic tooth brush experience!

There are a lot of things that I love about this elegant toothbrush, and not a lot that I didn't like!Allow me to start off by telling you about the things that I love about it. It is an elegant toothbrush, and well thought out. You charge the toothbrush by placing it in the included glass which rests on top of the charging base. No plugging it in to anything, no inconvenience. You just place it inside of the included glass and it charges effortlessly. The brush heads mimic a more traditional style of brush head and is not round, but rather oblong. My husband especially appreciates the clean that he gets with this brush and likes it better than his old electric toothbrush with the round brush head. A computer chip located inside of the brush head tells the toothbrush base which head it is, and adjusts brushing accordingly. These are all very thoughtful features and ones that I appreciate!There are only a few small things that I don't like about the brush. The brush heads are a little pricey at the current price as of this review of $15/per head. Granted, these don't need to be replaced all that often, but I like it when replacement is affordable. Also, I'm not sure what happens if the included glass breaks. Do you just use another glass for charging? Do you need to purchase a replacement glass? That's something that would have to be taken in to consideration if you have small children. The included travel case is a neat addition to the package, however the one that I got with my Oral B Electric Toothbrush allows the case to be plugged in to the wall while charging, while this one does not, meaning that you will need to bring your charging base as well as the glass on extended trips.Overall, however, this is a fantastic toothbrush with a lot of added features. The app is great, but the toothbrush can be used without the app if desired, or if you're trying to save space on your phone. I wasn't a huge fan of the app myself.

• The toothbrush looks and feels remarkable. The quality of the product is amazing and looks like a premium product. In the box, you get the tooth brush itself, 3 brush heads, a fancy wireless charging glass and a traveling case. The glass quality is also amazing. The traveling case made from soft leather looks great and feels great in your hand. However, this model does not charge through the carrying case. The brush has different brushing modes and intensity options. The brush does an outstanding job cleaning your teeth. You will start to see the results after a week. The brush also has pressure sensor built-in to tell you if you're brushing too hard. The battery life is good and the charging is fairly straight forward. The brush can be connected to Sonicare app to get additional features like your daily brush logs, areas your brushed and much more. I did use the app and didn’t have any issue connecting my brush with it. But personally, I found the app buggy and cluttered. The app needs to be redesigned with simplicity. Also, the connecting your brush should not require your phone location which is the strangest thing. You get 2-year warranty with additional option to extent for extra 6 months by registering your product. There are few downsides: the price of the product, replacements heads are prices are high, the app needs a lot of improvement. Overall, I recommended this product if you can spend the money.

Wow!  I love this toothbrush.The first thing I noticed was that the packaging was more environmentally friendly than I would have expected - rather than being full of styrofoam it was securely packaged inside a cardboard insert - fully recyclable.3 different brush heads are included - they are ""smart"" in that the toothbrush and the app recognize which one you have put on. The choices are:  deep clean, gum care and stain removal.Instead of the usual flat charging base, this unit has a glass that rests in a base and the toothbrush charges in the class Unusual....Although the app isn't necessary for most and I suspect I'll be too lazy to use it every time, I found it interesting and I can see for some people it would be extremely useful. When I was brushing I got messages such as reducing motion and that I needed to reduce pressure. It also highlights different areas of the mouth and tells you which area to brush when, so that you spend roughly the same amount of time on each area.This is probably the first time I've spent an entire 2 minutes brushing - the app definitely helped me to not get distracted and end early. And WOW does my mouth ever feel clean, really it feels as clean as it does after seeing the dentist!I like that, when done brushing, the app asks you if you flossed, if you cleaned your tongue and if you used mouthwash. Great reminders.All in all, while the app is a little gimmicky it's kind of cool at the same time and some will probably really enjoy that feature. Whether you choose to make use of the app or not it's a fantastic toothbrush that provides a phenomenal clean.Highly recommended!

It’s special brushing your thoot with that kind od a toothbrush i had like to try the competitor

I decided to keep this review short and sweet, as I have tested this product for a total of approximately 3 months now, and there is only so much I have to complain about this product. For more detailed reviews, there are more reviews on this product so I recommend you take a look at those.• PROS •+Comfortable design and solid construction+2 week battery life+3 spare brush heads included+Mobile application is excellent in tracking brush movement as well as pressure+2 year warranty (+6 months if you register in 30 days);+3 different sensitivity modes based on the brush you use;+Wireless charging with glass cup~ CONS ~-Slightly overpriced. Similar products withot wireless cup charging and/or mobile app integration go for much less-Expensive brush head replacements

Exceptional.This product is absolutely exceptional. The charging glass is so sleek and the design is amazing. It has an integrated mobile app that you can use to help determine if your brushing well, and what to improve or where you missed. A light up sensor tells you if you're pressing too hard, and it leaves an AMAZING clean. My dentist noticed a difference at my check up, and asked if I'd started brushing more because my teeth were much cleaner than normal (I've seen the same dentist for 6 years). I had an electronic tooth brush that was good quality, but this one really has changed my oral hygiene routine exponentially... and best is that I only have to brush for 2 minutes to have pearly white clean teeth!

This is hands down the best toothbrush I have ever used.It comes fully charged and ready to use. There are three heads included-whitening-plaque control-gum healthWhen you put the head on the base it automatically selects which option goes with which head, you can change the cleaning option to whatever you want as well. It comes with a charger that doubles as a rinsing cup and a travel case.You can connect to the app and it can guide you on how to brush your teeth. Also, you can input any cavities or areas you want to pay special attention to and it will highlight it for you ok the app when brushing your teeth.I don't use the app, I just use the toothbrush. The toothbrush buzzes when it has completed a section and it has a 2 minute timer built in also, the bottom lights up of you are pressing too hard on your teeth.This toothbrush is awesome, my teeth feel like I just had them cleaned at the dentist.

This thing is out of this world! By far the most advanced toothbrush I've owned (had a couple of Oral-B brushes before this one).The brushing mechanism it uses takes a little getting used to but it really does make your teeth feel very clean. The app is very useful and really just demonstrates how far toothbrushes have advanced - the brush and app can sense pressure, position, type of brush head, and the app even gives you goals that you can work to achieve.The brush itself is very sleek and feels comfortable to hold. It also comes with a nice travel case and a cool drinking glass that doubles as a charger.Highly recommended if you don't mind spending the $$$.

Great when it worked. Both mine and my wife's are broken after 2 years. The bearing on hers is loose to the point it's not functional. Mine just fails to turn on 80 prevent of the time. Expect to replace more frequently than your cell phone. Not worth the price.

I had been using cheap Oral B for 10 years and my dentist suggested to change brand name for this “super brush”. I couldn’t be more disappointed with it. It lost power strength after just one month of use and its intensity is weaker than the one of a disposable electric brush. Not recommended at all.
"
"
Worst toothbrush ever. This is the second one I’ve had after contacting Phillips
"
"
The toothbrush is great, but the app isn't accurate and tells you to go over the same area multiple times..
"
"
Believe  me no body will be sorry if you buy this toothbrush your mouth and teeth just feel brand new every time you brush been using sonicare  for four years now both one for my daughter  too
"
"
Expensive toothbrush thought it would last a lot longer. Died after 1 year of use.
"
"
Not a bad toothbrush it is a bit pricey but I think it is well worth it for the features that it has and that it comes with extra brush heads is nice as you and your spouse can just pack one toothbrush when traveling and or just have one brush in the bathroom and just switch heads and have less clutter on the bathroom counter. or keep all heads for your self and not have to buy more for awhile. the toothbrush itself has sensors to alert you when you are using to much pressure as well how you should hold it for optimal cleaning. the app is nice as it keeps track of your brushing habits and gives pointers and tells you when you need to replace your head so you do not have to worry and keep track of when it is time to replace the head. as well the sensors keep track of where you brush so it can tell if you missed a spot or if extra care is needed in other places (your problem areas) over all it is a nice brush I like it my husband loves it

In that case, not so good looking neither. I have used Philips Sonicare DiamondClean (not smart phone version) for 3 years and thought it is time to upgrade it. I bought it and automatically think it come with a charging travel case because if the old version has one, there is no reason for the upgraded version does not have one. I meant to change to philips 9700, but they only come with one colour, not my colour. Fortunately, the battery life is up to 14 days according to the package.And I DON'T THINK the charging station is stupid if you use the little plastic base to charge instead of the glass as I shown in the picture. The picture is the compare between two sonicare diamond toothbrushes.It's a great toothbrush brushing wise.

After my last electric toothbrush died I did some research to find the 'best' electric toothbrush out there and stumbled across the Philips DiamondClean. This toothbrush is amazing! Out of all the previous electric toothbrushes I've used this one has got a LOT of power and it feels like I just left the dentist after a cleaning! You'll notice that you'll have to clean your mirror more as toothpaste is easily splattered around with the power of the toothbrush (perhaps its a brushing error though).I tried the bluetooth app on my iPhone for a few brushes but didn't see the benefit for me. The toothbrush comes with 3 separate brush heads depending on the type of clean you're looking for but I have only used the standard 'clean' head so far.The black color paired with the LED lights, charger, and soft feel of this toothbrush definitely set it apart from the other toothbrushes in our bathroom (and any other toothbrush I've ever used). The charger is amazing too! It comes with a heavy glass that can be used to charge the toothbrush but I preferred the small charger instead...it's great because it takes up very little space compared to other electric toothbrush chargers and can easily be cleaned (unlike other chargers).This toothbrush was a bit on the pricey side but I think it's worth every penny! I'm looking forward to my next dentist checkup to see if they notice any improvements to my oral health.

This is the 4th Sonicare toothbrush I bought and Sonicare is still the best electric toothbrush I have ever used. The first one lasted a very long time. Both the 2nd and 3rd ones failed under 2 years of using them and they all died of the same problem. I particularly like this one for the rinsing-glass charger and the new pressure sensor. I paired the toothbrush with the app without any issues and that took no more than 5 minutes. I haven’t really tried the app yet. Overall, I am very pleased with the toothbrush. The seller shipped very quickly and the item was sealed and brand new. The only downside is, of course, the cost of replacing the brush heads. They are pretty pricey.
"
"
This is my third Phillips Sonic Care Toothbrush I have bought.  I am so disappointed in this model which was the most expensive one I bought and was suppose to be the best one.  It does not clean my teeth like my other one and every time I brush it stalls and I am not using any pressure.  The charge lasts a week at most, where my last one always lasted two weeks.  I would not recommend buying this model at all.  In fact I am going to buy a different brand and just throw this away.
"
"
I finally gave it a try from recommendations from my friends and dental hygienist. It's a great brush with multifunctionality. It took about 2 weeks to switch 100% from a traditional toothbrush. Battery lasts about 3 weeks and the charging station is pretty cool. The travel case could be better if it had a latch; the model I have is relying on a magnet.The app is smart, GUI can be better but I think it needs more love but that may just be me being nit picky.As this is a pretty hefty ticket item I would have switched earlier had I tried it in the past which is not very easy.
"
"
This product actually got 2 stars because for the short time that it worked it was quite effective.  If possible I would have given zero stars.This is a peculiar design with the glass charging jar  I could live with that, but I purchased this toothbrush in June.  By mid-august (just after the 30-day return date) it completely failed to vibrate.  Total electric toothbrush fail.There was a problem with the way I set up the charging glass.  Spoke with customer service and they were very helpful.  The toothbrush is working great.  It gets 4 stars not 5 because the charging glass set up is a little weird, but it's effective.  The apps are of no use.  There's no way I want my toothbrush connected to my computer.  However, it's a good toothbrush and it's working now!
"
"
Great tooth brush, it’s a little weird getting used to not scrubbing as much but it leaves a much cleaner feel in my month. I like the different modes and intensities. Using with the app is great and gives you a better idea of how evenly you brush your teeth and even prompts you to brush a little longer if it detects an area that was neglected. My only wish is that the travel case it comes with acted as a charger similar to the non Bluetooth brush.
"
"
I’ve been using the 20$ oral B electric toothbrush for almost a year until my hygienist recommended Sonicare. I’ve heard a lot about the diamondclean and decided to give it a try. Let me tell you that you’ll need some time to get used to the tickling and the strong brushing sensation of this toothbrush, but the teeth will feel and look super clean afterwards. In my opinion it’s kinda expensive because I personally don’t use the app and some of the added features but if it’s gonna reduce my dental bills then it’s worth it. The app is good but not very accurate.
"
"
Not worth paying full price but if you can get it when on sale then it’s an awesome toothbrush. Battery lasts weeks but less than previous version. Travel case does not charge the toothbrush like the previous version. Smart features are useful but ultimately I use them rarely and just brush and go.
"
"
Has a lot of settings so that you can deep clean or get a sensitive clean.  Have been using it on the Gum Health and my teeth feel way cleaner after every brush compared to my old Oral B electric brush.  I think the replacement heads will be a be more costly but so far well worth it.
"
"
The charge station doesn't work after 3 month, so I can't charge the battery at all now.
"
"
So much better than my previous electricToothbrush. It is a a gentle movement, once you start using it and if you go back to the old toothbrush you will notice a significant difference.
"
"
You won't regret this. It's an amazing device. Every other toothbrush truly pales in comparison.
"
"
I get compliments from my dentist all the time.
"
"
Great evolution of the model. Gives even more feedback about the quality of brushing. Helps develop better brushing habits.
"
"
great product and the pink is so cheeky
"
"
It has taken a bit to connect to the app but now that they are working together it is great.  Phillips needs to check the app to make it more accessible  to different programs
"
"
This product is great! It feels like getting a professional dentist cleaning everyday. It will take a week to get past the tickling sensation while you’re brushing, but it’ll pass.
"
"
I like the feeling when brushing my teeth hee hee.
"
"
Perfect as described, recommended by my dentist.  You can also watch video's on utube on how to use this brush.
"
"
Noticed my teeth were feeling cleaner after the upgrade, well worth the cost
"
"
This is an excellent brush. But not sure the app is worthwhile.
"
"
Excellent quality, the app is very nice to work with, would recommend
"
"
Great
"
"
Arrived in perfect condition in original box no dents or scrapes. Fast delivery
"
"
Great upgrade from a manual brush, should of done this a long time ago!
"
"
Dropped my first one on ceramic floor and and bought another one immediately. I can't ever go back to a manual toothbrush.
"
"
Great product. I recommend it.
"
"
Amazing toothbrush. 10/10 was worth the money. I lick my teeth everyday and it feels like when i leave the dentists office.
"
"
Excellent produit, silencieux
"
"
Best toothbrush I ever used never felt my teeth cleaner before
"
"
Yes but my glass was broken and waiting on a replacement from Philips
"
"
good stuff
"
"
Got this for my mother and she is in love with it!
"
"
great!
"
"
good clean, happy with it.
"
"
I love this!!
"
"
Love it
"
"
This toothbrush does not come with a travel charging case and you cannot buy just the charging case and the charging cases from previous generations of Philips Sonicare DiamondClean don't work with this toothbrush!!! If I could return it I would but I threw away the packaging.
"
"
What can I say Phillips makes the best electric toothbrush around. Love the color pink as I work in breast cancer and pink is the new black. Highly recommended!!
"
"
Great product with a high quality! Don’t hesitate to buy it if you need one new electronic toothbrush.
"
"
Worth the money!

Having received this toothbrush in September, I used it for a month and gave it a positive review. It worked great, provided an excellent clean, comes with nice accessories, etc. It has been 3 months and my toothbrush no longer holds it charge, I can't get more than 5 uses out of it before it dies. I've cleaned the toothbrush thoroughly, incase there was any build up jamming the button, but it has not helped; however, if this was the cause, it would be an incredibly annoying design flaw.I'm fortunate to have received this toothbrush free to review, if I hadn't I'd be very angry. For now, I'm returning to my trusty, inexpensive, Oral B Pro.

I have always loved to brush my teeth 3+ times per day but after I was told my gums are starting to recede I have been nervous to use an electric brush. Our dentist has always recommended Sonicare for the kids with braces, so we have been using Sonicare as well for a few years. We are so happy they have come up with this option, so we can track our oral care including gums.  The toothbrush handle provides excessive pressure feedback via a light on the base and vibration, so you don't really need to use the app unless you want to track things more closely (i.e., moving handle too fast, quadrants completed, tongue scraping, flossing, etc.).  My teeth are most definitely cleaner after brushing with this Sonicare.Pros:- rechargeable- includes black smart handle, 3 brush heads (plaque control, gum care and premium white), travel case, charging glass and App- 90-day money-back guarantee- 2-year warranty- track your dental hygiene- claims it removes 10x more plaque and makes teeth noticeably whiter in < 1 wk- smart sensors provide pressure & movement feedback- location sensors know when you have missed a spot, so you can add more brushing time to address- Smart brush head recognition can personalize you brushing goals- 4 different modes and 3 intensity settings- travel case included (holds 2 brush heads)Cons:- price is a bit steep (toothbrush & replacement brush heads)- some may find the app gimmicky- travel case does not lock shutDesign / Functionality - 10/10Quality / Construction - 10/10Value - 9/10 (Price at time of review - $189.99)Please see photos below for more information.Recommendation:  BUY (if you are OK to spend the $ for the cleanest teeth ever!)I hope you found this review helpful in making your purchase decision. If so, please select the yes button below this review.Paul

This toothbrush looks and feels impressive. It comes with a extremely fancy charging system. There's a nice glass that you can place on top of the charging base and by just placing your toothbrush inside will charge it. The travel case is also very nice and allows you to bring along two different heads. This system itself comes with three different brush heads. On the downside when it comes time to replace them they are priced higher than what I expected.As far as how it works I'm not completely sure how many stars to rate it. The toothbrush itself definitely works and works well. My teeth feel a lot cleaner after using this toothbrush versus other ones I'm use to using. I'm not even a fan of sonic toothbrushes. This is the first one I haven't minded using. However, I wasn't really sold on the app. It will tell you what areas you should touch up, to reduce pressure, and a few other things but it didn't impress me enough that I'll want to use the app every single time I brush my teeth. This is more of a personal opinion or preference as I feel like it's a slight inconvenience and would rather just take the time to do a good job than rely on watching my smart phone while I brush or after. I think the app would be better suited for my son. To just to make sure he's getting all his teeth and not just trying to get the job done as fast as possible.Overall, I think this toothbrush could live up to all it's claims. Such as, removing 10x more plaque and whitens up to one shade in less than a week. There's no denying that it does a good job. I however wouldn't personally want to purchase it based solely on it's app.

I am someone that is pretty much completely immersed in technology, when the opportunity came up to try out this toothbrush I figured why not upgrade from the manual kind that I have used forever in order to get a better clean and plenty of smart features. As an electric toothbrush it is great, as a ""smart brush"", not so much.No matter what I tried, I could not get the app to work on an Android device. I have tried two separate devices (Samsung S8 and LG V20) with no luck. I was able to get the app working on my girlfriend's iPhone, but needless to say I'm not going to get her phone every time I go to brush my teeth. The app was impressive at first, but I am unconvinced at its accuracy, despite its fancy stats and coaching that it displays. I was encouraged as I received an update to the app last week, but no change.Onto the good news, I've noticed a big change compared to my manual brush. My mouth simply feels a lot more clean. Not quite dentist clean, but about as close as you can get, I was definitely impressed. The build definitely feels premium, and I'm glad it comes with replacement heads. The included glass and wireless charger is truly genius as once I'm finished I toss it into the glass just as I would my manual brush and it begins charging. I have no experienced a ""dead"" toothbrush yet because of this. As much as I love tech, plugging in a toothbrush might seem a bit odd. Tech should be adapting to our uses and this is a great example of this.Overall, I was impressed with the toothbrush as a toothbrush, especially its charging abilities. I was severely disappointed that I cannot use the app properly and this may not be such a huge deal however you are paying for premium quality, and an app that may or may not function is disappointing. If you weren't looking for something that is smart then you are in luck, if you are and an Android user, you may want to look elsewhere.

This toothbrush is a bit bonkers. I personally would never spend $250 on a toothbrush, as there are other things I would prioritize before this. That being said: I received this for free from Amazon to review, so Here is my 100% honest review!At first, I was a bit skeptical about this product, especially since I've never used an electric toothbrush before. It was a bit weird at first, I felt like my brain was vibrating. But by the second time using it, I was already liking it.As a tea drinker, my teeth are stained. Within a couple of times of using this toothbrush, I noticed a huge difference in my teeth! They look, and feel, significantly cleaner than they did before. I like that there are different brushes to choose from, as well as different settings on the brush, depending on what you want/need. I've mostly used the 'clean' option and that definitely seems to do the trick!Where this toothbrush goes from ""electric"" to ""CLASSY"" is the glass, Glass Charging station. The glass Doubles as a rinsing class too and just dry it before putting the brush in. It comes with a nice travel case, and according to the box, one charge is good for 14 days!.Once I got the app figured out on my phone, it was pretty cool to see where I needed to brush again. It was a bit confusing to set up the app (probably because I'm not tech savvy), but once it worked it was great!Even without the App, this toothbrush is quite intelligent. If you linger on one spot too long, it changes the vibration of the brush so it kind of ""beeps"" in your mouth (its barely noticeable to anyone else, but loud and clear for the brusher) to remind you to move on. The 3 strengths are a nice feature as well.I also have the habit of brushing too hard - This brush has a sensor in it that lets you know if you're overdoing it. Pretty neat! Its cut down on my bleeding after brushing.Is this a $250 dollar toothbrush? Yes. Is it worth $250? For what it does for ME... not really. What it accomplishes can be done if you double or triple your brushing time with a 2 dollar toothbrush. However - If you're looking for a quiet (really quiet!) toothbrush that can cut your cleaning time down, and tracks your brushing habits (including HOW you brush) this is pretty much the bees knees and I would recommend it.The only 'complaint' (other than the price) I have is the amount of spit that goes flying out of your mouth while using the brush if you're not careful. Also, if your brush isn't deep in your sink when you rinse it off (while on) you'll get water spraying everywhere. Its pretty powerful!Would recommend to someone who is willing to spend hundreds of dollars on a toothbrush. It doesn't get any better than this. I'd say its pretty on par with a dentist cleaning!

There are a lot of things to like about the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean, but I just can't get past the price. I can get pretty much the same result from my $30 Sonicare Essence, just without the app, which frankly, as other people have mentioned, isn't particularly useful. It shows real time info on what areas to brush, but since the brush itself buzzes to tell you when to switch areas, that's unnecessary, and it tells you when to replace your brush head, but that's indicated by the color of the bristles anyway.I do like the aesthetics of the brush and the charger, they both look really cool! I just wish you could pick this unit up for a lower price, even $150 would be more reasonable in my opinion. It does a great job of cleaning your teeth, but so does my much less expensive Sonicare Essence. I just can't recommend this brush at this price point.
"

I bought two of these (older model) Nov 2014. One works perfect, as expected for a $200 toothbrush. The other one for very loose on the top and is now insanely loud and doesn’t do the job it once did.I asked Philips live chat how to go about getting a repair, they told me to buy a new one because they have no repair centres for these.So these are great when they work, but if it ever malfunctions be prepared to fork out another $200.I expected to use this for many years which is why I paid the price. Not thrilled
"
"
If you find the unit getting noisy .....contact customer care immediately.Limited use of my sonicare brush the shaft wore out and became loud enough to cause hearing loss!!Functionality of the brush is very good. Just be aware that the mechanical device will wear out and has a finite life. Just so happens my brush was not used immediately and sat in a drawer for a while. Now its garbage and out of the 24 mth window.
"

I never thought I'd live in a world where people are willing to spend over $200 on their toothbrushes, but here I am.  My partner and I have been using various electric toothbrushes for many years.  This is probably the highest end toothbrush on the market and here's my opinion:The build quality is exceptional.  The charging station is very well designed, having a glass that slots onto the charger, allowing the toothbrush to be chucked into the glass and charging to happen through the base of the glass - smart because it means any drips go into the glass, not onto the counter-top.  Battery life is superb.  This is not a charge every day toothbrush - more like charge every week.The vibration is extremely fast and the 3 intensity settings allow for a very comfortable choice that's down to personal taste.  I like it on the middle setting.  My teeth feel like glass after use and I think this tooth brush is better than my previous lowest end Sonicare brush and my 3 other Philips electric toothbrushes because of the more powerful motor, adjustable intensity settings and longer battery life.There is some amazing location recognition technology in this brush that at first I was skeptical of.  Can it really tell whereabouts in my mouth the head is?  Can it really tell the difference between when I'm brushing my upper right inside and my lower right inside?  The answer is yes.  The app shows me exactly which teeth I'm brushing and when I try to trick it, it still knows what I'm doing.  So this impressed me.  It is super useful?  I'll get into that later.I do have some criticism.  I think that the features on this brush that Philips use to justify the ultra high price are mostly gimmicks.  The different modes; clean, white, gum care and deep clean are surely gimmicks.  Yes, they do vibrate slightly differently or more or less intensely, but does that really mean the difference between cleaning and whitening?  I highly doubt it.The app was fun the first two times but I quickly got tired of having to turn on Bluetooth and connect my toothbrush to the app (which fails to connect sometimes) just to brush my teeth when it's 11.23pm and I just want to get to bed.  It feels a little too much for me.  I just want to brush my teeth.Another gripe I have with the whole 'brush how the app tells you to"" thing is that I feel rushed.  The app and toothbrush give you exactly 20 seconds to clean each section of your mouth before going onto the next section.  And the brush powers off after 2 minutes, no matter what!  This is not long enough for me.  I feel under pressure.  And I have to follow the pattern the app tells me to, despite having my own pattern I have followed for years.  This was my girlfriend's biggest issue with the app too - that you cannot program your own preferred cleaning pattern, you must always clean the teeth in the order it instructs.Is this a great toothbrush?  Yes.Does it do a better job of cleaning than their $80 Sonicare toothbrush?  No.Is the bluetooth and app stuff worth paying over $200? No, the novelty wears off quickly and the app becomes a hassle.Does having different modes like whitening/deep clean/gum health actually make your teeth any whiter/cleaner/healthier? No, it's a gimmick.This is a very good electric toothbrush with some very clever but basically useless features added to hype the price up to $210.  I'm still giving it 4 stars because I really like it, but I strongly believe it's not worth the price.  I recommend getting the lower priced Sonicare models without the bluetooth features and save a lot of money.

This is the most sophisticated toothbrush I have tried so far and I am truly satisfied of what it has to offer.First thing first, I have tried using the free app that you can use while brushing on the first week. But honestly it is a bit annoying to open the app twice a day (especially in the morning when I'm in a hurry). The app is truly amazing and it gives you ton of stats to keep you motivated. It also gives you warning if you are brushing too hard, too quickly, too much movements etc... I recommend using the app only on the first few days to help you understand the kind of pressure, speed and ways you can brush around your mouth.It is crazy how my mouth simply feels a lot more cleaner than using manual brushing. It almost feels like a dentist clean feeling, truly impressive. The toothbrush itself looks and feels amazing in your hand, not too heavy. The buttons don't need lots of pressure to be pressed. It comes with replacement heads. Each heads are meant for different kind of cleaning, once you install them on the shaft it connects wirelessly to the toothbrush handle to detect the brushing style needed (but you can choose your own preference). The included glass and wireless charger is amazing. It looks artistic and doesn't take much space. You just need to toss the toothbrush in the glass after brushing and it automatically start charging wirelessly. No need to plug the toothbrush anywhere (PS:The glass is plugged in a small wire setting).There is 4 different cleaning settings on the toothbrush (Clean, White, Gum Health, Deep clean). Personally I only use the Gum Health setting, it is the setting which makes my brushing feel the most clean, and gum health is far more important than the color of you teeth. There is also 3 speed setting for the brush, Low, Medium and Fast. Try using the low setting at first (you gum may bleed at first using the fast setting). Once your mouth gets use to the speed you can slowly go faster.Also, while brushing the brush makes a vibrating sound each 15 seconds which means you have to change the position of the brushing. Depending on the setting you are using the toothbrush will work from 2 to 3 minutes.In conclusion, this is a very impressive toothbrush, truly the most innovative toothbrush as of yet. The main highlight is probably it's charging ability using a glass which is incredible. The battery life easily lasts me for more than 1 week without charging. a small light flashes when you need to change the brush. It has pretty much everything a brush could ask for. It's also good to point out that I always brush my teeth in the shower and it seems this toothbrush is waterproof (BUT please note it does not say it is waterproof in the manual).Only small negative comment is that the toothbrush doesn't have a ""stand"" when you put in on the table. What I mean is if you put it length wise on the counter it keeps rolling on it's side, which is annoying when you apply toothpaste.I truly recommend this toothbrush to everyone who are serious about their teeth health (and have the money for it).

Was really debating between this and the Oral-B. I went with the this one due to all the brush heads I received with it along with the app and I loved the color. My mouth feels much cleaner compared to using my old oral-B . It's very nicely made, pretty to look at, simple to use, and most importantly cleans exceptionally.The toothbrush is presented and packaged like fine jewelry, and indeed it almost feels like a piece of fine jewelry in the hand. The entire toothbrush handle is covered in a soft but grippy finish. The handle is done is a deep midnight blue with gold accents. It is truly beautiful, if a toothbrush can truly be such a thing. The included charging glass is interesting. I'm not sure that it's any better than a regular charging base, but it does make a statement. Moreover, I noticed that the glass will also charge lesser model Sonicares. Speaking of charging things, the included fake leather travel case will also charge your toothbrush while you travel via USB. Included with the toothbrush are a plethora of special heads meant to whiten, massage gums, etc. I'm not sure that the different heads make any real difference, but if nothing else you won't have to buy toothbrush heads for a while.Cleaning performance of the Sonicare is amazing. If you've never used a power toothbrush before the Sonicare will be revolutionary. It leaves my teeth feeling squeaky clean, free of stains, my breath fresh, and helps my dental appointments to be mostly trouble free. The small oblong toothbrush heads are easy to maneuver around my mouth, and the high speed vibrations that the Sonicare creates feel invigorating to my gums. If this is the first time you are using a power toothbrush you may experience some sensitivity and/or bleeding, but it should go away in a few of days as your mouth adjusts.This newest version has an Android or iOS app and BLUETOOTH. It can keep track of your dental hygiene and coach you and remind you on your phone. This is kind of a gimmick but it could be enough to encourage you to better dental care. Also, the app always crashes when I start up my phone.

I've had an opportunity to use a number of toothbrushes from both Philips and Braun which span the full range of low to high end models. The Philips Sonicare Diamond Cleean smart tooth brush is Philips top end tooth brush. It comes with beautiful pleather bound case, with 3 tooth brush heads, the tooth brush body, and charging dock which also doubles as a cup for water.Everything included is well built and feels solid in the hand - no concerns about longevity here. In particular, I was really happy with the case design - the soft pleather covering gives this a super premium feel, and the hinge feels much more robust, especially when compared to the ""disposable"" hinge design on the braun travel case I have.The tooth brush charges by sitting in the water cup, which sits on top of the actual charging base. This makes for a very sleek looking design, though some may complain that the tooth brush doesn't feel secure while charging since it's just sort of sitting in the cup. Not a problem for me though. The included tooth brush heads are all different actually, with different shapes and varying levels of bristle hardness. Each tooth brush head is actually associated with a particular tooth brush mode (e.g. whitening or sensitive teeth) which modulates the rate and power of vibration of the tooth brush handle. The tooth brush heads actually have NFC chips built in which will interact with the tooth brush and automatically set it to the corresponding teeth brushing mode - definitely reflective of a well though out and convenient design, though I still find helpfulness of the different teeth brushing modes to be somewhat dubious. The actual teeth brushing experience itself is quite good. The handle provides more than enough power, and you're left with a fresh feeling in the mouth. Battery life is good too, lasting me for a 3-4 day trip without any problems.Some things I didn't enjoy so much - #1, the pressure sensor which indicates brushing too hard is at the bottom of the tooth brush handle and flashes purple, which is a lot harder to see than the bright red at the top of the braun tooth brushes. #2 - I personally find the teeth brushing apps to not be very helpful. I was able to connect mine without any problems, but I never look back at the data, and don't want to bring my phone into the shower with me to be able to see how long I've been brushing my teeth for. I'd much prefer a separate clock module that ties to the tooth brush, though these have largely been phased out.Overall I've been quite happy with this toothbrush. Very powerful with some thoughtfully designed accessories.

INITIAL IMPRESSIONIt took me a while to get used to the different “sonic” vibration of this electric toothbrush.(I’ve been previously using another brand of electric toothbrush.)From the moment that you turn it on you can instantly tell that it’s different than any other electric toothbrush you’ve used in the past.When I first turned it on, my initial reaction was, “Oh no.” because it reminded me too much of sitting in a dentists chair and the dreaded anticipation of waiting for that vibrating dentistry tools to be used on me. Lol!However I fought through that and gave it a go. It of course wasn’t bad at all, but does take some time to get use to. (The vibration is just different than my current electric toothbrush.)I quickly have come to prefer this Sonicare vibration over my previous electric brush.CLEANINGI brush my teeth with a mixture of baking soda and sea salt. (Just get the brush head wet and dip it into a little container of the mixture. It’s seriously great stuff by the way, and I wish I had started using it decades ago instead of just years ago.)The toothbrush feels fine in my mouth. (The unit is a little longer than my other electric toothbrush but it’s not a problem at all.)It comes with 3 styles of toothbrush heads.1. Premium Plaque Control  2. Premium Gum Care  3. Premium WhiteAnd there are 4 modes of cleaning options on the toothbrush.1. Clean  2. White+  3. Deep Clean+  4. Gum HealthI’ve been using mainly the “CLEAN” option on the toothbrush and that’s been working fine for me. (I have started on the lower vibration setting to start, but will likely increase the vibration as I get used to it.)And I really do like the fact that these better electric toothbrushes stutter the vibration to let you know when to switch to another section of your mouth. (Philips typically suggests splitting your mouth sections into 6, which I find makes more sense actually than Oral B's 4, and so a 2 minute brushing session is 6 - 20 second segments.)To make the most of this toothbrush, you really need to follow the instructions for the different heads, and modes in the instruction manual, or the app.CHARGINGNow for the charging system. As cool, new, and slick as it is, (I would LOVE this technology for my 1 1/2 yr old iPhone, Lol), for my toothbrush it’s a bit of a pain.I prefer to keep a clear bathroom counter. I don’t want things left plugged in and off to the side. (The clutter never ends otherwise.)I’m not a big neat freak everywhere in my home, but my bathroom counter is one thing I really make an effort to keep clutter free.I prefer to have a simple charger that I just pull out every 2 weeks as needed, instead of being left on the counter.This has a long-lasting lithium ion battery, which is fantastic, but this means that it DOESN’T need to be left charging all the time. (It doesn’t matter either way with lithium batteries, so no harm if you do though.)So, this fancy, smart charging system (you just toss the toothbrush in the glass, which rests on the charging base, and leave it there overnight), is actually a problem for me as I want/need to find space to store it safely out of the way, except for the 2 nights a month that I need to pull it out for charging.It definitely is GREAT that it keeps a charge for 14 days though, my other one was only good for around 5 days.THE SONICARE APPIt also comes with bluetooth technology within the toothbrush to work with an app on your smart phone that will give you real-time feedback as you’re brushing.“The location sensor shows you where you’ve brushed, and where you’ve missed. And if you start scrubbing, the scrubbing sensor reminds you to let the brush do the work.""It is handy to let you know if you’ve missed a spot, however long gone are the days that I’m looking for new software to add to my already app-bloated cell-phone.If you’re a dental health nut and this appeals to you, then you might love it. (Different strokes, right?)But for me, new software has to improve my life significantly before I consider committing another app to my already too-short life.WHITENINGAs far as the claim to “Whiten up to 1 shade in less than a week”, I’m going to have to say that this toothbrush alone does not do this.(I know it says this is when used in “Whiten” mode AND compared to a manual toothbrush.) This is a hard statement to confirm. This toothbrush is good, but I’m going to say not that good.My teeth definitely do feel clean and polished when done though.THE TOOTHBRUSHThis unit is solid and seems very well-made, despite being made in China, so Philips has likely monitored it’s quality control over there closely.Everything feels good in your hand, including the case, the charging base and glass stand. (And the toothbrush of course. Lol)It’s well-designed, however some of the designs don’t necessarily work out well for me. (As previously mentioned, the charging base mainly. I only need to charge this twice a month, so I don’t want to leave the fancy glass base on my bathroom counter all the time.)$$$However if you’re ready to drop $213.47 (at the time of this review) on an electric toothbrush, and WANT all these features, then you’ll likely be pleased. Or maybe you’re trying to impress somebody with an over-the-top toothbrush as a gift. Either way, it’s well made and lovely.So, even though I wouldn’t be able to justify the expense personally, I’ll still give it 4 stars anyway for quality and attention to detail. Also, I like the fact that the lithium ion battery lasts 2 weeks, instead of 5-7 days. That convenience is actually important to me.FYI. Replacement heads run for about $17 each. I believe they should last a few months each, at which time a brush head icon on the handle will light up reminding you to spend more money.

My first experience with smart toothbrushes left me a bit jaded - they just weren't actually very smart and did not do anything substantial to justify their price tag at all. This toothbrush changes that.The smart functionality is, in short, fantastic. The main feature that visually shows the areas that you have brushed and areas that have been missed. Using the app, it has brought attention to the fact that I habitually breeze through some areas and need to slow down and focus on them. The toothbrush is also able to indicate when too much pressure is being used and tells you to lay off the pressure (this is pretty standard in any entry level smart toothbrush though)The brush heads are very good, as is typical for the Soniccare line. I find that the head is slim & narrow compared to the other brand and am able to navigate it easily to clean teeth further back with relative ease. As a side note, I've tried a ton of third party brush heads for my old diamondclean brush... don't bother, they suck - just wait for a sale and stock up.The charging glass is a neat design and kinda similar to the ones included in prior soniccare models. Although I did not have this problem with this particular unit, the design is similar enough to note that you will want to carefully wash your toothbrush handle and dry it before placing it on the charging cup. That, and you'll want to rinse the cup carefully before use. I love the idea, but when it comes down to it, it can become a breeding ground for the nasties.Although the battery life on this toothbrush is excellent, it is disappointing that there is no convenient method of charging this toothbrush on vacation... not that anyone else addresses this outside of Phillips' even higher priced model. It's a $250 toothbrush, for that price, Phillips really should have thrown in a portable charger powered by USB or the USB travel case.

We have had the older version of the Sonicare Diamond Clean for quite some time and have been very happy with it. This new ""smart"" version is an update of that brush, adding ""smart brushing heads"" and an app that tracks your brushing habits and acts as a timer. Location sensors in the head make sure that you don't miss any area of your mouth (which is kind of handy), but that also means that the replacement heads are quite expensive.The DiamondClean is a very good brush. I like that it has several different levels of vibration (I prefer low intensity Clean mode due to TMJ issues, but to be honest I still find it vibrates my head a bit too much). My husband uses it on the standard setting and says his teeth feel great all day. The brush is quiet when in use, but I find it much to loud to use if someone is sleeping near by (perhaps I am just to sensitive to sound). The noise is high pitched and a little bit grating to my ears.I love how the brush charges--it comes with a cup that sits on a base. Just pop your brush in the cup and it charges up! It looks much nicer on the counter-top than normal electric brush chargers. You can use the cup to rinse your mouth, but we don't because we are afraid we might drop it and break it.Included in the package is three smart brush heads (whitening, gum care, and plaque control). Each one signals the handle to turn on to a different mode.There is also a travel case but unfortunately in this model it does not also act as a charger. However, the handle will hold a charge for about 2 weeks (although Philips claims 3 weeks), which is long enough for most vacations.The app is good but not amazing. To be honest, I used it the first few days for the novelty value--it is interesting to watch it the advice that pops up and how it tracks around--after that I just sort of forgot to load the app.Overall, this is an impressive brush that really does get your teeth super clean. The app is interesting if you want to see how good of a job you are doing on a daily basis, but at the same time I didn't find it overly helpful.

The Philips Sonicare 9300 Diamond Clean Smart tooth brush is an interesting product. Maybe it is for the person who must have the latest gadget, not just the latest  but a smart gadget at that! Oh it even works on Bluetooth - how appropriate is that? I guess for the list price of $249.95 (plus tax so in Ontario, add another 13% for a whopping $282.44) what one can expect? How about a smartphone to control it. Because you will need one to set up.In my case I was lucky to get one for free to review the Philips Sonicare 9300 Diamond Clean Smart tooth brush, so in my case the price was right. So if you can afford to get one, after using it for 3 weeks, I can say it is worth the price. The brush cleans very well and my teeth are whiter, and my gums are healthier, it even senses when I overbrush an area. A friend of my, who is very frugal to say the least, bought one on sale a month ago at his local drugstore and with his senior discount ended up paying $150 for it, almost at half price, Now he is considering buying one for his daughter too. Thus it is not just my opinion, that this is a great tooth brush and worth the expense if you can afford it. However, not everyone can, and it comes down to economics and the over all operating costs, you will need to replace the brush heads, and they not exactly cheap.Setting up the tooth brush  with the phone application can be a challenge and the questions comes down to do you truly need to see on your phone where to brush more? What is next GPS to your cavities? Maybe for an extra $300 they can make one that automatically fills your cavities too?While this is a great product it is  however, very pricey thus one star off, if you can afford it you will be happy with it if you like electric toothbrushes.

I'm not sure how anyone can write an honest review of a toothbrush without using it for a couple months, then visit the dentist, and then report back here to write a review.So more or less this is a placeholder until I visit my dentist in the middle of October. I will edit this post at that time to report on how well this device actually works.I'm fussy about my teeth. I visit my dentist at least 3 times a year, sometimes 4. I like my teeth to sparkly and I absolutely hate having gungy feeling teeth.Why am I like this? Because in my youth I neglected my teeth. When I became an adult I saw the light. I have a small fortune invested in my teeth, so I take care of them.Getting back to this toothbrush----I can really feel where they get the term ""sonicare"" from. If you can somehow envision sound waves knocking plaque of your teeth, this is how it is done. My whole head can feel it when I brush my teeth.The app works quite well. I'm not sure why it gets a bad rap. I don't know what more people could expect from it. The app more or less trains you how to use the toothbrush, then after a week or two, you can ditch the app and just brush your teeth on your own.I like the wireless charging device. You put your toothbrush in a small glass, which sits on the charger. It's really quite nice and is one of those ""why didn't I think of that?"" million dollar ideas that I never come up with on my own.Overall, I'm very happy with this toothbrush. My teeth have never felt cleaner. I don't think my teeth can get any whiter, and to be perfectly honest I don't want extremely white teeth. Then they look fake.I will definitely update this review after I visit my dentist in October.

Every time I go to brush my teeth after a meal, I now have to find my smartphone, select the right app, and see if I'm putting enough time and pressure (but not too much) on each tooth in my mouth.  The app tells me where I need to focus my attention,  It's like a videogame!  OK, maybe not, but in today's connected (maybe over-connected?) world, it was inevitable that Philips would connect its electric toothbrush to the world.Let's separate the fluff from the important parts here.  And keep in mind I say that as a (ahem) older person who's been using the Philips 9000 series of toothbrushes for many a year now, and fine them indispensable.  As a toothbrush, this 9300 model is a continuation of the other 9000-series brushes (I have three, in house, cottage, and office).  The rotary cleaning does a superb job of keeping my teeth clean, providing some flossing action (not that it replaces floss!), and with the feedback in the handle, let's me know when I push too hard on a tooth for optimum effect.  I can change heads, each of which focusses better on one aspect of cleaning than another, although I do that rarely.  My dentist continues to recommend brushing after every meal, and I have not had a cavity in the last decade, so the action of this Phiips 9000 series toothbrush plus regular use after each meal is to credit.  This 9300 is as good as any of the other 9000 series electrics I've tried and use from Philips.OK, so what about the extra features?  I tried the app: it shoes my progress on the screen, but a look in the mirror showed what a positive idiot I appeared brushing with one hand while holding the smartphone in the other to watch progress.  It was neat for about one minute, then I stopped using the app.  For any adult who's grown up brushing, the app is superfluous, although the statistics might be useful for some.  Where I think the app will play a bigger role, and is the device's target market, is for younger people.  When I showed the app to a friend's 8-year-old boy, he had to have one right away.  Video-gaming toothbrushes is perhaps a good way to get kids to brush better, or at least let parents monitor progress.  Is the app necessary?  Nope!  Is it cool for younger adults?  Yep.  If that leads to better oral hygiene, all is good.

This toothbrush works well. There were a number of features I liked, but I few I didn't appreciate as much.The package came with three brush heads, a travel case, charging glass and the handle.  There is no brush holder or rack. The brushes that come with the handle are intended for a single user (they are three different designs, made for different types of brushing).The handle is compact and fits nicely into a smaller hand.The travel case has no space for the charging glass/stand, so is only useful for the length of time that the handle stays charged.I did like the fact that the brushing modes have automatic shut-offs so you know when you have brushed a specific amount of time, even without using an app or timer.I didn't like the shape of the brush heads - they probably just take some ""getting used to"", but compared to other brands, these seemed small and a bit uncomfortable for me.The charging glass seems like a good idea, but if you ever use a bathroom glass for any other purpose besides brushing, this becomes a pain. I would rather have a stand and somewhere to keep the brush heads.Overall, this toothbrush works well, and is nicely designed.

Love my new Philips Soicare DiamondClean smart tooth brush.  It takes up so little space on my counter top and looks so elegant.  I love that it has 4 different modes...Clean, Whiten, Gum health, and Deep Clean. With just the press of a button you can choose any of these modes.  I do a minute on deep clean and a minute on whitening.  It is said to whiten your teeth after only two weeks of continuous use.  I will also be using the gum health mode all these modes are useful for healthy teeth and gums.  You use more of the ones you need the most.Smart sensors provide you personalized coaching and feedback by sending brushing data to the Philips Sonicare app via Bluetooth wireless technology, I haven't used this feature yet but it is on my to do list.It comes with extra tooth brush heads and a high quality travel case plus a heavy attractive glass cup; and  Includes an Instruction Manuel which is easy to understand.  I had my toothbrush up and ready to go in 5 minutes.  It has a two years warranty. For the price, it is definitely good value for money.  I'm actually looking forward to my next dental appointment because after using this toothbrush I feel like I will get a very good report.Highly recommended! for superior dental health.

I have to admit that I doubted about how good Sonicare could be even when I heard nice things about it. I owned good electric toothbrushes before Sonicare so I questioned how much better it could be. And the cost of the replacement heads are a little bit intimidating. However, after using Sonicare DaimondClean, I have to say I am very impressed with the performance.My teeth feel so much cleaner after brushing with Sonicare DaimondClean. The vibration and intensity are just right to me and you can adjust. It runs SO quiet. The handle is designed in such a good way that it is comfortable and effortless to hold.After two minutes of running, it stops automatically. Every time I feel sorry that two minutes passed already! It is very enjoyable to brush with this. It sounds exaggerating but I never felt this way with other toothbrushes before. I don't care about the Bluetooth function and app. Every fancy gadget nowadays has Bluetooth and app. I just care about how clean my teeth feel after brushing. Overall, it is a great electric toothbrush and I love it!

I've used several different electric toothbrushes now and this one is by far the best so far.  The other will still have a ""brushing"" type motion in your mouth which certainly works, but this one has a vibration instead.  This is MUCH less abrasive on your gums so if your gums are sensitive, this is a really good choice.I also have a couple problem areas where I quickly gather build-up at the base of a couple teeth, even after brushing.  This toothbrush blew through that build-up with ease.The charging is too easy and is quite a cute way of doing it.  Simply placing the brush into the cup (the cup sits on top of a charging disc) and it starts charging wirelessly.  This is fantastic.Unfortunately, I have no interest in the Bluetooth / app features that this toothbrush has so I can't really speak towards it.  However, if it's as good as the design and functionality of the toothbrush itself, then I would expect it to work great.

The philips sonicare toothbrushes are one thing that I have used for many, many years now and this is their newest lineup, the diamond clean. Its basically the same aas the old ones except that it has a bunch of new cleaning modes and comes with extra accessories. They really do clean your teeth in a much shorter time and much more thoroughly too. I tried a regular toothbrush when I went camping a while ago(forgot my sonicare) and it left my teeth feeling crusty and unclean in comparison.Anyhow, i love this toothbrush and will continue to use them for the rest of my life. I don't like the cup that comes with this though, seems unclean having to put your toothbrush in the cup to charge it and use it for rinsing afterwards.

I was lucky enough to try out this toothbrush. It seems very advanced, and space-like. Synced very easily to the app, although I must admit I haven't had the time to check out how well it works with the app- I will have to update this.The rinsing glass sits on a charging device, and when you're done.. You put the brush in the glass and it charges in there.I used a W brush and used it once, I noticed my teeth felt very much more clean after. I must admit, this may have been a little more expensive than I'd like to spend on a brush. But if funds are disposable, this is a very nice brush. It also has several brush tips, and several modes to use.

This is by far the  best toothbrush i have ever used! This toothbrush is smarter than me! aha. The app that comes with this toothbrush will help you achieve your goals for whiter teeth etc. I absolutely love Philips! They are sooo innovative its crazy. The cup charges the brush!!! Also the carrying case is sooo amazing. I love how the brush and the case feels. it is not cheap let me tell you that. I love how it comes with 3 different heads that have all different jobs. I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who wants healthier gums and a nicer smile!! This really does show results in just days! So worth the money!

The batteries won't last long on these brushes. Mine only lasted 1 year and it was useless. My 40 dollar electric toothbrush lasted longer. Google before you buy, otherwise you're throwing money down the drain.

 I have always wanted to try a Philips Sonicare and was thrilled when I was offered to try the DiamondClean.  It really tickles for the first couple of days until you get used to it but I went through a similar sensation when I first tried the Oral-B Genius 8000.  After using the DiamondClean for almost two weeks, I gotta say I am going to stick with my Oral-B.  The Sonicare cleans well but not as well as my Oral-B Genius (my teeth feel like I just left the dentist’s office after using the Oral-B but I did not get the same smooth feeling from the Sonicare).  However, I do feel this toothbrush does a great job on my gums.I prefer not to use the app, I take very good care of my teeth and do not require an app to help me along (I deleted the app after the first time trying this toothbrush).I personally would never spend over $100 for a toothbrush, for this price I really expected more.Pros• 3 different brush heads included (Whitening, Gum Care, & Plaque Control)• Includes Travel Case• Pressure sensor on bottom to indicate if brushing too hard• Charging Glass is so unique and doubles as a rinsing glass• A full charge has lasted me a lot longer than the Oral B• Multiple Cleaning Modes with 3 intensity settings• Very quietCons• Steep Price• Mediocre cleaning, not as good as Oral-B Genius• Bluetooth connectivity and App is gimmicky• Nowhere to store or rest your extra toothbrush heads• Replacement Brush Heads are very very expensive (3 for $37 vs 4 Oral-B Heads for $23)

Update (Jan 15, 2018) : Ever since a November update, I haven't been able to connect the toothbrush to the app. It still works, but it's missing all of the interactive features and tracking that the app offered. Because of that, I'm lowering my star rating to 3 out of five because the connectivity is a big selling feature of this product. If Philips can fix this, the rating will go back up to 5 out of 5.****** Quick Rating ******Pros:- Does a phenomenal job cleaning!- Gives you the incentive to brush more often.- Includes three different brush heads that offer their own benefits.- The charging glass looks beautiful.- Long battery life.- The Sonicare app extends the functionality of this brush.- The travel case is quite convenient.- Pressure sensor tells you if you're brushing too hard.- Change brush indicator (both on the handle and in the app).- 2-year warranty, which you can extend to 2.5 years if you register before a certain date.Cons:- Price.- Some people may find this confusing to use.- The Sonicare app doesn't always connect to the handset.- Can't add custom entries to the Sonicare app.**************************First and foremost, let me say one thing: You will immediately notice how well it cleans your teeth after the first use. This is no exaggeration - I take my time with regular brushing and felt I was doing a good job, but you can absolutely feel the difference in the smoothness and look of your teeth after using this Sonicare brush.I've used spinning and vibrating brushes in the past, but Sonicare is the best of the bunch by a long shot.This unit includes three different heads:- One specific for gum care.- One for Plaque control.- One for Whitening.All three will clean your teeth just fine, but it's nice to have specific options for personalized care.You also get a wireless charging stand that sits beneath a glass cup that you can use for rinsing your mouth with! To charge, you just put the toothbrush in the cup and voilà! It looks beautiful on any bathroom counter.The package also includes a travel case, which is used to store the handset and two other brushes). This model does not charge through the carrying case.You can download the Sonicare app on Android or iOS to further expand on the features for this brush, and it's recommended that you do because it gives you some features that you can only get in-app.Several other reviewers have noted that they've had problems with the app on Android - I haven't experienced many issues, but it does take several seconds for the app to connect to the brush. Not a big problem. I even received a firmware update through the app, and that went through smoothly.The Sonicare app offers several features that I really like:- It tells you exactly the life remaining on each brush (FYI: 3 months if you brush twice a day).- It keeps a recorded log of your daily brushings, whether you flossed, etc.- It can create reports that you can send to your dentists (not sure many people are using this feature, but it's a nice addition).- Offers you the option of creating your own personalized brushing goals where you can set goals based on how often you brush, whether you've brushed your tongue, etc. It also includes several built-in plans, which are worth using.- when using your brush, the app will show you which area of the mouth to focus on and it even shows the teeth getting ""cleaner"" on the graphic.- It warns if you're using too much motion or if you are using too much pressure (the brush handle will warn you if you are using too much pressure via a purple light on the very bottom of it).There are quite a few more features of the app, but it suffices to say that it gives you loads of extra options.That said, you can still use the brush on its own and it'll give you indications on when to brush another area of your mouth.  If you forget to use the app and you've been brushing, I found out that it'll sync those sessions to the app the next time you connect it (although, I don't know how many days it keeps in memory).My biggest complaint about the app is that you can't add custom entries to it. If I forgot to mention that I did floss yesterday evening, there's no way to add that it at the present time. Hopefully, this feature will be added in a future app update.Battery life with this brush is fantastic! The manual says 14 days, and that's probably right as I've gone for extended periods of time without charging it and it still says that it's full - this is great if you travel, especially considering the included travel case does not double as a charger.Overall, this is now a ""must have"" product for me and I can't imagine going back to manual brushing after this.

I hate to not to give a Sonicare DiamondClean product a full recommendation, because they are the best toothbrushes in the market.  I've had the older version of the DiamondClean without the bluetooth connectivity for quite some time now and even have given the best that Oral-B had to offer a try and continued to use my DiamondClean.  The Oral-B had the connected/app features before Philips did on their premium line and while at the time I didn't think the app control options really added much usefulness in day to day life - here is the thing - at least it worked.  I can't exactly say the same about the software layer draped on top of what is at it's core still the best toothbrush system on the market.This is the biggest problem I've had with the new DiamondClean, not the brushing, it's as good as it ever was and a few features like the brush head detection still make it a worthwhile successor but the app just doesn't work well enough for us that I can even properly review it.  We are an all Android household but neither my wife's nor my phone would work well enough with the Philips Sonicare app on the Play store that I can't say much more than that about it at this point.  To be fair, both of our phones are rooted and heavily modified with custom firmware and this may or may not be part of the issue but at the same time the Oral-B implementation has had no problems.  It may or may not be relevant to mention that the kid's version of the Sonicare that my son uses has an app that goes with it as well, and it worked really well for a few weeks after we got that toothbrush but then suddenly started refusing to connect to the toothbrush at all and I completely gave up on it and have not even tried to use it that way for a very long time.  I did notice that for some reason the app requires permission to my location when I first installed it, I can't fathom any valid reason for the app to know where I am in order to do what it needs to do, I imagine many people will be turned off by this too.App connectivity issues (and related features I can't yet explore) aside, which I am docking the review for, what I can talk about is the brushing and why I have stuck with DiamondClean in spite of giving the DiamondClean's best competition a serious try.  The biggest thing about Philips method that works for me more than others is that it seems to do just as good of a job at cleaning everything in my mouth but with far, far less irritation to my gums.  These brushes feel like precision instruments in your mouth where the ""round headed"" electric toothbrushes have felt like crude power tools.  After going from one to the other you're even tempted to question how the Sonicare can even be cleaning your teeth but really, they do the best job in the gentlest manner and when you're using something multiple times a day, every day, comfort counts for a lot.Like the old DiamondClean, the charging system and the carry case are also in my opinion best in class, high quality accessories that are nothing like afterthoughts.  Probably the best feature of the system is the charging glass, compared to any system that involves sticking the brush on a pedestal that physically contacts the brush.  First, the glass blends into the vanity and looks like something that belongs there and isn't an eyesore at all.  But most importantly, is the cleaning aspect.  The ""stands"" tend to collect left over water from the brush as it dribbles down the sides and it sits at the bottom of the brush and always gets gunked up with scum that I had always seemed to have been cleaning out but the charging glass system stays cleaner far longer and rinses out way easier than trying to scrub slime off the bottom of other chargers.The bottom line is, I could totally understand if someone were to give this particular version of the DiamondClean a pretty scathing review if they had connectivity issues like I do but my particular feeling having used connected toothbrush apps before is that they tend not to really offer enough real extra utility to every day brushing that I quickly don't care to use them anyway even when they are working fine.  I decided to knock only one star off my review for these problems because I honestly don't think it's a big deal if it works or not - the main benefits of the system have nothing to do with what happens on your phone and the toothbrush does these so well it's still worth it.  My advice would be to treat that as a nice bonus if it works but I would not purchase this toothbrush with the app connectivity as the sole driver for obvious reasons.  If it works better for you, great, if it doesn't but gets fixed at some point later also great, if it never works then I still don't really feel it detracts from the baseline performance of the toothbrush much anyway.

Been using mine a few nights. Cleans my teeth better than my plastic toothbrush. The bristles are what I'd call medium-soft, which might not be soft enough for some folks, but it gets my teeth very clean, so I can't complain.The bristles are polybutylene succinate, a biodegradable plastic. You can reuse or compost the handle at home, but you'll need to put the bristles into your municipal compost system. DIY composting doesn't get hot enough for them to degrade.Aside from that, no complaints.

This is a great toothbrush and much better than the older version (blue handle).It has a good grip and feels better made—more solid. The brushing feels more effecting and the battery seems to hold its charge better. (The older model's performance suffered when the battery was not fully charged.)Amazon may send you the older model, but it's just not worth it. (This happened to me 2 of 3 times.)

I have been a faithful Oral B electric toothbrush user for many years (5+ years) up until about a year ago when I replaced it with a different brand which I’ve been using since. The Oral B 500 electric toothbrush is a huge disappointment compared to my older Oral B model and my more recent one. The only thing I like about the Pro 500 brush is the small recharging base which takes up very little space.The toothbrush itself seems well made and the on/off button is responsive. The brush head fits snugly onto the toothbrush which sits on the charger without toppling easily. I don’t really care about the timer feature and never really pay attention to it – it’s more of an annoyance than a help as I spend more than enough time on each section of my mouth without needing a ‘reminder’. I wish it had a charging light instead of the timer function as I would find it more helpful to see how much charge I have left.PROS+ Small base for recharging+ Better than a manual toothbrushCONS- Pricey for such a basic electric toothbrush- No charging light- Bulky brush head- Single speed setting- Feels harsh and too abrasive for my teeth and gumsI feel like there are better electric toothbrushes out there (Oral B or otherwise) for a similar price or a bit more. I paid about $30 for my other electric toothbrush and I got much better results (dentist clean feeling!) compared to this Oral B Pro 500 which is more expensive. When looking for an electric toothbrush, I would highly recommend a model with at least two speed settings and a charging indicator light and you may prefer a rotating brush over a sonic one or vice versa.

Ok, it's a very basic rechargeable tooth brush and is quite frankly not worth $45.  It's not lithium, it's nickle metal battery, and there is no recharge light to indicate when it's charging - small thing but an irritant when it's missing. You should pass on this. Their are better or similar equipped mechanical tooth brushes at half the price of this one.Also not too impressed with Oral-B and their marketing shenanigans.  Fact is, this $45 tooth brush is the exact same mode as their $32 Oral-B Vitality - they're the exact same mode except one comes in a better package and is made in Germany, and the other comes in cheaper packaging and is made in Mexico, but also comes with an extra head. technically the 500 has a quad pacer timer, and the vitality a 2 min timer, but really isn't something worth an extra $12. The Vitality is way better value, but their are other brushes on the market that are even more affordable or have more features for the same price. Did i mention that these don't even have a light to let you know when they are charging??Technically their are way better deals out their, or models with more features for the same price.As for performance, it's way more effective than a mechanical brush, but this could be said for most if not all electric tooth brushes, and their are cheaper alternatives out there with better or comparable features.  As for the tech -  Oral-b uses a mechanical oscillation, which last time i checked did a marginally better job then sonic tooth brushes with plaque remove (~5%) but too small to really make a difference regarding which tech to buy, it's more a question on which tech feel's better to you, and that you'll uses. I know some don't like the sonic variety as it can take longer to get used to, but some also find the sonic versions quicker to uses because the brush head it bigger.  I've used both for about 20 years on and off - use the sonic for a while then the  mechanical, etc.. i find the Sonic quicker, but can get a better clean with the mechanical if i take my time.  Lastly, you need to replace the brush heads when they wear down, otherwise it does severely degrade their cleaning ability.

This is the same basic model of electric toothbrush I've had for many years and by basic, I mean it doesn't have any fancy features and comes at a reasonable price. It's not a bad thing. If you're looking to make the switch to electric and don't want to spend a lot, this is a great toothbrush. Even a cheaper electric toothbrush like this has benefits over manual brushing. '2 minute' timer is a bit misleading as it 'pauses' every 30 seconds, so it's more of a 'quarter' timer, useful if you brush your teeth in segments, but I tend to do top and then bottom teeth. Still, it's a way of keep track of time, which in this basic toothbrush is really handy to make sure you brush for long enough.It can be a little strange not 'brushing' your teeth at first (with this you hold it on each tooth and then move it along slowly after a few seconds), but it really does get them much cleaner. A big pro of this is that it isn't as loud as some comparable brands like Waterpik, or even some of the fancier toothbrushes. It's a comfortable level of volume at night, even for apartments (though it's obviously not whisper quiet, it's still buzzy). The charging is easy and doesn't take up a lot of room.One negative is that the silicone parts of the brush pick up hair really easy, so you'll want to give it a quick rinse after each use and be aware that the toothbrush handle might need cleaned occasionally. The only other downside of this is one you'll experience with all electric toothbrushes, cost of heads.A replacement pack of heads is pretty reasonable  - Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head 3 Count - when compared to some, but it's still around 7CAD (per head, pack of 3 at time of review) and at a recommended 3 months replacement time a pack will last you most of the year. That's more than you'd spend replacing manual toothbrushes, especially if you buy cheap brands, but it's giving a superior clean too.One really neat feature is that this model works with most of the replacement heads. You can buy off-brand if you're so inclined (obviously not supported by Oral-B), but you can also pick an Oral-B head with different features to get the kind of clean you want. If you prefer the 'brushing' movement of manual brushes you can even get a set of those - Oral B Vitality Deep Sweep Power Toothbrush - for almost the same price.Overall, a great basic electric brush that's very customisable and extremely simple to use, clean and travel with.

This is a great starting electric toothbrush and is similar to the electric toothbrush I had when I had braces as a teen. The toothbrush was simple and did the job. The Oral-B power pro 500 is very similar in that way, There is one button, On/Off, no complex charging system, no separate button for a timer, or other fancy things. If you are looking for that look at this version of the toothbrush. Oral-B Power Genius 8000 Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush Powered By Braun, Black. For no frills and simple, this is the one, the only *feature it has is a two-minute timer, the toothbrush head does a quick stop/start to tell you how long it has been. Comparing that my first electric toothbrush it is a nice and simple feature, that I find useful.Oral-B does offer cheaper Electric toothbrush. The vitality is the most basic Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, and is about half the cost, however, is the older verion.. what does this mean for a toothbrush... not a lot, just a different head. It also comes in a version that you need to put your own batteries in, knocking off another $10.Overall if you are looking for a basic toothbrush this one or the vitality will do the trick, and for the price difference both will do a good job, though I'm not 100% convinced this one is that much better than the vitality.

Oral-B has a number of power tooth brush variants and all are very good. Some of the costlier options come with neat features like phone apps that track brushing and all manner of other tooth related activities but I like this one for its simplicity.This is a straight forward no-frills power brush that gets the job done. Something it shares with the other brushes are the brush heads variants, there are a number of different replacement heads. The action of these heads varies from straight back and forth in a circle to pulsing and bobbing kind of actions. The point is that the variations you can have on this brush make it useful for a wide variety of people and the various situations individuals have with their teeth. There is one standard back and forth action brush included in my package. This is enough to get anyone going and I find the brushes last about as long as a regular stick brush but do a far better job.Like most other power brushes, it has a signal at the 30 second mark that it’s time to move on. Theory being that you spend 30 seconds on each quarter. It’s a handy thing to have so that I don’t spend too much or too little time on any part of the mouth. The indication is a double temporary interruption pulse in the motor and then it continues on. Some other brushes simply power down after the 2-minute mark, here it keeps going and giving the 30 second pulses.The main thing is that the brush does a stand-up job of cleaning the gunk and I can say that with using power brushes I spend far less time in a dentist’s chair while an assistant cleans plaque off of my nashers. I also appreciate that with all the action my gums don’t get beat up, something that I was expecting the first time I used one of these 20 some years ago. Oral-B has been making these things for a very long time!Charging is a breeze with the provided stand. Simply drop the power unit in its charging base and the unit is wirelessly charged, no open contacts means no worries about being electrocuted or contacts that might need cleaning. It takes a few hours for a full charge and I just leave it on the base overnight but then I get over a week’s worth of brushing, usually twice a day.For practical use I appreciate the silicone outer portions, they allow for a good grip even when wet.

This Oral B tooth brush does a much better job than a manual brush and is a very basic introductory level to  electric toothbrushes (charging base, handle and brush). I prefer the oscillating head that comes with this unit since  I find they do a better job especially around and between the teeth than the swiping motion ones. The unit only has an on and off switch with no LED lights to indicate it is charging or needs charging. Really miss that feature even though the unit does hold a charge for about 5 to 7 days and cannot be overcharged if left on its base.  Like with other electric toothbrush the off and on switch  can be difficult to locate quickly and even pressing it especially if hands are wet/slippery.  The two minute warning feature to suggest the  a recommended brushing time was an unexpected extra bonus which would be great in encouraging children to do a proper job. The brush head the unit came with was Ok but a bit too hard  but that can be easily replaced with other. I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for several years and do prefer ones that have a few more features like LED power light and pressure sensor. For what one gets with this unit, I consider it to be overpriced and does not even come with a 2nd brush or a coupon for more brushes when they need to be replaced (about every three months). However it did a good overall job of what it is supposed to do, cleaning teeth, but after having other features ( at least a charging light) on other Oral B toothbrushes I still would stick with those instead .

Oral-B has long been a household name in the dental industry and an elephant in the room in dental care products for long time. They have more than 10 variations of electric toothbrushes and Oral-B Professional 500 series brush is the base model and is the cheapest Professional Series toothbrush you can buy.Features of Oral-B Professional 500:Oral-B Professional 500 is minimalist toothbrush and there is not much to expect in terms of features here but it does not mean they are inferior in brushing.  It offers good cleaning action- plain and simple. And, you won’t expect much at this price. The round shape of toothbrush head cleans tooth by tooth with 2D cleaning action (that oscillates and rotates) for much more plaque removal vs. a regular manual toothbrush. Here is what you get:  • Comes with a 2 Minute timer that signals when your two minutes of recommended brushing is complete. Important! Most people tend to rush  their brushing and hence not clean properly.  • It comes with rechargeable batteries and one charge lasts around 5 days.  And, that’s the end of list.It is great toothbrush for someone who is considering trying electric toothbrush. It has not much to offer in terms of features compared to Oral-B Professional series, but if you are looking for basic toothbrush that offer better cleaning than manual toothbrush, you cannot go wrong with this. It is also good toothbrush to introduce kids to electric toothbrush. And, believe me kids tends to gravitate and attract towards electric toothbrushes more.Cons:Again, this is budget toothbrush and does not come with any fancy brushing modes, LED display, Bluetooth or Pressure Sensor. Having used Oral-B professional series 6000 toothbrush, pressure sensor is the important feature that is missing here. Pressure sensor reduces the chances of damaging tooth enamel from too much pressure. It is biggest missing feature here. There is also no quadrant timer with this brush. This basically signals you every 30 seconds, letting you know when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth for a truly complete cleaning. Both of these features are basic to professional series brushing and available on ORAL-B Professional 1000. If can spend little more, I would highly recommend ORAL-B Professional 1000 over this toothbrush. With very basic feature sets, I do not think this toothbrush qualifies to be called Professional Series toothbrush.Conclusion:In conclusion, The ORAL-B Professional 500 is a good beginner toothbrush in professional series. However, it is missing basic features to be qualifies as professional brush.

My six years old kid is using the brush. I much appreciate the two minutes timer, and it actually helps ME to make sure my kids is cleaning his teeth properly. The brush is simple with one on/off button. The handle is not heavy, covered with silicon to avoid slipping, and convenient to hold, though it's a little hand. Oral-B manufacturing high-quality brushes, starting from basic ones, what we call manual and the sky their limit.Recommended.

Oral-B electric toothbrushes are simply the bests out there. I've personaly used various brands over the years but always come back to these ones, with due reason.Here are a few things that make them stand out: they hold their charge well (even after years, not so much for other brands i've used), replacement brush heads are easier to get your hands on then most competitors I find, the only downside is that they tend to be more expensive. But given the importance of teeth, I don't mind paying extra for a good quality product.I wish I could say this model particularly stands out on many points, but it is not the case from my perspective, only another solid product in the Oral-B electric toothbrush line. It claims to hold charge for 5 days of charging, which is actually true and is really the main point where it stands out.
"
"
Like all Oral-B electronic toothbrushes, I find this one cleans well; much better than a regular brush but I find it lacking compared to some other lesser priced models the Oral-B line.The major thing I complain about with this brush is the lack of power. It often will stop rotating when I apply moderate pressure while brushing (starts again once I reduce the pressure).So even though this brush does a good job cleaning I would prefer the less expensive but better working Oral-B 3D white electronic toothbrush, that comes with two heads instead of one, has a polishing cup in the centre of the head, and is much more powerful and has never stopped on me due to applied pressure. The 3D white brush seems to be a much better value to me and having tried it as well; I would recommend it.

Honestly I bought a $200 electric toothbrush at Costco a few years ago, and this toothbrush give a comparable clean at a fraction of the cost. The brush heads are not unreasonably priced either, you can find the type that comes mounted on the brush here: Oral-B Cross Action Brush Head Refills however if you wanted to buy a less expensive oral B brush head, that is one way to cut costs.I find that this brush leaves nothing behind, and since I didn't have to remove my wisdom teeth it is sometimes hard to get the very back of my mouth without electric toothbrush bases going into my mouth, but this one has the length to get those extra teeth without any discomfort.Highly recommend!
"
"
Wow! This makes brushing so much easier! Only drawback is I wish it came with 2 heads, one for my wife.  Although it does come with coupons for replacement heads, but another would have made this product 5 out of 5.I get an extremely clean smile without much effort.  I have light gingivitis however only during the primary brushing did gums bleed.  It's very gentle when it cleans.It comes with a rechargeable docking station, and while you can't tell when it's charged from an LED prospective, it simply works well and holds a charge for 7+ days!The replacement brushes have rings for his and her and whole family color coordination.  Which truly does make things easier.Great option, never going back to manual brushing!!!!  Oral B all the way!

Very nice electric toothbrush.I have used electric toothbrushes for years and, ever since switching to them, I have yet to get a cavity.  You get such a higher level of clean that it's totally worth it.They do often have a lifespan of just 2-3 years so the low price on this one is great.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the $200 ones - no fancy stand, no ""sterilizing"" feature, no multiple speeds, etc... but to be honest I rarely used those features anyways.As a major plus, the head of it is smaller than many.  In fact my dentist recommends Oral B over other ones because, with the small round head, if you have a small jaw it is MUCH easier to get to the back molars.
"
"
The is a pretty Basic oral-b toothbrush only comes with 1 head however it's pretty cool you can use this in the shower. Not sure many would take advantage of that feature however. Pricepoint right now is fair at 45$. Brissles is a fair quality but as I said b4 there is only 1 brush this is an issue if your a family of 2 or more you will need to spend 15$+ right off the bat. Other models I have reviewed comes with 2 brushes.On a budget or Starter kit it's ok.

J'adore cette brosse à dents rotative, c'est ma première je n'ai donc pas de point de référence mais je trouve que çà fait un bon travail, j'ai l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste. Je fais beaucoup de tartre je verrai donc avec le temps si c'est vraiment efficaceMerci

Great product that arrived when the company said it would.

I'm pleased with this electric toothbrush for $44.99 (at the time of this review).It works exactly as it should.It's waterproof which makes rinsing it after each use a breeze.It has a 2 minute timer - at which point it will vibrate to let you know that you've brushed long enough. (Although I do like the feature on other Oral B units that vibrate every 30 seconds so you know to switch to a different section of your mouth.)A full charge takes 16 hours and allows for 5 days of regular brushing. (Twice a day, 2 minutes each time.)You can leave the handle stored on the charging unit to ensure it's always fully charged. (You can't overcharge it.) The only thing about that is that I don't like so much clutter on my bathroom counter, so it would be nicer if a charge laster longer than 5 days.(If you leave the unit charging all the time the manual recommends  letting it fully drain at least every 6 months.)Anyway, depending on how much you want to spend on an electric toothbrush, this one is solid.
"

Having used oral-B brushes for 25 + years this one is  very good. After a charged it  is still running 10 days later without having been plucked in.

As one of the basic models of Oral-B's Pro line it does all you need a basic electric brush to do, that is, remove plaque, food particles in a circular motion. Oral-B does oscillating or circular motion vs. another popular brand that is linear (goes back and forth only), which is technically more effective, but electric is by far more effective than regular toothbrushes/manual ones.This unit does the basics, timer, has a good battery, replaceable head. That's all you really need. Pair this with a cheap dental floss and a regular routine, you should be good to go for years without cavities. Replacement heads are crucial since the bristles do 'splay' out and can cause trauma to your gums and lead to recession so be gentle around gums and replace heads when they splay out, the timing of which is different for everyone. All the fancy gadgets and connectivity of those bluetooth or wifi connection to apps are unnecessary in my opinion and I would just stick with the least expensive option as they all do the same thing ultimately: remove plaque and bacteria. Battery lasts more than 5 days, I could get up to a couple weeks easy.Pros:-all the basics-replaceable brush head that's interchangeable with other models-wide selection of brush heads-battery-healthier teeth!Cons:-upfront cost?-no travel kit-not too many extra heads included

At first I wasn't too sure about this toothbrush because the supplied brush head was very firm and hurt my gums.  But after a few days it softened and was more comfortable to use.  The motor is really quite powerful and the hand grip is solid and easy to hold.  I charge it using the charger stand every other night and that provides all the power I need.  I don't leave it on the charger 24/7 like most people do because I have found after a decade of using electric toothbrushes that this shortens the lifetime.  There's just a simple on/off button and that's the way I like it.  The brush pulses when it's time to move to the next quadrant of my mouth.  I used to have a very similar Oral B toothbrush and it lasted several years so I have faith in this one to do the same.  The price on electric toothbrushes is still too high for what they are, and when you strip this one down and realise that it's nothing more than a tiny motor, a switch and two rechargeable AAA batteries you can get an idea of just how overpriced electric toothbrushes are.  The replacement heads are a rip-off but aftermarket heads are available for very cheap now.

This is a solidly good simple electric toothbrush. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive models (no apps, no fancy stands), but what it does have is a great cleaning action. Oral-B brushes rotate, kind of like your dentist's cleaning tools, and I think it provides the best clean out there. I've tried Waterpik and Sonicare brushes, but to me the Oral-B method cleans my teeth the best. As an added bonus, I find that the vibrations of the Oral-B brush does not aggravate my TMJ issues like the competitors do.This is a rather simple brush with only one cleaning mode--if you want a sensitivity mode you'll want to check out a different model. It lasts at least five days, brushing twice a day, on a single charge, making this a great option for a brush to take to the gym or the office for the week and then bring home to charge on the weekend. It also has the built-in 2 minute timer, where the brush does a little pause in its vibration every 30 seconds, to help you brush your teeth for the full recommended time.Basic it may be, this electric tooth brush does a great job cleaning.

Before this toothbrush I had been using a another Oral B electric one. It was almost exact to this one but I can't find the model number on it. It's been great to me so I wanted to give this one a try. I'm equally as happy with this one. I'm also pretty confident it will stand up to the test of time seeing how my old one I've owned for a few years now and it's still going strong.There's just something about a good electric tooth brush that makes your teeth feel and look so much cleaner. In my opinion they work so much better than a regular or sonic toothbrush. It's also easier, especially the way this one is designed to clean each individual tooth. The timer is also nice so that you know you've brushed for the right amount of time. It also breaks up the time into intervals allowing you to get each section equally. It's a  basic, good quality electric toothbrush that does give great results.

This electric toothbrush is about what you'd expect, however I'm sure not quite sure of the price tag compared to other competitors, including other Oral-B toothbrushes.My gums needed some adjusting to this brush coming from a manual brush but in general it is quite powerful. My teeth feel a lot cleaner compared to regular brushing over the last couple of weeks and I have come to enjoy the 2 minute timer as well. Charging is no issue and the toothbrush holds a charge for close to a week - however its just as easy to leave it on the charger as it acts as a stand as well. The downside to this is that it may take up some counter space.Oral-B's own brand offers a cheaper electric toothbrush than this, and I am unsure if there is a major difference. Overall I would certainly recommend this brush compared to a manual one, however I'm not sure I would splurge on this particular model myself.

I have always used a manual tooth brush because I can scrub as much as I like to get my teeth clean. No need to worry about batteries or recharges etc. After receiving this oral-b power pro I am switching to a better way.The brush head is small enough for me to get at my gums even at the back of my mouth which is something I haven’t been able to do with the other powered brushes. I like the feel of the bristles along with the rotating action. It feels like I am really doing a good cleaning job on my mouth with a lot less effort.It’s a powerful no nonsense standard brush that’s easy to use and clean. The handle seems to fit my hand in such a way that angling it to get the tough spots is a breeze. All things considered I feel it’s a quality brush that will last. One that I will want to keep using.With the brush head reasonably priced and it being a recharging unit this Oral-B Power Pro is well worth the bucks.
"
"
Purchased this as my last Oral-B electric brush finally stopped holding a charge (after 11 years). They don't appear to make that model any longer, but hopefully this one will have a similar longevity. Even if it only has half the lifetime, I'm pretty sure I'll be satisfied though. This one too works great (so much better than a manual brush, that they aren't even comparable). I'll NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush again, and I do believe Oral-B is the best!
"
"
Don't misunderstand. This is a good toothbrush. it is just in no way worth the $50 it is currently listed at. The toothbrush being sold for $33 (vitality 3d) is essentially the same toothbrush body however it has the better heads (with the gum massager). In addition, this toothbrush only comes with one head where as the Vitality 3D comes with two. The only way this toothbrush is better than the vitality 3D is when you look at the packaging. This one comes with a nice box where as the Vitality 3D comes in regular old blister packaging. That's worth the extra $17, right?

Right when i received this in the mail i was so excited to open it. I opened it and noticed i received an extra brush head and i was really happy with that. The toothbrush is built well and is rather cheap. The toothbrush feels powerful and it feels like it is doing a very good job in cleaning in which it is. When i had finished brushing my teeth they felt cleaner than usual which is a sign that this toothbrush is excellent. I do recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs one or even wants one. I love it

This one is one of the low end products in Oral B electric toothbrush family but the performance is still solid. There are not a lot of bells and whistles.  There is an on/off button. The 2 minutes timer is useful in reminding you of the recommended brushing time. The toothbrush uses recharbable battery which is handy.If you are looking for a simple and basic design that gets job done, this is the toothbrush for you.
"
"
This is a great toothbrush and much better than the older version (blue handle).It has a good grip and feels better made—more solid. The brushing feels more effecting and the battery seems to hold its charge better. (The older model's performance suffered when the battery was not fully charged.)Amazon may send you the older model, but it's just not worth it. (This happened to me 2 of 3 times.)

I have been a faithful Oral B electric toothbrush user for many years (5+ years) up until about a year ago when I replaced it with a different brand which I’ve been using since. The Oral B 500 electric toothbrush is a huge disappointment compared to my older Oral B model and my more recent one. The only thing I like about the Pro 500 brush is the small recharging base which takes up very little space.The toothbrush itself seems well made and the on/off button is responsive. The brush head fits snugly onto the toothbrush which sits on the charger without toppling easily. I don’t really care about the timer feature and never really pay attention to it – it’s more of an annoyance than a help as I spend more than enough time on each section of my mouth without needing a ‘reminder’. I wish it had a charging light instead of the timer function as I would find it more helpful to see how much charge I have left.PROS+ Small base for recharging+ Better than a manual toothbrushCONS- Pricey for such a basic electric toothbrush- No charging light- Bulky brush head- Single speed setting- Feels harsh and too abrasive for my teeth and gumsI feel like there are better electric toothbrushes out there (Oral B or otherwise) for a similar price or a bit more. I paid about $30 for my other electric toothbrush and I got much better results (dentist clean feeling!) compared to this Oral B Pro 500 which is more expensive. When looking for an electric toothbrush, I would highly recommend a model with at least two speed settings and a charging indicator light and you may prefer a rotating brush over a sonic one or vice versa.

Ok, it's a very basic rechargeable tooth brush and is quite frankly not worth $45.  It's not lithium, it's nickle metal battery, and there is no recharge light to indicate when it's charging - small thing but an irritant when it's missing. You should pass on this. Their are better or similar equipped mechanical tooth brushes at half the price of this one.Also not too impressed with Oral-B and their marketing shenanigans.  Fact is, this $45 tooth brush is the exact same mode as their $32 Oral-B Vitality - they're the exact same mode except one comes in a better package and is made in Germany, and the other comes in cheaper packaging and is made in Mexico, but also comes with an extra head. technically the 500 has a quad pacer timer, and the vitality a 2 min timer, but really isn't something worth an extra $12. The Vitality is way better value, but their are other brushes on the market that are even more affordable or have more features for the same price. Did i mention that these don't even have a light to let you know when they are charging??Technically their are way better deals out their, or models with more features for the same price.As for performance, it's way more effective than a mechanical brush, but this could be said for most if not all electric tooth brushes, and their are cheaper alternatives out there with better or comparable features.  As for the tech -  Oral-b uses a mechanical oscillation, which last time i checked did a marginally better job then sonic tooth brushes with plaque remove (~5%) but too small to really make a difference regarding which tech to buy, it's more a question on which tech feel's better to you, and that you'll uses. I know some don't like the sonic variety as it can take longer to get used to, but some also find the sonic versions quicker to uses because the brush head it bigger.  I've used both for about 20 years on and off - use the sonic for a while then the  mechanical, etc.. i find the Sonic quicker, but can get a better clean with the mechanical if i take my time.  Lastly, you need to replace the brush heads when they wear down, otherwise it does severely degrade their cleaning ability.

This is the same basic model of electric toothbrush I've had for many years and by basic, I mean it doesn't have any fancy features and comes at a reasonable price. It's not a bad thing. If you're looking to make the switch to electric and don't want to spend a lot, this is a great toothbrush. Even a cheaper electric toothbrush like this has benefits over manual brushing. '2 minute' timer is a bit misleading as it 'pauses' every 30 seconds, so it's more of a 'quarter' timer, useful if you brush your teeth in segments, but I tend to do top and then bottom teeth. Still, it's a way of keep track of time, which in this basic toothbrush is really handy to make sure you brush for long enough.It can be a little strange not 'brushing' your teeth at first (with this you hold it on each tooth and then move it along slowly after a few seconds), but it really does get them much cleaner. A big pro of this is that it isn't as loud as some comparable brands like Waterpik, or even some of the fancier toothbrushes. It's a comfortable level of volume at night, even for apartments (though it's obviously not whisper quiet, it's still buzzy). The charging is easy and doesn't take up a lot of room.One negative is that the silicone parts of the brush pick up hair really easy, so you'll want to give it a quick rinse after each use and be aware that the toothbrush handle might need cleaned occasionally. The only other downside of this is one you'll experience with all electric toothbrushes, cost of heads.A replacement pack of heads is pretty reasonable  - Oral-B Precision Clean Replacement Electric Toothbrush Head 3 Count - when compared to some, but it's still around 7CAD (per head, pack of 3 at time of review) and at a recommended 3 months replacement time a pack will last you most of the year. That's more than you'd spend replacing manual toothbrushes, especially if you buy cheap brands, but it's giving a superior clean too.One really neat feature is that this model works with most of the replacement heads. You can buy off-brand if you're so inclined (obviously not supported by Oral-B), but you can also pick an Oral-B head with different features to get the kind of clean you want. If you prefer the 'brushing' movement of manual brushes you can even get a set of those - Oral B Vitality Deep Sweep Power Toothbrush - for almost the same price.Overall, a great basic electric brush that's very customisable and extremely simple to use, clean and travel with.

This is a great starting electric toothbrush and is similar to the electric toothbrush I had when I had braces as a teen. The toothbrush was simple and did the job. The Oral-B power pro 500 is very similar in that way, There is one button, On/Off, no complex charging system, no separate button for a timer, or other fancy things. If you are looking for that look at this version of the toothbrush. Oral-B Power Genius 8000 Electric Rechargeable Toothbrush Powered By Braun, Black. For no frills and simple, this is the one, the only *feature it has is a two-minute timer, the toothbrush head does a quick stop/start to tell you how long it has been. Comparing that my first electric toothbrush it is a nice and simple feature, that I find useful.Oral-B does offer cheaper Electric toothbrush. The vitality is the most basic Oral-B Vitality Dual Clean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, and is about half the cost, however, is the older verion.. what does this mean for a toothbrush... not a lot, just a different head. It also comes in a version that you need to put your own batteries in, knocking off another $10.Overall if you are looking for a basic toothbrush this one or the vitality will do the trick, and for the price difference both will do a good job, though I'm not 100% convinced this one is that much better than the vitality.

Oral-B has a number of power tooth brush variants and all are very good. Some of the costlier options come with neat features like phone apps that track brushing and all manner of other tooth related activities but I like this one for its simplicity.This is a straight forward no-frills power brush that gets the job done. Something it shares with the other brushes are the brush heads variants, there are a number of different replacement heads. The action of these heads varies from straight back and forth in a circle to pulsing and bobbing kind of actions. The point is that the variations you can have on this brush make it useful for a wide variety of people and the various situations individuals have with their teeth. There is one standard back and forth action brush included in my package. This is enough to get anyone going and I find the brushes last about as long as a regular stick brush but do a far better job.Like most other power brushes, it has a signal at the 30 second mark that it’s time to move on. Theory being that you spend 30 seconds on each quarter. It’s a handy thing to have so that I don’t spend too much or too little time on any part of the mouth. The indication is a double temporary interruption pulse in the motor and then it continues on. Some other brushes simply power down after the 2-minute mark, here it keeps going and giving the 30 second pulses.The main thing is that the brush does a stand-up job of cleaning the gunk and I can say that with using power brushes I spend far less time in a dentist’s chair while an assistant cleans plaque off of my nashers. I also appreciate that with all the action my gums don’t get beat up, something that I was expecting the first time I used one of these 20 some years ago. Oral-B has been making these things for a very long time!Charging is a breeze with the provided stand. Simply drop the power unit in its charging base and the unit is wirelessly charged, no open contacts means no worries about being electrocuted or contacts that might need cleaning. It takes a few hours for a full charge and I just leave it on the base overnight but then I get over a week’s worth of brushing, usually twice a day.For practical use I appreciate the silicone outer portions, they allow for a good grip even when wet.

This Oral B tooth brush does a much better job than a manual brush and is a very basic introductory level to  electric toothbrushes (charging base, handle and brush). I prefer the oscillating head that comes with this unit since  I find they do a better job especially around and between the teeth than the swiping motion ones. The unit only has an on and off switch with no LED lights to indicate it is charging or needs charging. Really miss that feature even though the unit does hold a charge for about 5 to 7 days and cannot be overcharged if left on its base.  Like with other electric toothbrush the off and on switch  can be difficult to locate quickly and even pressing it especially if hands are wet/slippery.  The two minute warning feature to suggest the  a recommended brushing time was an unexpected extra bonus which would be great in encouraging children to do a proper job. The brush head the unit came with was Ok but a bit too hard  but that can be easily replaced with other. I have used Oral B electric toothbrushes for several years and do prefer ones that have a few more features like LED power light and pressure sensor. For what one gets with this unit, I consider it to be overpriced and does not even come with a 2nd brush or a coupon for more brushes when they need to be replaced (about every three months). However it did a good overall job of what it is supposed to do, cleaning teeth, but after having other features ( at least a charging light) on other Oral B toothbrushes I still would stick with those instead .

Oral-B has long been a household name in the dental industry and an elephant in the room in dental care products for long time. They have more than 10 variations of electric toothbrushes and Oral-B Professional 500 series brush is the base model and is the cheapest Professional Series toothbrush you can buy.Features of Oral-B Professional 500:Oral-B Professional 500 is minimalist toothbrush and there is not much to expect in terms of features here but it does not mean they are inferior in brushing.  It offers good cleaning action- plain and simple. And, you won’t expect much at this price. The round shape of toothbrush head cleans tooth by tooth with 2D cleaning action (that oscillates and rotates) for much more plaque removal vs. a regular manual toothbrush. Here is what you get:  • Comes with a 2 Minute timer that signals when your two minutes of recommended brushing is complete. Important! Most people tend to rush  their brushing and hence not clean properly.  • It comes with rechargeable batteries and one charge lasts around 5 days.  And, that’s the end of list.It is great toothbrush for someone who is considering trying electric toothbrush. It has not much to offer in terms of features compared to Oral-B Professional series, but if you are looking for basic toothbrush that offer better cleaning than manual toothbrush, you cannot go wrong with this. It is also good toothbrush to introduce kids to electric toothbrush. And, believe me kids tends to gravitate and attract towards electric toothbrushes more.Cons:Again, this is budget toothbrush and does not come with any fancy brushing modes, LED display, Bluetooth or Pressure Sensor. Having used Oral-B professional series 6000 toothbrush, pressure sensor is the important feature that is missing here. Pressure sensor reduces the chances of damaging tooth enamel from too much pressure. It is biggest missing feature here. There is also no quadrant timer with this brush. This basically signals you every 30 seconds, letting you know when to move to a different quadrant of your mouth for a truly complete cleaning. Both of these features are basic to professional series brushing and available on ORAL-B Professional 1000. If can spend little more, I would highly recommend ORAL-B Professional 1000 over this toothbrush. With very basic feature sets, I do not think this toothbrush qualifies to be called Professional Series toothbrush.Conclusion:In conclusion, The ORAL-B Professional 500 is a good beginner toothbrush in professional series. However, it is missing basic features to be qualifies as professional brush.

My six years old kid is using the brush. I much appreciate the two minutes timer, and it actually helps ME to make sure my kids is cleaning his teeth properly. The brush is simple with one on/off button. The handle is not heavy, covered with silicon to avoid slipping, and convenient to hold, though it's a little hand. Oral-B manufacturing high-quality brushes, starting from basic ones, what we call manual and the sky their limit.Recommended.

Oral-B electric toothbrushes are simply the bests out there. I've personaly used various brands over the years but always come back to these ones, with due reason.Here are a few things that make them stand out: they hold their charge well (even after years, not so much for other brands i've used), replacement brush heads are easier to get your hands on then most competitors I find, the only downside is that they tend to be more expensive. But given the importance of teeth, I don't mind paying extra for a good quality product.I wish I could say this model particularly stands out on many points, but it is not the case from my perspective, only another solid product in the Oral-B electric toothbrush line. It claims to hold charge for 5 days of charging, which is actually true and is really the main point where it stands out.
"
"
Like all Oral-B electronic toothbrushes, I find this one cleans well; much better than a regular brush but I find it lacking compared to some other lesser priced models the Oral-B line.The major thing I complain about with this brush is the lack of power. It often will stop rotating when I apply moderate pressure while brushing (starts again once I reduce the pressure).So even though this brush does a good job cleaning I would prefer the less expensive but better working Oral-B 3D white electronic toothbrush, that comes with two heads instead of one, has a polishing cup in the centre of the head, and is much more powerful and has never stopped on me due to applied pressure. The 3D white brush seems to be a much better value to me and having tried it as well; I would recommend it.

Honestly I bought a $200 electric toothbrush at Costco a few years ago, and this toothbrush give a comparable clean at a fraction of the cost. The brush heads are not unreasonably priced either, you can find the type that comes mounted on the brush here: Oral-B Cross Action Brush Head Refills however if you wanted to buy a less expensive oral B brush head, that is one way to cut costs.I find that this brush leaves nothing behind, and since I didn't have to remove my wisdom teeth it is sometimes hard to get the very back of my mouth without electric toothbrush bases going into my mouth, but this one has the length to get those extra teeth without any discomfort.Highly recommend!
"
"
Wow! This makes brushing so much easier! Only drawback is I wish it came with 2 heads, one for my wife.  Although it does come with coupons for replacement heads, but another would have made this product 5 out of 5.I get an extremely clean smile without much effort.  I have light gingivitis however only during the primary brushing did gums bleed.  It's very gentle when it cleans.It comes with a rechargeable docking station, and while you can't tell when it's charged from an LED prospective, it simply works well and holds a charge for 7+ days!The replacement brushes have rings for his and her and whole family color coordination.  Which truly does make things easier.Great option, never going back to manual brushing!!!!  Oral B all the way!

Very nice electric toothbrush.I have used electric toothbrushes for years and, ever since switching to them, I have yet to get a cavity.  You get such a higher level of clean that it's totally worth it.They do often have a lifespan of just 2-3 years so the low price on this one is great.  It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the $200 ones - no fancy stand, no ""sterilizing"" feature, no multiple speeds, etc... but to be honest I rarely used those features anyways.As a major plus, the head of it is smaller than many.  In fact my dentist recommends Oral B over other ones because, with the small round head, if you have a small jaw it is MUCH easier to get to the back molars.
"
"
The is a pretty Basic oral-b toothbrush only comes with 1 head however it's pretty cool you can use this in the shower. Not sure many would take advantage of that feature however. Pricepoint right now is fair at 45$. Brissles is a fair quality but as I said b4 there is only 1 brush this is an issue if your a family of 2 or more you will need to spend 15$+ right off the bat. Other models I have reviewed comes with 2 brushes.On a budget or Starter kit it's ok.

J'adore cette brosse à dents rotative, c'est ma première je n'ai donc pas de point de référence mais je trouve que çà fait un bon travail, j'ai l'impression de sortir de chez le dentiste. Je fais beaucoup de tartre je verrai donc avec le temps si c'est vraiment efficaceMerci

I'm pleased with this electric toothbrush for $44.99 (at the time of this review).It works exactly as it should.It's waterproof which makes rinsing it after each use a breeze.It has a 2 minute timer - at which point it will vibrate to let you know that you've brushed long enough. (Although I do like the feature on other Oral B units that vibrate every 30 seconds so you know to switch to a different section of your mouth.)A full charge takes 16 hours and allows for 5 days of regular brushing. (Twice a day, 2 minutes each time.)You can leave the handle stored on the charging unit to ensure it's always fully charged. (You can't overcharge it.) The only thing about that is that I don't like so much clutter on my bathroom counter, so it would be nicer if a charge laster longer than 5 days.(If you leave the unit charging all the time the manual recommends  letting it fully drain at least every 6 months.)Anyway, depending on how much you want to spend on an electric toothbrush, this one is solid.
"

Having used oral-B brushes for 25 + years this one is  very good. After a charged it  is still running 10 days later without having been plucked in.

As one of the basic models of Oral-B's Pro line it does all you need a basic electric brush to do, that is, remove plaque, food particles in a circular motion. Oral-B does oscillating or circular motion vs. another popular brand that is linear (goes back and forth only), which is technically more effective, but electric is by far more effective than regular toothbrushes/manual ones.This unit does the basics, timer, has a good battery, replaceable head. That's all you really need. Pair this with a cheap dental floss and a regular routine, you should be good to go for years without cavities. Replacement heads are crucial since the bristles do 'splay' out and can cause trauma to your gums and lead to recession so be gentle around gums and replace heads when they splay out, the timing of which is different for everyone. All the fancy gadgets and connectivity of those bluetooth or wifi connection to apps are unnecessary in my opinion and I would just stick with the least expensive option as they all do the same thing ultimately: remove plaque and bacteria. Battery lasts more than 5 days, I could get up to a couple weeks easy.Pros:-all the basics-replaceable brush head that's interchangeable with other models-wide selection of brush heads-battery-healthier teeth!Cons:-upfront cost?-no travel kit-not too many extra heads included

At first I wasn't too sure about this toothbrush because the supplied brush head was very firm and hurt my gums.  But after a few days it softened and was more comfortable to use.  The motor is really quite powerful and the hand grip is solid and easy to hold.  I charge it using the charger stand every other night and that provides all the power I need.  I don't leave it on the charger 24/7 like most people do because I have found after a decade of using electric toothbrushes that this shortens the lifetime.  There's just a simple on/off button and that's the way I like it.  The brush pulses when it's time to move to the next quadrant of my mouth.  I used to have a very similar Oral B toothbrush and it lasted several years so I have faith in this one to do the same.  The price on electric toothbrushes is still too high for what they are, and when you strip this one down and realise that it's nothing more than a tiny motor, a switch and two rechargeable AAA batteries you can get an idea of just how overpriced electric toothbrushes are.  The replacement heads are a rip-off but aftermarket heads are available for very cheap now.

This is a solidly good simple electric toothbrush. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive models (no apps, no fancy stands), but what it does have is a great cleaning action. Oral-B brushes rotate, kind of like your dentist's cleaning tools, and I think it provides the best clean out there. I've tried Waterpik and Sonicare brushes, but to me the Oral-B method cleans my teeth the best. As an added bonus, I find that the vibrations of the Oral-B brush does not aggravate my TMJ issues like the competitors do.This is a rather simple brush with only one cleaning mode--if you want a sensitivity mode you'll want to check out a different model. It lasts at least five days, brushing twice a day, on a single charge, making this a great option for a brush to take to the gym or the office for the week and then bring home to charge on the weekend. It also has the built-in 2 minute timer, where the brush does a little pause in its vibration every 30 seconds, to help you brush your teeth for the full recommended time.Basic it may be, this electric tooth brush does a great job cleaning.

Before this toothbrush I had been using a another Oral B electric one. It was almost exact to this one but I can't find the model number on it. It's been great to me so I wanted to give this one a try. I'm equally as happy with this one. I'm also pretty confident it will stand up to the test of time seeing how my old one I've owned for a few years now and it's still going strong.There's just something about a good electric tooth brush that makes your teeth feel and look so much cleaner. In my opinion they work so much better than a regular or sonic toothbrush. It's also easier, especially the way this one is designed to clean each individual tooth. The timer is also nice so that you know you've brushed for the right amount of time. It also breaks up the time into intervals allowing you to get each section equally. It's a  basic, good quality electric toothbrush that does give great results.

This electric toothbrush is about what you'd expect, however I'm sure not quite sure of the price tag compared to other competitors, including other Oral-B toothbrushes.My gums needed some adjusting to this brush coming from a manual brush but in general it is quite powerful. My teeth feel a lot cleaner compared to regular brushing over the last couple of weeks and I have come to enjoy the 2 minute timer as well. Charging is no issue and the toothbrush holds a charge for close to a week - however its just as easy to leave it on the charger as it acts as a stand as well. The downside to this is that it may take up some counter space.Oral-B's own brand offers a cheaper electric toothbrush than this, and I am unsure if there is a major difference. Overall I would certainly recommend this brush compared to a manual one, however I'm not sure I would splurge on this particular model myself.

I have always used a manual tooth brush because I can scrub as much as I like to get my teeth clean. No need to worry about batteries or recharges etc. After receiving this oral-b power pro I am switching to a better way.The brush head is small enough for me to get at my gums even at the back of my mouth which is something I haven’t been able to do with the other powered brushes. I like the feel of the bristles along with the rotating action. It feels like I am really doing a good cleaning job on my mouth with a lot less effort.It’s a powerful no nonsense standard brush that’s easy to use and clean. The handle seems to fit my hand in such a way that angling it to get the tough spots is a breeze. All things considered I feel it’s a quality brush that will last. One that I will want to keep using.With the brush head reasonably priced and it being a recharging unit this Oral-B Power Pro is well worth the bucks.

Purchased this as my last Oral-B electric brush finally stopped holding a charge (after 11 years). They don't appear to make that model any longer, but hopefully this one will have a similar longevity. Even if it only has half the lifetime, I'm pretty sure I'll be satisfied though. This one too works great (so much better than a manual brush, that they aren't even comparable). I'll NEVER go back to a manual toothbrush again, and I do believe Oral-B is the best!

Don't misunderstand. This is a good toothbrush. it is just in no way worth the $50 it is currently listed at. The toothbrush being sold for $33 (vitality 3d) is essentially the same toothbrush body however it has the better heads (with the gum massager). In addition, this toothbrush only comes with one head where as the Vitality 3D comes with two. The only way this toothbrush is better than the vitality 3D is when you look at the packaging. This one comes with a nice box where as the Vitality 3D comes in regular old blister packaging. That's worth the extra $17, right?

Right when i received this in the mail i was so excited to open it. I opened it and noticed i received an extra brush head and i was really happy with that. The toothbrush is built well and is rather cheap. The toothbrush feels powerful and it feels like it is doing a very good job in cleaning in which it is. When i had finished brushing my teeth they felt cleaner than usual which is a sign that this toothbrush is excellent. I do recommend this toothbrush to anyone who needs one or even wants one. I love it

This one is one of the low end products in Oral B electric toothbrush family but the performance is still solid. There are not a lot of bells and whistles.  There is an on/off button. The 2 minutes timer is useful in reminding you of the recommended brushing time. The toothbrush uses recharbable battery which is handy.If you are looking for a simple and basic design that gets job done, this is the toothbrush for you.
